[Music] in this lecture we'll talk about the transit method for detecting exoplanets in the transit method astronomers monitor the starlight of a star for periodic dimming indicating that an exoplanet is blocking out a fraction of the starlight as it orbits so we use the terms transit method or eclipse method equally until the launch of kepler most exoplanets had been found by the radial velocity method this graph shows the phenomenal amount of data released just in the first year or so of the kepler mission as the exoplanet moves around the star it periodically moves between us the observers on the star blocking some of the starlight now notice that eclipse detection or the transit method is only applicable in a subset of the systems where the orbital plane is tilted towards us so that we're looking in the equatorial plane if we were looking straight down on the system from above there would be no transit or eclipse so this method is only possible for a small subset of the exoplanets and astronomers have to make a correction for the missing data here's the detection of a single exoplanet transiting a sun like star now we look in the equatorial plane where the transit can be seen as a short dip as it passes in front of the star this happens for a small fraction of the orbit of the exoplanet so many stars have to be observed at once to have a statistical chance of seeing this effect but there's a problem with this method for typical systems and let's use the solar system as an example let's use jupiter and the sun let's imagine we are observing the solar system from afar hoping to detect jupiter jupiter moves at 13 kilometers per second if you were using the doppler or radial velocity method that's the doppler shift you would have to detect to detect jupiter but if jupiter is considered to transit the sun as viewed from the side which you would do every 12 years it takes less than a day to cross the sun's surface as seen from afar so in a 12 year orbit that's about 1 500th of the time you would have to watch closely so you can see how difficult this technique is because the transit occurs for a massive planet orbiting far from its star for such a tiny fraction of the orbital time you'll be spending most of your time watching the star nothing would be happening and then suddenly for a tiny period of time blink and you miss it there's a transit and an eclipse the solution astronomers use to this problem is not to look at single stars but to look at as many stars as possible so that on average one of them or more of them are giving a transit in any period of time that you observe them so the rare eclipses are essentially pulled in by getting good statistics and large number of simultaneous observations and with the kepler spacecraft this was done by staring at one patch of sky where there were over 150 000 stars all being studied at once here's two examples are shown orbiting sun like stars in one case a small planet causes a relatively small dip or transit in the other case a larger planet causes a larger dip the depth of the eclipse or the dip corresponds to the ratio of the surface areas of the planet relative to the parent star so exoplanet size obviously relates to the eclipse we imagine the planet is opaque and so as it crosses the face of the star it blocks some fractions of the star's light and the ratio is very simple it's the cross sectional area of the planet divided by the cross sectional area of the star that's the fraction of the star's light that is occulted and so the percentage of the star's light that is dimmed when the transit occurs smaller planets have smaller radii and therefore don't block as much starlight during their transit in this animation we add a detail to the transit method where in addition to the exoplanet crossing the face of its star and causing a substantial dip there's a second dip because the exoplanet shines in reflected light and that reflected light goes away when it passes behind the star causing a smaller secondary dip these effects have now been seen in dozens of exoplanets by the kepler spacecraft what happens if a star has multiple planets here we have a top down view but when we're in the equatorial plane there's a possibility of one or more of the planets to transit they will transit with frequencies given by their orbital periods and the light curve on the left will show the relative dips corresponding to the size of those exoplanets in real data from the kepler satellite many instances of multiple planets have been found in this way here's data from the transit and this is the kind of data that you get from the kepler spacecraft showing real data and here you see a transit observation where the dip is something over one percent between one and two percent jupiter is ten times smaller than the sun so if jupiter crossed the face of the sun it would dim the sun by one percent so you can see right away that if this was a sun like star the planet that's being seen transiting is slightly larger than jupiter because the eclipse is slightly more than one percent and you can see other examples here you can see that the individual data from the ccd detectors is quite noisy but because you're averaging over the time when there's no eclipse the small region where there is an eclipse is still very easy to detect and you can also model the data with a curve here's some real transit data sizes measured by the kepler spacecraft and initially kepler was finding far more jupiter sized exoplanets than earth like planets and you can see the distributions here the orbital periods these are now of course earth sized planets on very short orbits so they're hot planets nothing like habitable and these are jupiter sized planets also on short rapid orbits so they're hot jupiters so as we saw hot jupiters were the first exoplanets to be discovered and just as hot jupiters are easier to detect with the doppler method because they have the largest masses and the shortest orbits they're also the easiest to detect with the transit method because if you think about the geometry of a planet orbiting a star when a planet of a given size is closer to the star the odds of observing an eclipse are higher and so it turned out that roughly one in ten planets would transit their stars in the hot jupiter scenario as opposed to a tiny fraction of a percent of earth like planets crossing their star when you're looking for much smaller objects so just as with the radial velocity technique the transit method is strongly preferring to find hot jupiters and indeed that's what kepler was finding early on so just as with the radial velocity technique the transit method is strongly preferring to find hot jupiters and indeed that's what kepler is finding early on the transit method has limitations too planets with a large radius produce obvious dips easy to detect you can see very strong detections here where the noise on the data is almost invisible and the transit is really clear but as you get down towards super earth and earth sized planets the data is much more noisy and it's much harder to detect that dip which of course in the case of an earth like planet and a sun like star is one hundredth of a percent one part and ten to the four that's pretty subtle now the advantage is that you can take multiple observations because the orbit will repeat and when you know the orbital period you know when to add the data from the next time the transit occur and you can add the eclipses together in the case of kepler it was unwilling for the team to declare a detection of an exoplanet unless an eclipse was confirmed twice in other words a single measurement like this was not sufficient to declare the detection of an exoplanet and even the repetition of that one more time was not sufficient that would of course allow you to determine the period but would not confirm the period until you saw it a third time so kepler used the third eclipse measurement of a given object to declare it to be real and of course add the data together having had a third if you had enough data you could get a fourth a fifth and so on and if you're talking about small orbital periods in the mission of kepler you may have dozens or occasionally even hundreds of transits but in the case of an earth like situation with a one year orbit kepler's mission wasn't long enough to find more than a couple of events planets at increasing orbital distances block less light from their star and so it becomes increasingly difficult to detect transits as the planets are further from their star also the transit geometry occurs for a very small set of orbital inclinations and so it's just much rarer to detect and you need to gather a lot more observations to find those rare instances let's get a sense of the amazing diversity of the exoplanets discovered by kepler each little diagram here represents an orbit of an exoplanet around a sun like star or in many places a dwarf star the size of the dots represent the size of the exoplanets the speed of the orbits the speed of their orbits obviously not to real time you can see multi planet systems in a number of cases this is just a subset of the thousands of planets that have been found by the kepler spacecraft some of the fastest orbits relative to the slowest orbits are fantastically fast orbits of less than a day the longest orbits months or years we'll zoom in on some of the most intensely speedy of these exoplanets and the music fittingly is from star [Music] wars to summarize this lecture the transit method measures small dips in the light curves of stars to detect exoplanets the exoplanet is crossing the face of the sun blocking a small fraction of its light leading to a dip in the brightness and the size of the exoplanet is deduced using this method notice this method only gives the size but not the mass whereas the radial velocity method gave the mass but not the size so they're complementary in that sense exoplanet size limits the observation for an earth like planet and a sun like star the eclipse is one hundredth of a percent and the kepler satellite was designed to detect that but not much less and that becomes sort of the limit of the technique also exoplanets at large orbital distances are hard to detect because a very small fraction of the orbital geometries give transits or eclipses
