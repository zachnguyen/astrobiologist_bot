[Music] hi everyone so I'm Lauren and I'm from Anna Lang's Lab at University of Sydney in Australia and today I'm going to tell you a bit about the work I do on model protocells or model primitive cells so I'm sure many of us here are trying to answer the question of how did life on earth begin now I'm focusing on a very very specific point in time when life had maybe begun to transition from super simple primitive cells perhaps composed of a fatty acid bilayer membrane it's a more complex protocells or primitive cells more akin to Modern Biology at this point in time we'd started to see the emergence of phospholipids and some simple enzymes but we hadn't yet thanks but we hadn't yet seen the emergence of all the complex cellular cellular Machinery that exists in our cells so things like membrane transport mechanisms for example that transport nutrients and waste molecules out of the cell maybe they hadn't come around yet so that begs the question how are these protocols actually able to feed themselves how were they able to grow how are they able to divide so I'm trying to answer this question by building a propagating synthetic cell what that basically means is it's an artificial cell that is able to feed itself can grow it can divide and I'm trying to achieve this using the simplest components possible to try and understand how life transitioned into what we know it as today so this involves a pretty large collaboration and with my collaborator in Japan yutatsu he's been able to build a preliminary synthetic cell composed of a phospholipid bilayer membrane also known as a vesicle and this vesicle is composed of a mixture of popc and prpg two types of phospholipids and within this vesicle we have a system that can be used to actually synthesize fatty acids and eventually synthesize phospholipids that can then be incorporated into the bilayer membrane actually allowing it to grow now one of the big problems with this system is that you can only encapsulate a small number of nutrients actually within the synthetic cell within the vesicle there's only room for so many molecules and if you encapsulate as many as you can you only really get one to two percent membrane growth which isn't really sustainable for a cell that we want to make grow and divide so what we really need is some sort of regular nutrient Supply so we need an external feedstock of nutrients that can actually permeate the lipid bilayer membrane to make its way from the outside of the cell into to the inside of the cell that way we can actually achieve continual membrane growth so that's my role in this project I'm trying to figure out a way that we can actually get the nutrients that we need for the synthetic cell to function to make its way across the lipid bilayer membranes the interior synthetic cell so in order to do that I've needed a technique that can be used to monitor solute permeability or the permeability of different nutrients and to do that I'm using what's known as a shrink soil assay basically that involves preparing vesicles encapsulating a fluorescent dye known as calcine when you mix these vesicles with your solute or your nutrient interests the difference in osmolarity actually causes the vesicles to shrink because water rapidly exits the vesicle and we kind of see this these shriveled up sort of shrunken structures and because we've had water exit the vesicles we've actually had an increase in concentration of the diet that's on the inside of these vesicles and that actually causes the fluorescent signal to decrease because calcium is a self quenching diet about certain concentrations so at high concentrations of fluorescence actually goes down rather than going up so it's a little bit counter intuitive but over time if we have a permeable solute so a solute that does actually enter the vesicle you'll start to see the vesicles slowly swell up again and it'll roughly get back to its original size and with that we have a decrease in calcium concentration so we have an increase in the fluorescence roughly to what it was to begin with and we can basically monitor that whole process using some sort of fluimeter or something that can measure fluorescence and we can monitor the changes intensity over time so we can see initially the intensity is somewhere up here and then with the addition of the solute the intensity drops down and then if we have a permeable solute that signal will start to recover and we start to see the original intensity kind of values there now because these intensities are kind of a direct measure of the calcium concentration we can convert concentration to volume so the plots I'll be showing you today show the changes in volume over time and it's just worth noting that the initial stage where the vesicles shrink and swivel up shrivel up actually happens very quickly and the experimental setup I currently have I can't actually see that because it just happens too fast so the data I'll be showing you is just the recovery of that volume so the basic workflow for a lot of my experiments is to First prepare the vesicles composed of an equal mixture of popc popg in 50 millimolar happy so that's just the buffer it's roughly buffering around physiological pH and these vesicles all encounter all encapsulate that fluorescent iron is calcium and then make sure all the unencapsulated calcium is removed and I mix the vesicles with the solute all the nutrient of interest and monitor the changes in fluorescence over time and then determine the changes in volume over time so this is what some of the data looks like on the left we can see some examples of some permeable solutes so our control here was the 50 millimolar happyes in the blue and all of this data is normalized to the volume of that control at time zero so we see in the blue 50mm Heavies it's just a flat line there not much is changing and that's what we'd expect it's our control it's what we made our vesicles in so we don't expect any volume change there but when we mix our vesicles with something like glucose or glycine for example so the red and the purple we see that characteristic curve telling us that the volume is actually increasing after the vesicles initially kind of shriveled up so that tells us that these two solutes are both permeable across these lipid bilayer membranes and glycine is actually more permeable than the glucose because it increases at a faster rate on that plot I also have glycerol at first glance it kind of looks like nothing happens there but glycerol is known to be super permeable across lipid bilayers so it's likely that I just actually missed that initial shrinkage and swelling stage so it just looks like nothing's happened right now because I missed the first kind of couple minutes of this process now on the other plot we have some examples of some impermeable solutes and you can see there's quite a few there so a lot of the solids I've looked at so far are quite impermeable and that's we can see that there's like those flat lines at the bottom there there's no increase in volume over time so over these this time frame none of these Solutions are permeable which is kind of disappointing because a lot of these solutes would be useful nutrients for a synthetic cell things like amp ATP for energy and then something like sodium acetate I was hoping to use as a carbon source to actually synthesize fatty acids and then the phospholipids but it's not particularly surprising that a lot of these solutes were impermeable It's relatively well established in literature child that phospholipid bilayers aren't the most permeable things especially when comparing them to a fatty acid bilayer for example so fatty acid bilayers are kind of useful to think about because they have been proposed to have made up the first protocell membranes before we saw the emergence of phospholipids and we can see in this plot here for something like glucose it's a bit less permeable in phospholipids than in fatty acid bilays there's something like sodium potassium it's significantly less permeable and like over this scale that that's a really significant margin there and then for something like amp and magnesium that's not actually on the scale shown here for phospholipids so it's way less permeable in phospholipid membranes than it is in fatty acid membranes so again these results aren't particularly surprising but I still wanted to try and find a way to actually get these nutrients to permeate the bilayer so today I'm going to talk about a couple of different strategies I've tried to use to actually improve permeability the first of which is modifying the membrane composition so as I said all the vesicles I've been working with so far have been composed of pobc and popg now these lipids are quite nice to work with they're cylindrical in shape so they pack together in these really nice bilayers they're very uniform but what would happen if I were to say disrupt the way the lit lipid molecules actually pack together what if I introduced a leopard with a different shape something like laser PC which has a single carbon chain rather than two but it still has a relatively bulky head group so it has this more conical like shape and when that gets inserted into bilayers it can cause defects to form and pores which would potentially allow nutrients to pass through the membrane so I wanted to explore what effect adding small quantities of lyso PC would have on permeability and the other lipid I looked at is oleic acid which is a fatty acid has a single carbon chain and a relatively small head group but because it's a fatty acid it has very different properties to what phospholipids do so I wanted to explore how those different properties might affect the permeability of the membrane membrane only I found I prepared all the vesicles the same way I did before but added about 10 either lyso PC or oleic acid to the system and generally as I said didn't make much of a difference we have one of our example permeable solutes there so glucose which we saw was permeable earlier we can see in those three curves there isn't really much difference between them if anything the green curve the oleic acid is shifted down slightly but the shapes of the curves are all very similar which is telling us that the permeability hasn't really changed and we see something simple similar with one of the impermeable solutes that being lysine they still have all those flat lines so we saw no improvement in permeability there and this was generally the case across a lot of the different solutes or nutrients that I actually tried there weren't any marked improvements in permeability except for when I tried sodium acetate so when we had the presence of 10 oleic acid in the system we see a significant Improvement in permeability compared to what it was originally with the popcpg system and also compared to adding the 10 lyso PC so we do see that curve that's telling us that the vesicle is swelling up again and we actually have the solute molecules permeating into the vesicle which is good news we saw one of these solutes actually kind of worked and actually were able to permeate the membrane and as I said um it was great to see that it did work with sodium acetate because we wanted to use that as our carbon source for fatty acid synthesis then phospholipid synthesis and that would actually help getting the membrane to grow but as I said overall it didn't work for a lot of the stuff I tried so I wanted to try it a second strategy to try and improve permeability and that was through the addition of divalent cations so in literature it's pretty well established that divalent cations also affect the packing of the way of the lipid molecules so the way the bilayers actually packed together so I wanted to see if that would make a difference to permeability and again generally I found it didn't make that much of a difference except for the presence of sodium acetate so with the 10 Lake acid system and the sodium acetate when I added magnesium chloride which is what we see in the orange there was a Improvement in permeability if you see that curve kind of increases faster than what the the blue line which is just the pure sodium acetate and the green line which is just the magnesium chloride so for whatever reason the addition of magnesium chloride with the sodium acetate and in the temps in oleic acid system did improve permeability overall but again generally I found that this was quite difficult to achieve in a lot of the solutes I tried I've also tried other divalent cations which I haven't shown here um in general it was pretty tough so what does that mean overall so generally I've found that permeability can somewhat be modulated for specific specific sites by changing the membrane composition and divalent cations can somewhat improve the permeability of specific solutes but overall it was pretty difficult to actually see any marked improvements in permeability for a lot of the different things I studied so what does that mean for origins of life well perhaps we needed protein channels to actually co evolve with phospholipid synthesis as I mentioned earlier fatty acid membranes are much more permeable than phospholipid membranes so if they were the first protocell membranes they were able to access nutrients a lot easier than phospholipid membranes on their own would be able to so we've probably needed some sort of mechanism to actually co evolve with phospholipids as they started to emerge but this is a very much an ongoing project I'm trying a lot of different membrane compositions a lot of different divalent cations and I'm still working on other methods to kind of improve permeability so hopefully in the future I'll have some more definitive results with some improvements in permeability for a lot of other solutes too so with that I'd like to acknowledge the entire Land Group and my supervisor Anna for all her support thank you to my sources of funding and thank you to everyone for listening okay we have time for a few questions thank you I am from Ohio University I study multiplayer biology I'm just interested in the method that you use to measure your membrane permeability is it um Arch Clump electrophysiology or what so the technique I was using actually a measure of the changes in volume but it's reliant on the fact that with those changes in volume they can only occur because the solute is actually permeating the membrane so it's actually fluorescence based technique so I use a floor a fluimeter or plate radar depending on the experimental setup I have going to actually measure those changes in fluorescence over time and from that you can calculate the changes in volume which you can actually then go on to work out permeability coefficients from those curves which is something I haven't done yet but you can actually fit a model to that curve and extract the permeability coefficients as well okay I'm I'm just actually thinking that um if you can employ the patch Club electrophysiology method it can give insight into like membrane polarity hyperpolarization yeah which can also give more insight on this yeah 100 in this well the techniques that makes it interested hi I'm Tim from University of Wisconsin Madison um I was wondering uh do you think there could be an effect of physical size or specifically surface area uh on the degree of permeability and if so did you like control for size did you extrude your vesicles I sure did good question yeah so these vesicles for this system I'm working with have all been extruded through 50 nanometer pause um they're roughly they're probably about 40 nanometers in diameter for the most part it's a relatively even distribution added to DLS on pretty similar systems um yeah but that's why I did extrude because I would expect family ability to be affected by the size of the vesicles thank you very much Lauren [Music]
