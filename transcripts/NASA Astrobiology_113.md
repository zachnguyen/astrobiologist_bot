[Music] hi everybody good afternoon Welcome to our astrobiology program Town Hall uh we're very excited to have everybody here today um hopefully there'll be some information that'll be useful for you um some things that you may be interested in and want to reach out to uh or some information you may want to follow up on after this meeting uh some questions you may have a whole bunch of different things that may interest you um we have a number of great folks here to talk with you both from the program from the rcns from some of our Mars missions or our Mars planning so hopefully there'll be a little something for everybody today um I of course am Lindsay Hayes I hope that at least some of you recognize me or had a chance to talk with you or something in the past I am the program scientist for astrobiology here at NASA headquarters um and our our major thing that we're going to start off are the let's say it this way the three things that we're going to talk about today is you know sort of astrobiology on astrobiology in NASA we're going to talk about sort of a new person that we have on board who we're pretty excited about so we'll talk a little bit about the astrobiology program at headquarters uh we'll talk a little bit about the rcns and we'll get a briefing from each of them and then finally we'll talk about a couple different Mars activities that are happening at headquarters um and and outside of headquarters as well so the first thing that we're going to do today is I'm going to kick it off um by having Danielle or sorry I'll be kicking it off by having David greenspoon our new senior scientist for astrobiology strategy David why don't you introduce yourself all right thanks very much Lindsay uh and good afternoon everyone um this is really exciting for me to be here as the new senior scientist for astrobiology strategy I'm going to share my screen um and uh we will attempt to um whoops it wasn't that wasn't right one second um here we go uh we'll attempt to uh describe to you what that means to have a senior scientist for astrobiology strategy um here we go all right um first of all before I describe what this role is I wanted to just briefly introduce myself um because I know a lot of you know me some of you don't um I'm a planetary scientist astrobiologist my research has um through my career has focused a lot on evolution of planetary atmospheres mostly terrestrial planets but also some Icy Moon atmospheres surface atmosphere interactions hydrospheres biospheres studied stable isotopes large impact events um and a few other things uh I've been a TI on exobiology grants several other NASA research programs a co i for The astrobiology Institute um the pi on the NSF life and extreme environments program um Kawaii on a on excess um uh exoplanets atmospheres modeling project um and a few other things I've been on missions I was the interdisciplinary Sciences for Venus Express um I'm a Kauai on DaVinci I was a coali on the uh actually the koi for astrobiology on the rad instrument on a Mars science laboratory um I've been the science Champion for uh NASA Mission studies um and um and also as it says here a Kauai on many rejected Mission proposals and a pion2 rejected uh Nai lead team proposals which um as many of you know is actually uh painful but but good experience as well um at least two of my rejected Mission proposals made it to phase a and then not phase B so um anyways uh as far as EPO um I was uh I think the first curator of astrobiology at a major American Science Museum the Denver Museum of Nature and Science I've taught astrobiology at uh multiple universities and written books op eds magazine pieces podcast planetarium shows online courses all that stuff um and then as far as uh other relevant activities um I was the inaugural Bloomberg chair which is the chair of astrobiology at the Library of Congress which uh by the way was an amazing experience and is now open for applications for the next round and um I want to urge you if you've ever thought of taking sabbatical to work on a project that is astrobiology a decent but it has to do with Humanities uh it's a really amazing program and it's we've we've emphasized Outreach to um to people from the humanities historians and and others and so forth to try to get their numbers up but it's open to scientists who have an interest in the humanities and it's it's really a great opportunity and uh urge you to think about applying I've been on science definition teams for Missions and uh decadal panels and written white papers anyways this is all to say um for those of you that don't know me I'm uh a member of your community who is now somehow found himself on the other side of the fence at Nasa as the senior scientist for astrobiology strategy uh we want to emphasize this is a new position um and we're uh We've created new leadership roles uh which will endeavor to briefly describe to you as the senior scientist for astrobiology strategy I'm largely responsible for trying to expand the astrobiology program both within NASA and and Beyond NASA in ways that um I'll elaborate on in a minute and we have two other new leadership roles uh program scientists for astrobiology um which uh will be Lindsey Hayes and Lindsay's going to come on in a minute and describe that to you in more detail and Deputy program scientist for astrobiology which will be Becky McCauley wrench and they'll be responsible for running all the programs that you're already familiar with and I will be primarily responsible for trying to expand astrobiology in various ways which I'll know very briefly run through this is of course as you know a very exciting time for astrobiology and um the program is in great shape thanks to the work of previous leadership and and the really amazing team that we have here at headquarters and at the centers um I I'm not here to do any major surgery uh the program doesn't need that but there are opportunity opportunities for new opportunities for uh expanding astrobiology that we'll be talking about um and of course we're at an incredible time with the potential for making important new discoveries through interdisciplinary research um and that potential has really never been higher some future directions I'm looking at and remember I'm the new guy I've been here for a month and so this is all notional and I'm very interested in feedback and ideas but uh what I'm thinking about right now um I feel like the the primary role that I really want to focus on is increased cross divisional and cross directorate activity in astrobiology at Nasa the current divisional structure within SMD um largely predates the discovery of exoplanets and the significant placement of the search for Life as a cross cutting theme for NASA science so we have of course these silos and there's a reason for that um it works to have different parts of our science uh managed in different parts of NASA but there's also a risk there that we we miss the cross divisional opportunities and so a primary goal of mine is to raise visibility of the astrobiology program increase connectivity look to bolster existing activities with new models of support for interdisciplinary and cross divisional research projects um and uh I can elaborate on that I won't too much now both in the interest of brevity and because I'm just starting but I've I can tell you I've had preliminary um meetings with all of the science divisions at Nasa and there's a lot of recognition of the untapped potential there uh as well there are possibilities of new inter agency um cooperation with uh for instance with NSF um primarily but also other agencies and I really want to look at revitalizing International connections and collaborations which you know had great start with Nai and have been a little bit dormant in the last few years and some of that you know they're not all created equal and some of them were more successful than others but I think um that's definitely I want to look at which of those um could perhaps use some uh renewing and revitalization with those International Partnerships um public private Partnerships there are some really interesting efforts by some companies now to get into uh astrobiology missions in some ways that uh expand the repertoire as far as risk posture from what NASA is used to doing and I think it's worth um looking at those and letting what help we can to some of those efforts and uh definitely want to um make a fresh look at role of astrobiology and NASA missions the uh all the way through from conception through uh proposing and selecting through the science teams of the missions and then the RNA programs uh there's some obviously really exciting upcoming opportunities and um we just want to make sure that uh participation investor buyer astrobiology and the missions is where it should be um other possible um probable future directions there's been a lot of um work in the post discovery planning and imagining as far as the communications um as you know there have been some recent activities with um trying to um come up with best practices for how we will uh communicate discoveries that are on the path towards finding life and those activities will continue Daniella Solis we'll talk a little bit about that this afternoon but also I'm interested in the possibility of uh doing more planning and imagining of post discovery science if we succeed in finding life um you know of course we phrase things a lot is that's what we're doing we're on the Quest for life but if we succeed in some dramatic or or gradual way that is not the end but it's a new beginning for astrobiology uh a new phase of comparative planetology that involves comparative biospheres and biochemistries and so forth and and what would that science look like I think it's worth our devoting some more attention to that um I have an interest in in the connection between astrobiology and climate change Global sustainability and so forth uh as you know we're we are in a global climate crisis and um well that's not exactly what we're focused on there are some interesting connections we as astrobiologists um have a perspective on the role of Life In global cycles and uh I think we have a contribution to make to that um climate emergency um in both science and Outreach and that relates in an interesting way to studies of the anthropocene uh as it relates to astrobiology some of which I've been involved in and that also urges into questions of the future of life and even techno signatures what does it mean for a um technological civilization to alter a planet to being become part of the way a planet operates and is that something we can not only uh participate in and imagine uh on our own Planet but but uh but um search for and be prepared to possibly find elsewhere um and of course we need to plan for the transformative potential of new technologies like artificial intelligence machine learning uh Network um small satellites uh there's already of course amazing um progress that's been made for since using um AI for uh protein folding studies and I think uh you know nobody knows where it's going but it's worth our um devoting some attention and planning to how we're going to maximize these Technologies in the future um there's also we've had some recent um work done uh um we've been doing some work on ethical issues in uh in our field work um which is an important question of course because uh the places where we do field work are are owned by indigenous communities who care about those lands and who who have knowledge and wisdom that we ought to connect with um and so this is activity that's going to you and um Daniella scalise I think is also going to uh address this a little bit um later this afternoon um in addition to um these new efforts um I will be uh having strategic input into some of our existing programs uh for instance um uh additional looking at additional models of uh support and structure for the rcns um we want to we want to look at these questions are we maximizing the openness and transparency and and regular processes for the rcns or how can we improve that and one thing I'm wondering about and maybe I don't need to but um it does the how does the RCN structure affect overall cohesiveness of the larger Community is there any risk of sort of fracturing into separate communities I've seen this happen without for instance in planetary science with the the AG structure where um you know we end up sort of inadvertently pitting the inner planets people against the outer planets or the icy Moon people and I don't think that's necessarily happening here and of course I want to acknowledge it not all of our resources contained within rcns I just think that's a interesting thing to look at beyond the RCN structure how are we maintaining cohesiveness as a larger Community um be taking a new look at the relationship with the the centers astrology at the NASA centers make sure that we're maximizing um the uh the interaction with and use of the great talent we have Beyond headquarters within NASA um and then of course we have a great team here and I think you know them uh working on communication and engagement within NASA within our scientific community and and with the publics but that is also a major interest of mine and so uh I will be working and trying to help um expand and um just uh enhance those efforts and uh and Community Building as well so uh one other thing I wanted to mention we're looking very seriously at doing a new astrobiology strategy um it's been a decade since the last astrobial strategy document and of course Lindsey Hayes ran and A lot's happened in that decade of course there's been a new decadal survey uh we've had concrete evidence of habitable early environments on Mars dragonfly has been selected and and we're going to fly that to Titan uh there's been some incredible discoveries uh with exoplanets that that practice won at multiple planets in the potentially habitable zone just for an example and tremendous progress in understanding the biology and environmental evolution of the early Earth all of this is new much of this is new since the last decadal since the last asked to biology strategy so we're um we don't have a definite plan but it's something we're seriously considering and would love your your input um on that and and one thought I had would be that it might be fun and perhaps instructive when we do this to look uh at least for some part of the exercise look more than 10 years ahead I mean one unique thing about our field is the long timelines of our investigations um and that's you know sometimes frustrating but also um very exciting the sort of multi generational aspect so it would be interesting to look farther you know 20 years from now maybe we'll have samples back from multiple targets and uh hwo will be operating we'll be planning new next generation of of uh space telescopes and maybe we'll have multiple have found multiple biosignatures um or or maybe we won't you know what laboratory and analytical techniques might we have access to and what what what our science look like on that that kind of time scale so um I want to wrap up here turn things over to Lindsay but I just want to um finish by saying that you know I'm just getting started I'm the new guy and and uh my main first task is to listen and learn I know I have a lot to learn I really want your input and your feedback you know what's working with the astrobiology program what can be improved how can NASA headquarters help uh what how can we make things run more smoothly transparently equitably what future directions and opportunities should we be attuned to um I will be reaching out in multiple ways to try to um have conversations and and learn and listen and connect with you I'm going to be attending DPS and agu other meetings I'm gonna um I already have plans to visit a couple of your research centers and I'm interested in visiting many of them and meeting with the RCN leads uh you know one question is uh about town halls like this uh what should we do in the future what what do you think about the Cadence uh and the format and what kind of topics should be raised um and along those lines I'm going to be um I think I'm going to start holding uh what I call office hours which I'm going to have regular time it might be Friday 11 to 2 but stay tuned I'll let you all know when I will just be um in my office um for people in the community to make appointments and talk about whatever you want to talk about um just as another means of getting feedback and I think Lindsay we were talking I think Lindsay's planning on starting something like this as well so we're both really interested in um hearing um what you have to say about all this and um so with that um I thank you for listening and I'm going to now uh turn things back to Lindsay thanks David and I've said it before but welcome again we're really we're really happy to have you um so I'm gonna share and give some present give a bit of my presentation as well um and I'm actually going to start uh with a quick note um that is you may have noticed a little bit of awkwardness at the start um there is actually a tiny bit of a lag in our presentation between what we're actually talking and what you guys out in YouTube land are seeing um and so uh that means that I'm telling you now that uh there is of course uh the question and answer section that you can see in the agenda uh we will be taking questions at that point but because of the sort of lag if you want to start adding those questions in the YouTube chat now um we'll be ready then have those all queued up and ready to answer during that point in the agenda with regard to the agenda if we do wrap a section early and there aren't a lot of questions that are coming in um we actually will just take a pause um so that we will start everything on the time that it says in the agenda um so that if people are joining us at a particular time they're not going to miss anything and then finally just one another node programmatic note the recording will be available afterwards so if you ever want to go back and look it's something that we talked about um it's available there so thank you all for that um again thanks for the introduction or for the the Handover David um I'm going to be talking a little bit about uh the program the astrobiology program and and my role as the the program scientist for astrobiology so um this is an org chart that we really wanted to show as a way to really explain um sort of how we are seeing NASA headquarters astrobiology structured um from this point and going forward um so the first thing to note of course is that there are two things there are two boxes under that first sort of umbrella of NASA headquarters astrobiology there is a senior scientist for astrobiology strategy that of course is David there's the program scientist for astrobiology that's me um and then we have a deputy the deputy program scientist for astrobiology there's more of a direct connection within the program but of course you know Becky and myself and David are all really working together um for this NASA headquarters astrobiology um so there's a there's sort of a table um uh at the legend at the bottom that shows what the different font sizes and what the different lines are we are aware that this looks like a bad Plumbing map with lots of things going to all different kinds of places but if you follow with me I'll try and sort of walk us through this so of course we have the sort of this sort of of three different roles that David mentioned up at the top here David was sort of talking about you know his sort of future connections within SMD interagency International commercial connections that all sort of sits within his bucket here if you follow the red the red lines down here you'll see he also has a direct link to both NASA's Center astrobiology as well as Communications and engagement now NASA Center astrobiology or the sort of civil servant contractor researchers at the center division sectional management and Senior scientists that we have at different NASA centers within the communications box these are contractors and and I welcome folks when I say their names to turn on their camera and remind you of these people that you know and of course will continue to remain part of the astrobiology program folks like Daniella scalise Mike Toyon Aaron gronstel Anthony Chen Marco bolt Tahira Alan Linda Billings sat shakilar and additional contractors and interns who we have um who are fantastic people who are really doing a lot of great work uh within the astrobiology program and are you know we're really happy that they're part of our team um move over one box and of course we have the early career programs um the early career programs are really championed by Melissa kervin Brooks at Ames Research Center um she's you know a great advocate for all of these things um and will continue to be part of the astrobiology program um if we move over here to the research coordination networks um here we would have you know the headquarters Reps for the astrobiology uh research coordination networks myself Becky McCauley wrench Etc um and then um all the way on the right here is the astrobiology research portfolio this is technically under the leadership of the PSD RNA lead this is within um Stephen reinhardt's sort of management as the PSC RNA lead it's worth of course noting that Steven Reinhardt is about to go into detail starting on October 1st uh to the White House for a year um and so Delia Santiago Marie and Kathleen van der Kayden will be sort of joined to occupying that role working together serving as each other's deputies at different times and so you know all of the astrobiology research portfolio is within the PSD research and analysis program and so what happens there of course is that recommendations for selections from myself Becky Jeff wheat all go into that research portfolio this is how it has always operated and will continue we'll continue to operate even as we sort of reorganize some of the other connections here and then finally last of course but not least here is deia activities and this is sort of separated out we have Daniella scalise Aaron gronstel and Melissa Corbin Brooks are the folks that really work on this a lot for us within the astrobiology program but there's connections here of course to Communications to early career programs to the rcns and the research portfolio and so it's worth of course noting that you know there's a lot of different things but the red connections here are the things that we really see as um you know as part of the strategic side of the of the grouping here and this yellow orange line is the way we see connections to the programmatic side so I hope this sort of helps people to to really have a visual sense of what uh what David and myself and Becky uh will be responsible for in working with and and sort of working to develop um in this sort of new model so my next slide I'm going to go just a little bit to remind folks of our RNA and give folks some updates if it's been a while or or you know any sort of thing there we of course have the exobiology the sort of original uh base for the astrobiology research portfolio this is of course uh understand the origin Evolution distribution and future of life in the universe This research is focused um sort of the origin evolution of Life potential of life to adapt implications of life elsewhere we have these sort of five areas of research emphasis um the exobiology program is of course solicited annually and it's a no due dates program and that really means that you should submit the proposal when it's ready when you have it ready when you feel that it's ready for review um one of the things that means is that we've actually been able to get down our uh response time on these and way down from previous years and so we've been able to really get on average responses back quite fast um down to I think my my record at one is a three month response based on sort of when we wound up having the evaluations and everything so you know we're really moving things fast here um one note here is that because of the way that we do the reviews uh we really put some uh additional emphasis on external reviews so if you get an email from myself or Jeff wheat um or somebody else asking for you to do an external interview please if you're if possible please help us out there of course we typically select 20 to 25 programs or proposals a year for exobiology habitable worlds um for you know sort of the Counterpoint uh to exobiology if you think of exobiology as being interested in the the micros and the organisms and that sort of thing habitable worlds is really interested in the environments right we're trying to understand the history of the earth and the life on it as a way to understand processes conditions that maintain habitable environments and search for these environments um off away from the earth that kind of thing this also is an annual program and we did skip a year a couple years ago but this is an annual program um the step one due dates are coming up um in November you can see the dates there uh you then submit a step two proposal in in February of next year note of course that habitable worlds is a dual Anonymous peer review program which means there's a particular way that we ask you to write the proposal so that the majority of the body of the text doesn't really focus on who is proposing the research but the focusing on the research itself and then we sort of have a two stage review process where we focus first on the research itself with sort of trying to remove emphasis about who is the proposers and then once that analysis is done and we have all those scores then we get into focusing like okay well you know are the team that is proposing to do this work really capable of doing it so there is a point where the individuals are looked at and considered um but it's the science first and then the individuals and this is a smaller program we typically solicit five or typically select five to ten proposals a year there's of course P star planetary science and technology through analog research the focus here is investigations exploring relevant environments to develop a technical and scientific basis to conduct astrobiologically astrobial biology yeah astrobiological research on other solar system bodies this is a science driven exploration program and it's really interested in the next generation of Planetary astrobiological Exploration and the teams here will become will become members of one or more rcns this is solicited biennially so it's in every other year program the step one due date the step ones were already due this year so if you missed that unfortunately you're not eligible uh until two years from now um but if you did submit a step one uh we're hoping to get letters out very soon um and let you know uh who should submit a step two next one um is icar uh proposals here that describe a multi million dollar five year project these are the Biggers this is sort of the bigger sister to the exobiology program let's say um for projects larger than the scope of the individual research programs but within the scope of research coordination networks and all selected teams here become members of one or more relevant rcns um we are not soliciting this in roses 23 um but we are intending we hope to be able to solicit it in roses 24. um and I'll note of course that with the relevant rcns we will actually be having each of the new icar Awards um giving a little opportunity to talk about that research as part of the presentations for the rcns in the next round but of course note that it is not just the icar awardees that become members of the rcns um any nasa funded research project regardless of the program that it's funded from that are relevant to the rcns can be eligible to join these RCN so if you're an exobiology or habitable worlds or P star or other things that are not you know even sort of directly part of the astrobiology research portfolio emerging worlds exoplanets research program some of the programs in the earth science division or the other programs in the astrophysics division or other programs in the heliophysics division all of these if their research that you're doing is relevant to one of the topics of the rcns you know we really as part of that coordination activity we'd really love to see you join so I'm going to talk a little bit now that moving on from the portfolio talk a little bit about additional astrobiology activities one thing to talk about is the Nexus assessment we had an assessment of our very first RCN that was undertaken in early 2023. it was a cross divisional review panel co led by Nicole Zellner and Mark Marley and thank you again for both the co leads as well as the panel and and Bradley burkhar who served as the executive secretary the intent of the Nexus assessment was to assess the overall success of Nexus with regards to the goals that it had made it for itself at the start gather Lessons Learned From the first six years of operation and all of the different things that it had done and then of course collect information regarding the challenges that Nexus has faded and really think about these things as a proxy for things to be learned and to assist as well in things that we may want to do with the other rcns so some of the key findings from this Nexus is demonstratively catalyzed interdisciplinary Community interactions in ways that have benefited the community including observing campaigns modeling and input into cable surveys Nexus it's of high value for early career researchers involved in the program and then of course Additionally you know there are some areas that were identified as Improvement in things that we at NASA headquarters are going to sort of undertake some uh considered ways that we may want to to look and just to see this Improvement through including representation in the different topic topical aspects of it how to convey the mission statement how to make sure that the leadership structure and the selection process work well and then of course uh you know sort of this all volunteer model and how can we make sure to have some support and so we intend to release the report in the NASA responses soon so uh Stay Stay attuned to that um unfortunately Becky McCauley wrench was unable to join us any today she's had an addition to the family and we're very excited for her so I'm presenting on her behalf about the 2023 astrobiology Mission Aviation Factory which just wrapped up a couple weeks ago um as you can see it happened at Goddard um in late in August no innovation was contracted to sort of operate this whole this might this ideation Factory there were 32 participants from the U.S and international uh from first year graduate students all the way through to early career faculty many different institutions cross disciplinary ideas the output was six Mission ideas that were presented of the week at the end of the week by teams of three to seven individuals they had seven different mentors who were able to come in and sort of help out in that process and they're planning a follow up activity or we are planning a follow up activity phase two to work on some mock data and sort of think about how we would how we would go forward sort of the next steps here the hope is that this is sort of a start in a way to sort of get more more early career folks involved and interested and aware of the process for Mission formulation all the way through to operation and so we're particularly excited about about how well this went and thank everybody who was um mentors and attendees and all of that and and hopefully look forward to where it's going to go next um and then the last thing I'm going to speak about today is an upcoming biosignatures ideas lab now this one is going to be a lot more of our traditional ideas lab uh the idea is that you start with an input a Grand Challenge topic creative people um some money from the program you create an environment an ideas lab um that's a sort of sand pitch that really works through some really interesting ideas that Fosters creativity and the hope is that the output is a potentially transformative novel adventurous Innovative interdisciplinary ideas with the wow factor and we're really going to focus this one on on biosignatures and biosignature research um sort of how this is involved we have mentors that focus on the topic facilitators that focus on the process and then participants you have a sort of three day residential sand pit real time peer review and then three virtual meeting days that leads to a few project ideas that are that are the sort of ones that become selected and then in a couple months they work in submit full proposals so the idea is that more information will be coming this fall about that and the idea that this will take place in early 2024. and so that is the end of my slide but there's one more astrobiology program activity that we want to tell you about and I'm going to use that as a way to transition to our next Group which is Daniella and Aaron so Daniella thank you very much all right thanks Lindsay I'm gonna bring slides up here and attempt to go full screen so if someone wants to pop in and let me know it's going that would be great okay so hi everyone my name is Daniela I'm very excited to be with you we have some wonderful things we want to share with you today um as as David mentioned earlier there's a workshop that's going to be coming up in the first two weeks of February 2024 and it follows on it's not exactly the same it picks up new and different themes and will be quite different but it's going to follow on from the standards of the evidence Workshop that many of you I'm sure were part of in 2021 and we're calling it communicating about the discovery of extraterrestrial life as many of you are probably also feeling in your bones the discovery may not be as far off as we once thought it was and so we want to organize ourselves and the community broadly and and probably everyone to be prepared for when the discovery is made and to talk about discoveries that are going to lead up to it in the in the ensuing years and perhaps decades so we want to start pursuing the organizing ourselves to communicate about this these discoveries especially the big one so if our aim with this Workshop is to bring together both the astrobiology scientific community and the science communication Community broadly and we're talking about what we've been calling traditional sort of print publication journalism along all along the Spectrum through social media and other types of communicators of science bring these two communities together to exchange perspectives about the potential Discovery the eventual if you like discovery of life beyond Earth so we're bringing together two very different worlds that that have interfaced a lot over the years and we want to sort of enhance that interface if we can so our our goal is to explore what we consider is a mutually beneficial and socially responsible path forward in communicating about the discovery of extraterrestrial life we feel that everybody has responsibilities this is powerful and potent information that's in our hands as the scientific community and we need to come together as professionals and colleagues across the science and science communication worlds to communicate this discovery appropriately and respectfully and responsibly and we want to create with this Workshop we hope that we will be creating a lasting community of shared interest as we walk the journey toward this discovery applications for this Workshop are open now the URL is there and we're going to put it in the chat for you as well so applications will be due November 15th I believe it is mid november and we're going to have selections made shortly after that again looking at the first two weeks of February with I believe three days in each week the rest of that is TBD at this time but looking forward to being with you in that Workshop in a few months okay we're going to move on from here Aaron is going to join me online and this is uh to share with you a few things um about some policy and requirements and and ideas really um towards our towards changing our approach and our scientific culture about our relationship with field work and our ethics around that relationship so I'm going to start and then Aaron's going to take over one of the first things we want to share with you is that last November so almost a year ago a truly amazing document appeared in our world called Federal guidance for departments and agencies on indigenous knowledge um it came out of a joint effort out of the White House ostp Office of Science and Technology policy collaborating with the Council on Environmental Quality it had almost 100 indigenous leadership in the authoring of this document and it's in my opinion tremendous these are some of the three main points that have come out of it guidance from the highest part of the federal government is being offered to agencies to that we should undertake to understand what indigenous knowledge is we should be investing in growing and maintaining relationships with tribal Nations and Indigenous communities um in order to appropriately include indigenous knowledge in everything we do and we need to be considering including and applying indigenous knowledge in everything we do so basically we need to know what it is build relationships in order to include it in our work so this was a truly a seminal document I've been doing this a long time I haven't seen anything like this and we're just thrilled that this has come through the other thing that has come through on this scene over the last couple of years that is sort of emergent with this guidance is some pretty egregious abuse of field sites this is definitely not the norm as you know in our field work Community but some pretty headline grabbing uh Behavior where there was over sampling in some rocks on indigenous lands got some pretty big press and it got our attention because this is something we we just absolutely do not want to see happen on our watch we don't want to see this happen um with our funding and we want to just be part of a movement within our communities with you all to evolve our ethics to make sure that that we're doing things in a good way especially with respect to indigenous lands Waters and skies so our thinking has a has has roots in the excellent field site ethics that have already been developed with respect to participant health and safety how we treat each other in the field codes of conduct uh things like that and with respect to the impact that our activities have on the environment of the site there's a lot of amazing work out there and I think everybody is behaving in a good way with respect to each other and the land itself and and to first order our operating principle is that we know that you love your field sites just as much as everyone else who loves the site loves it so we want to build on on these good things and introduce more consideration deeper consideration of historical and cultural significance of some of these sites in particular with respect to indigenous relationship to the land um I will go ahead and step out and say what I think the truth to be which is that every single inch of land water and sky on this continent known as North America at least and many other places as we know the indigenous the colonized world is vast these lands are indigenous lands whether or not um there's a piece of paper somewhere that says they own them they just are it's just part of the truth of History so we want to invite our community into a deeper consideration of what that means with respect to our responsibilities as scientists as guests if you will on those lands and of course the scientific value and long term preservation and Heritage of our sites okay I think this is where I'm handing it over to you Erin hey hello everyone um So within the program we've kind of been looking at ways to address all of these developments in a field of ethics and and the guidance that we've gotten from the White House and in places we've developed this policy here it was introduced into Rose's 22 for p star so some of you may have seen this language already and and aren't familiar with it um but now in roses 2023 it's an appendix C under the planetary science research program so now anything within planetary science at Nasa um dealing with field work this applies to um and the policy didn't just materialize on its own we did develop it within the astrobiology program and the pack has recently made a finding in support of its development and the implementation um so now what we're doing now is a continuing work on guidance for both proposers and reviewers around this language and and kind of in the process of getting that approved to go out to everyone and what that guidance is is like these are sort of a couple questions pulled from the guidance so far these aren't requirements this is this is meant uh more is a support package for proposers and reviewers it also includes includes resources and examples of how to work with indigenous communities and other cultural groups um the more more suggestions of what to think about if you're stuck in in kind of addressing that the new actual requirement within roses um this process in a new language will also help us hopefully highlight amazing work that is being done within the community and and kind of give us data information on how to how to respond to the guidance from the White House and places like that um we'd like to really kind of show how how our community is responding and evolving to understand our role in in both the research and the communities that were all within broadly so um I guess keep an eye out for that um we're looking at things of you know are there are there alternative sites that you could use have you are you making use of of uh sample libraries that exist you know kind of that question of like do you really need to be there and and why you need to be there um and also really paying attention to the history of the place and scientific research that's been done there is this a site where that's used by a lot of people or are you in communication with the people that have used this site before and and you know what is the scientific Heritage of that site and how to maintain that and then of course you know the cultural provenance of the site and you know which indigenous people or tribal Nations hold history on that land is there an opportunity to communicate with those people and you know obtain permissions from cultural groups even if permits aren't required and a big one is is do you need help DDR help what can we do and so that last one is in bold because that's sort of what we hope to reach is sort of a bare minimum of how we operate um with our work and do you need help in ensuring that free prior and informed consent has been achieved and this is that's kind of a statement that a lot of indigenous communities use and are requesting and ends and putting out there as a hope for for sort of collaboration and communication and moving forward also we really really would be interested in talking with people from within the community at all experience levels um in terms of your field work and learning about what you've encountered uh with respect with respect to field ethics and where we can provide support and what role we should play as the astrobiology program um and we're really kind of interested in early career people and and how you envision the future of field work and the future of field ethics and everything you do in your research so we're hoping to kind of build a community about around best practice um I think this is a real opportunity to make sure work is benefiting as many people as possible and to learn more about where we work and how our work affects affects people so yeah it's moving toward building those new collaborations and healthy interactions and um so please reach out to us if if you want to talk to us or you know hopefully we can set up some interviews with people and maybe you know some community events around around this topic so thank you thanks Aaron and Daniella appreciate uh that input and it's a very important topic so thank you very much for chatting about it um I think it's now time for a little bit of a q a so um Daniela were you gonna ask the question that we can and David and I can answer what we're able to yes okay we have some good questions thank you all for participating in the chat with questions okay first off do exoplanet biosignatures fit within exobiology or habitable Worlds the scope documents are not fully clear so that's a great question um I would say that broadly and most significantly exoplanet biosignatures as a biosignature um fits within the exobiological um if you are looking at exoplanets as a way to understand their the planet's habitability um then that's more of a habitable world's question but if you're really trying to understand you know what would a bio signature look like and what would like you know how would you understand life or how would you look at a biosignature as a way to understand life on another planet that's a that's an exobiology so again the the the easiest way to think about the difference is exobiology is really trying to understand you know universal life the features of life that we can imagine are there regardless of where that life exhibits or exists rather and habitable worlds is really focusing on the environments what are the environments like how does a habitable environment uh originate form continue um on a planet somewhere else awesome thanks Lindsay okay we have another question that is showing some interest in synthetic by astrosynthetic biology is anyone in our community working on this um you know I think that uh the best way to find out whether or not folks in the community are working on this is to sort of uh look out and see but the way that we use uh the way that we sort of think about synthetic biology um as a way to understand sort of Novel groups novel environments that type of thing um certain aspects of that can be funded through exobiology um but you know it's it's certainly not a a large um and and you know sort of major aspect of our of the you know sort of major research thrust um there is you know one individual whose name uh was put forth is Lynn Rothschild is an individual who works on something like this so uh David do you want to um do you have any other comments on this one as well uh well I think uh Steve Benner's group also has done some interesting work um with regard to uh synthetic biology and of course um you know writ large it it does fit into astrobiology if somebody has a you know a brilliant idea as to how to research it uh don't shy away from uh proposing it to us because you can't uh don't think you can find the right program you know we're we're interested and we can we can help you find the right program if that's actually a great point and one I'd like to to sort of double down on and emphasize and that is you know the program officers uh for the different research programs are listed at the end of the call and there's always a point of contact listed and I always encourage individuals to reach out to their program officers um ahead of submissions if they have any questions I try and get uh you know I get I get a good number of questions related to exobiology potential research and try and answer as many of them as quickly as I am possible or am capable of doing rather um but you know the program officers are a great resource for that type of information is this kind of research really more appropriate for this does it fit in exobiology does it fit somewhere else that kind of question so you know reach out to your program officers they are there to help okay thank you we have a question that I think has been resolved in the chat but it's how do we apply to the ideas lab so thank you for your interest in that and I believe the link was posted for you in the chat but go ahead I I do believe uh I do believe the I so the ideas lab as different from the communicating discoveries um the bio signatures ideas lab uh the website is not live that the the information that I have is just a little bit more of a hey heads up this is coming and you know you know this base uh this base to be filled soon um so the best way to get the link when it's available is to sign up for the astrobiology program mailing list because we will definitely be sending that out um on that mailing list um and and alerting folks who may be interested in that so um no link yet link coming soon the best way to find it is to sign up for the astrobiology program email list or just to continue to check uh the astrobiology program website there's always fun things to be found there okay thank you so just to clarify we do not have a link yet for the ideas lab application a link to apply for the workshop for communicating about the discovery of extraterrestrial life has been put in the chat okay excellent and everyone is encouraged to sign up for the astrobiology program list sir and I'm sure links will be put in the chat repeatedly so please do look for that thank you okay we have a few more questions um there's a question that is showing some concern about the P star program element can you talk a little bit about what's going on with the funding and proposal opportunities for p star please yeah so so I'm going to sort of back up and and rather than specifically talk about p star just talk about and the astropiology program research proposal you know sort of writ large you know and just say that um you know we try to be responsive within that proposal um to the types of research that support that are benefited by and that benefit you know going forward our missions um and so that sometimes means some sort of active proposal management or active portfolio management rather and thinking about exactly where the research funding is um and so you know trying to make sure that that's balanced that the needs and the import of all of the different things that are within the astrobiology program um get funded and get the amount of funding that we're able to pull forward within the budgetary environment that we have so you know I think I think the answer is you know we would love to give all of the money to all of the good research that's out there um and unfortunately that's not the budgetary environment that we're in and we're really trying to make sure that that we benefit and that we that we balance that as much as possible uh to be responsive to NASA's mission great thank you okay a few more questions coming sure there's a question about smaller scale funding opportunities do we have that in our portfolio and may need Clarity on that Julia but why don't you guys go ahead well I'll say in terms of research um there is no minimum required for how much you request to promote for a proposal um so if you are interested in you know a research proposal that's one year and that's only going to cost you know a minimal number of dollars there is no reason not to submit it to exobiology you know we have an average you know amount but you don't have to you don't have to meet the minimum to be to be a part of the club um really and truly you know anybody who is interested in a research project um you know of of the size that is appropriate should submit to the research program that they're interested in um we do in both habitable worlds and exobiology we have the option to propose a pilot study which is sort of an intentionally look this is a small project I'm really just trying to sort of do a proof of concept and put that together and so you know that's always an option in exobiology awesome thank you okay next question why were ocean worlds rcns requested but none selected actually um we will have a um ocean world and ocean World relevant icar award which I think is actually what the question is about is about icar um that we'll be talking and talking about the research that they will be working on um when the rcns come up in just a little bit as soon as we finish the question and answer section here so stay tuned and you will see okay great and just in case it was more about the rcns we do have an ocean worlds related art stance so and you'll hear more about that soon as yes okay thankful thanks Danielle yeah okay next question is for Aaron it's for you and I has the astrobiology program looked into section 106 guidelines for treatment of cultural sites under the National Historic preservation act the guidelines would definitely have applicability for astrobiology work field work sites yes Linda thank you so much we have and we are definitely um going to be ensuring that section 106 is referred to in the support package that we create for for proposers thank you okay Melissa the next question is for you can International graduate students participate in early career programs you're on mute Melissa we can't actually hear you so sorry we got you now yeah oh okay um yeah there are some that there are accessible things like the NPP program is fine if the international student is affiliated with the U.S institution that's fine it it depends so they're all pretty clearly marked if there's any questions just reach out to me I'm melissa.cirven nasa.gov thanks we'll put your info in the chat Melissa thank you okay we are going to pause questions for now and back over to you Lindsay and David thank you very much um okay so thanks for thanks for hosting the questions Daniela um we are only a couple minutes behind and so with this I am going to uh pass it over uh to Karen Rogers who hopefully will be able to turn on her camera um at the very least be able to uh maybe share slides or chat with us um who will give the introduction uh to the rcns I can see I saw her pop on for just a moment so can you guys hear me at least we can definitely hear you yes this is progress I'm gonna turn on my camera but God knows I just got a new webcam and so it's unlikely to work with Microsoft teams life life cannot go that well um but let me go ahead and start sharing my slides just give me a minute um well I figure this all out you know how it goes I did mean to do this before um do I have sorry everybody I did try and do this before but everything was broken then we'll go to this mode I don't need to add a background why why somebody quickly helped me with Microsoft teams and tell me where to click oh go to security and privacy screen recording to give permission anybody know got it sure sure you should yeah I'm almost there sorry sorry sorry oh no it has me quit and reopened that doesn't seem like a good thing why don't we um Karen why don't we give you just a minute oh oh we have it it's working there you go fantastic we see your whole screen but that's a great start how about if I do that excellent thank you very much sorry sorry about all the confusion there I can't see anything um except for my PowerPoint so you'll have to bear with me and sort of yell at me um if uh if if I'm going over time so Lindsay asked me to give sort of a quick overview of the rcns and then I'll um slide right into the RCN that I co lead which is pce3 um and so I'll I'll do this pretty quickly I I'm starting to put these slides together and I got really nostalgic about um sort of how I got into astrobiology so for those of you who don't know me um Carrie Rogers I'm up here at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Upstate New York I study extreme life in Prebiotic chemistry and I'm gonna sort of take you through the the sort of RCN bit I was putting these together and I was thinking back to the very first astrobiology science conference I went to I was in grad school I was very early in grad school and we were for those of you who were there or remember we were intent at NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field this was back in 2000 so almost 25 years ago now a quarter of a century and it has been really quite a ride um this there was an article written by Timothy crawl who wrote this up and I just loved some of these quotes that I wanted to share this particular meeting differed from other origins of life and exobiology meetings and size because it was 500 people instead of the typical 100 or 200 participants um and then this part is great being the first astrobiology conference created an excitement in the air as if a new science had been born and the participants were in the delivery room and that's I think that's pretty spot on um for the beginnings 25 years ago so but it also really gives this historical perspective on sort of why astrobiology is sort of in this mix of really sort of going through an evolution it's because it's been um almost 25 years and so um here are some pictures actually from the conference that happened four years later it was the third one you can see the tens are still there in the background there's uh Crystal Kay and Lynn Rothschild and you know we were out at the first one we were out at this Irish pub and one of the one of the deer chemists said to me you know great if we got all of us who are you know some of us work on carbon and appetite and some of us work on you know microbes at the bottom of the ocean wouldn't it be great if we could fund a bunch of big programs so these people could get together and of course that had started just two years ago and that's when the Nai began and I would say that really sort of launched um the astrobiology community we know today course it's been a long 25 years that astrobiology conferences have gotten much bigger we're up to nearly I think 1100 was what we were at in Atlanta and that the community has grown um the conferences have grown the the entire astrobiology program has grown and I've I've benefited from that right I I started when it was barely a thing and and now I'm I'm sitting here and we're all sitting here and I'm really I'm really quite amazed at the fact that we did give birth to a scientific community and it has grown into that that is largely because of the hard work of everybody at headquarters everybody out there and really under the phenomenal leadership and and guidance of of Mary wojtek I think it's interesting that Mary is now at NASA Ames I hope there aren't still the tense up from from 1996. uh the thing about this evolution is that the the entire Community has grown so much that the program has had to change and that's really I think what sort of inspired the the rcns and so when I came in this is sort of what astrobiology looked like um we had I think I grabbed most of these programs and got them kind of correct um you know we had the Nai teams that were funded by Nai we had exobiology emerging worlds P star they've changed names a little bit over time and then there was everybody else and they're sort of all in the gray right um every astrobiology is quite sort of quite large and and has quite a bit of disciplinary breadth and what happened over time is that all of us happened right there's so many more of us now that it was hard to get together in those 100 or 200 person meetings and really talk to each other and so astrobiology needed a little restructuring so we could talk to each other again and in the way that was done was through the research search coordination networks that are organized by topic now and so those of us who work on say origins of life where in one RCN we kind of all get to talk together but we talk to the folks who work on exoplanet which is the Nexus RCN we also talk to the bio signature folks and they talk to the ocean World folks and they talk to the life Evolution folks and so what I think of is the rcns is really just a restructuring to make sure we maintain these communities that we've built but still are small enough that we that we can have real conversations um it's a piece of our success that we've grown so big that we that we really sort of needed to have this this ability to talk to each other so here are the logos for all the five R stands I'll take you through them really quickly so there's the Nexus RCN that's our very first one it was established in 2016. that was followed by pce3 that's Prebiotic chemistry in early Earth environments and then enfold which the network for Life detection and now the network for ocean worlds and finally the the life RCN which is early sales to multicellularity and you'll hear from everybody there um in each of those in just in just a few minutes and the the um the image you have on the bottom uh is is something that you know we Nasa uses all the time I actually stole it off the NASA astrobiology website so thank you everybody for for putting this together and it kind of helps to map the mission of nastra astrobiology and the the definition of astrobiology right which is the search for life's origin Evolution distribution and future in the universe and it Maps those four things origin Evolution distribution and future to these rcns and also the NASA Earth Sciences division which which we won't talk about today but I'm sure David and Lindsay are happy to to to expand on and so I'll give a real brief overview of what the rcns are there's not a lot of um stuff here but the the rcns are us they are a community collaboration Network we are organized um each of the rcns is organized by the community around these themes where NASA really has coalescing research ideas the leadership is composed of the co leads there's usually three to four for each RCN as well as the steering committee uh the steering committees are funded pis from roses um and the icar uh that said the membership the Affiliates the people who are associated with each of these five rcns is huge and really really quite open um I would I would say that all five rcns have this really sort of open door policy if you want to come play in any or all of the rcns you're certain certainly welcome to to do that and so it's really this sort of open science concept that allows any anybody who's interested in these fields to come and join the the conversation so the activities of the rcns um vary across all five of them there are seminar series and workshops early Career Mentoring and networking opportunities there's um proposals that get put together we we spend a lot of time looking at Mission development and Mission targets and we've all together we've actually submitted we submitted quite a few decadal um white papers for the last to the last decadal so the last thing I'll say which isn't on here in and Lindsay can talk a little bit more about this but the rcns are not a funding source um we are literally all of you we are the community of scientists and we're just trying to bring people together so we don't really get money and we don't really have money um we are just people working together who are interested in these topics and so it is really the the groundest of the ground up kind of kind of communities that said we're very integrated into the entire structure at Nasa both in planetary science and in astrobiology this is a this is my last slide on the rcns but you can see how all of the rcns here are really integrated to to the missions at Nasa so that's my quick overview I probably went too long because I was having trouble in the beginning so I'm gonna go speeding through now um I think I'm the first RCN up and so I will talk about pce3 which is the Prebiotic chemistry in early Earth environments Consortium so what we are um is a community of scientists striving to transform the origins of Life Community by breaking down language and ideological barriers enhancing communication across disciplinary divide between early Earth geoscientists and Prebiotic chemists what we really are interested in scientifically is the to investigate the delivery synthesis and fate of small molecules under the conditions of the early Earth and the subsequent formation of protobiological molecules and Pathways that led to systems harboring for the potential for life so one of them the one at the top is the community aspect and the one on the bottom is sort of the umbrella of the science that we do I want to recognize my other co leads Ron krishnamurthy Tim Lyons and Lauren Williams I think they're out there in the YouTube Universe um and we also have a number of volunteers that work with us from the steering committee from the team members and honestly the community at large we have a workshop organizing committee we've had several now we have um our seminar series co leads we have early career advocacy we have a Communications team a steering committee that I'll show you in just a minute and the Tipsy organizing committee which is which is a little teaser for one of my slides at the end so this is our group of um steering committee right now so these are all pis funded under roses or icard um they obviously come and go as people's Awards sort of run out and new Awards start up and it it makes for a really nice Dynamic group of people we get together and we talk about what this community of scientists needs um and might want and we try and pull ourselves together to put put some of those activities into place so we have one new um icar so we have a steering committee member Scott Sanford who just joined us Scott couldn't be here today but Michelle Nuevo is here to tell us a little bit about this icar effort at Ames Research Center so um if you're out there and can unmute that would be great and I'm just going to sit here and leave my slides up hey can you hear me yes okay great thanks um so yes we are not new into the astrobiology effort because we've been part of the Nai for for quite a long time but this is a new proposal that was just selected through the icar program and basically it's uh it's an interdisciplinary program that will combine this modeling lab experiments and quantum chemistry computations and the main purpose is to understand how getting molecules in particular Organics of astrobiology interests are made during the formation of planets in the in the in the gist and so we want to investigate these conditions that lead to the origin of those molecules how they are formed where they are forming the disk and where they end up in the end in the in the planetary systems and so uh different uh the three different tasks do different things but we compute different parameters for chemistry that would be used in the lab and also in this modeling and we compare uh this modeling predictions to up to actual uh predictions of observation uh from uh astronomical observations and also uh we do experiments in the lab and one of the things that we do also in the lab is to analyze uh extraterrestrials temples to actually validate what we find in in in in our research and we are deeply involved in the Osiris Rex mission that will come deliver samples that were collected on an asteroid at the end of this month and so we will be first hand to to uh to analyze the samples for the search of Organics and we are currently also analyzing sample from another mission that went to collect samples from another asteroid from the Japanese space agency Hayabusa II and so um we are we are trained to understand the formation of those molecules a very very different perspective and try to to get a whole story about how molecules of astrobiological interests were formed and how they connect to the origins of life so that's our main goal thank you so much I really I really appreciate that um so I'm gonna move really quickly forward through just a little bit of what pce3 does um broadly in science and we sort of started to cover that here um and we're gonna ask you to wrap up in just one minute if you could one minute okay so thank you fascinating um so we do everything um scientifically from print planetary Evolution through Prebiotic complexity so as you can imagine most of what that takes is communication right and so I'm going to skip over a few science slides and just really talk about what we do to bring the community together and so we're always getting together at apps icon we generally report to caps and pack we did submit a bunch of these white papers but the really big ones are our seminar series our newsletter our special issue that's um coming up and our and our workshops so these are just a few of the um Decatur white papers and workshop reports um that came through uh recently I wanted to introduce you to our Communications team and our seminar Series team they're listed here our seminar Series has now been going on for two years with over 100 people showing up um every three weeks when we have it so it's really it's really quite phenomenal when it comes to participation um the last thing I want to tell you about is our community workshops we've had three now our very first one was building a new Foundation we had it online in 2021 in 2022 we had the Nano to Cosmic studies of complex systems and what is coming next are our Tipsy workshops I will tell you that we have our very own YouTube channel um and just the videos from the very first Community Workshop has over 23 000 YouTube views so I think you should check them out a lot of people use them in their classes so what's coming in this Tipsy idea is um is actually a mini Symposium a sort of a half day workshop is all we're going to do and what we're going to do is we're going to pick specific topics that people really need to get into the into the details of and so here are here are some of the topics that are coming down the line I put this up there because these will all sort of be or most of them will be done in conjunction with the other rcns and so um that's I'm going to let them all tell you about what they're doing right now and I just wanted to end with these last beautiful images that my colleague Jana awasa put together in a review paper that we wrote with um with Justin Trail at University of Rochester so I went about a minute over but I think I ended mostly on time I'm I'm gonna stop this slideshow and try to stop sharing if I could we can we have ways of stopping you sharing thanks Karen very much appreciate it um next up uh will be Allison Murray who's going to be talking we can see you Allison although we don't see any slides yet um who's going to be talking on behalf of the network for ocean worlds or now and we can see your skin your your slides now Allison um although I will note you are on mute um so uh when you don't start talking until you take yourself off mute thanks and do you see the are you seeing the right screen yep that looks great okay um thanks Lindsay and Karen for doing a great introduction um the network for ocean worlds was established in 2019 and one of the things that um I think as Karen was introducing the concepts between the rcns you know NASA really created these to facilitate communication between the groups of researchers that it funds and um and so uh we have a large team of co leads in part because one of our charges was to really work between planetary sciences and the Earth Sciences division so we um have just gone through a rotation of some of our leads and we have two new ones Jackie grebmeier and Dustin Schroeder who um are uh coming and representing the Earth Sciences division of both biological oceanography and cryosphere Sciences uh the goal of now overall is to accelerate ocean worlds research by facilitating communication among active research teams across NASA divisions and by expanding community wide engagement we're collectively interested in comparative oceanography between Earth's ocean and Technologies used on Earth and what we can learn about the ocean worlds and the solar system the um there are sort of a profile of who is in now currently is we have about 102 members of the steering committee we have those members of their their teams and then we have a large group of network Affiliates of over 700 people this is what Karen was referring to we welcome anybody can join we also have a an early career group that I'm going to tell you a little bit more about another slide um we uh are a large group because a lot of different programs feed into uh this um the network and ocean World science from both technology and science and um as well as Earth uh the Earth Sciences division so if you are funded in one of these programs doing something related to Ocean World science you are welcome to opt in and contact us if we haven't contacted you already um you can also join us an affiliate like I said and you can do that at oceanworlds.space um our newest uh member of the um steering committee and and a team in our program um was just recently selected in the icar program that Lindsay referred to um and I've invited the lead of that project Brent Christner to just um give you an introduction to what they're going to be working on Brent can you turn are you here yes can you hear me Allison yeah uh greetings everyone and I'm very pleased to have a little of your time to introduce a project we're very excited about uh called above and below we are a group of Engineers astrobiologists microbiologists synthetic biologists and astrochemists that have a unified uh interest in Ocean World exploration and the expertise to study uh the Exotic conditions that exist on their surfaces now is this community is aware NASA is dedicating substantial resources for the search for life on Ocean worlds and the possibility of a flagship mission that would go to one of these places and search for Life uh be that something that lands on the surface or does that from orbit would seem to be something that is more an issue of if um of when not if any Mission that's intending to detect biosignatures in these harsh environments needs to know how cells cellular structures informational molecules and organic compounds are affected by the ice composition the high radiation environment and the low temperature and pressure but currently this is not something that we know a lot about so to address this fundamental problem the overarching objective of our project is to prove understanding of biosignature potential to advise future efforts to plan to search for biosignatures on cryoices in Ocean worlds next slide please so our proposed experimental approach is to examine biosignature preservation and cryo ice compositions that range from defined mixtures which allow us to identify the effects that individual impurities would have to Natural brines to compositions which have actually been designed to stimulate the ice compositions which have been inferred on Europa and Enceladus and using the icy facility which currently exists at NASA Ames we have the ability to do these experiments in situ into ice films that are no thicker than about two micron so to simulate these experiments in much thicker ice columns we'll be modifying an existing cryovac facility that is currently maintained by Stone Aerospace and it'll be able to provide four different classes of ionizing radiation to the ice with this infrastructure it allows us to carry out two types of tests one which we've called ice lab where we actually construct large blocks of ice and place them in the chamber and establish conditions and in other classes of tests which we are referring to is plume and this these are experiments where we are going to attempt to simulate cryovolcanism by injecting micro droplets of materials into hard vacuum and very low temperature now it's important to note that when all these these capabilities are implemented this is going to represent a cryovac facility that will be available the community that's really unique from many other in existence offering testing capabilities for any Ocean World surface as well as lunar and Mars um regolith and ice experiments next slide please so in the case of Europa it's one of the most extreme environments on the in the solar system and attempting to simulate the highest radiation uh energies that hit and surface are very challenging so consequently what we have done when we were developing this project is try to determine a relevant dose that could be delivered in a reasonable amount of time and that would enable us to determine to get quantitative results versus depth so the compromise that we have selected is to do experiments over a range of dosages that extend up to about 10 000 gray and that's shown in this graph by that yellow vertical line and from this we can we can do these dosages probably in about nine hours and from this we the idea will be to extrapolate to effects at larger doses so in summary the above and below project is going to generate the underlying data upon which any light detection strategy can be tested and evaluated providing the type of quantitative information versus ice depth that'll be essential for any astrobiological mission to an ocean world thank you well thanks Brent [Music] the the this that sort of spans a couple of the priority research themes that um were really in decided upon by the research coordination Network at our first kickoff meeting um these include physical and chemical properties of ocean worlds searching for evidence of Life analog studies on Earth to inform ocean worlds research and development of Technologies for future Ocean World admissions the um Network activities I'm just going to go through uh what we do um kind of quickly here uh we um are playing we expand the membership and provide mentoring we catalyze Communications we facilitate meetings field trips and workshops encourage public Outreach and education and are pursuing new synergies uh outside of our Network and I think um this is important and something that David Kern spoon was mentioning in his uh introduction too um we are primarily a Communications Hub and we these communications are available to everybody who's an affiliate member um that we have from our website we have monthly newsletters uh topics of field research programs or recent Publications are submitted to us in our program called Making Waves we have a jobs board and we have a quarterly lecture series that's open to the public that has we have one coming up on the 16th of October um we are um we also serve a role as playing as communicating with a scientific community and um that is both within our discipline as well as expanding out beyond our disciplines as we did with this recent special issue in oceanography um we have in active um early career group called The Future leadership leaders of ocean worlds or flow um they have uh taken off on their own they have their own leadership with the co leads Laura Alta and Miriam shown here uh they have activities they they come to our Syrian committee meetings they have their own meetings on a monthly basis um we are participating with them in uh collaborative Coffee hours which we're going to restart up with this fall um they participated in a recent Retreat that I'll tell you about and they are taking the lead on our inclusion diversity and equity and access committee as as well as holding a discussion sessions this fall on mentoring best practices uh as the activities that we we participated in or are participating in were um really excited about this new ocean worlds working group that is collaborative between OPAC and sbag um which is developing a cohesive strategy for ocean worlds exploration this is just started up uh late earlier this summer um we I as part of the network activities we have facilitated different types of proposal development activities to to bring teams together um and also I've been participating at the sort of pan uh RCN level to to discuss the future of um astrobiology uh we um are just coming off of a retreat that we held a couple weeks ago we had 51 people um that uh including steering committee members team and their team members as well as people from flow which comprised about 40 percent of the group um we went out to the Wrigley Marine Science Center at Catalina Island and in this isolated uh place we're able to really be present and delve into um ocean worlds topics really with the intent to bridge between the earth based ocean science and planetary ocean and planetary ocean science research and Technologies um major goal here was to Foster Community Building build future collaboration opportunities and and encourage the participation really involve the participation of early career in this um we identified synergies and Technology development that are mission related on both both Earth's Mission and planetary missions and we're planning on producing an ocean worlds Field Guide it will be a living resource for the community to really help the communication between these different fields because this really spans a lot of a lot of science we had thematic modules and it was a pretty Allison one more minute if you're if we can thanks um we had a pretty intense week and schedule we covered a lot of topics um and we offered we had a practical experience learning about oceanographic sampling ROV operations um different kinds of Technologies using ocean Optics as well as we met with different programs considering future research opportunities and I think it was very successful it was an interesting week we were out there when the tropical storm hit Southern California um but it really came out I think is a great success um and I'll just go through this we as a part of the community we have identified high priority needs in really accessing um relevant um both Laboratories and maybe Brent's icar will help access this but for laboratory but also field places where researchers can test and do research with instrument Technologies um that will be the topic of a workshop hopefully this fall um we have um we'll be developing this field guide we have special session at the ocean Sciences meeting which we're accepting abstracts and um hopefully planning future meetings for ocean worlds five and maybe through a Gordon research contract conference format so thank you thank you so much Allison um next we have Brooke who is presenting on behalf of the network for Life detection or and cold uh Brooke take it away and I will I'm going to break in and give you a one minute uh notification thanks all right thanks Lindsay um so yes I'm part of network for Life detection or enfold as we call it um it's led by myself Alfonso and Heather and then Bradley runs the administrative aspects to keep the network running at a fast pace that we're trying to achieve we have a total of 45 47 steering committee members currently five special Mission focused members and 76 early career members now as a reminder after we heard a lot about this at the very beginning of the Town Hall but the decadal strategy specifically asks the question is there evidence of past or present life in the solar system beyond Earth and how do we detect it so enfold's goal is to help inform life detection strategies for upcoming missions now we bring researchers together with engineers and technologists to specifically improve uh performance and add robustness to the life detection technology and research fields so enfold can provide the life detection expertise to a wide range of people to frame science questions set expectations for data collection inform instrument design and build cohesive strategies for future missions and we generically do this by building a community that will first and foremost promote discourse relevant to life detection specifically we try to encourage debate between engineers and research scientists we have Forum style talks on the research and Technology within the steering committee and those act as in general when we have these foreign style talks we also have other talks that are called think tanks which allow us to provide basically expert level feedback on such things to analysis groups like me pack or opag Graham our lead for encot team also provides lots of the communication aspects or he's the lead of the encot team and he does this through newsletters blogs social media Communications and you'll see throughout my talk I'm providing a variety of um QR codes so that you can get more information if you're interested now to bring up the next generation of Life detection scientists and Technology experts we have a very active career early career Council the ECC is currently led by Bonnie light and as I mentioned we have 76 members so their presence actually really boosts their steering committee events um soon they'll be leading their own think tank in October where they'll be presenting their own research and in general the ECC team managed lots of our communication and social science events for example they offer up a monthly shut up and write event on Zoom where members can log in and this increases collaborations within the the group itself and um across the different astrobiology fields and I think it also boosts their publication rates they offer workshops and life detection q a sessions too now as I mentioned we offer think tanks and forms that people are welcome to watch these are open collaborative discussions that identify benefits and challenges and limitations to life detection missions and we discuss topics relevant to to missions that are and all the research that's been conducted by the SC members and their teams format's a little unusual in that we open it to public presentations these are live streamed and recorded and you can see all these now if you or you're interested they're all on our website and then we close the doors to have a steering committee discussion and this is to really encourage direct feedback brainstorming and networking so the goal for these meetings is to really emphasize debate and get discussions to be Lively so we can figure out what needs to happen for us to move forward in life detection strategies so our 2023 series was focused on Ocean world analogs and life detection Tech where our first talk was on peptides as life detection biomarkers and their analysis on Mission suitable orbitrap math specs that was followed by Enceladus ice grains and an Oleander Tech and we had astrobiology of ocean worlds these a great series of Talks by the way I highly encourage you to go look at them then we looked at the latest breakthroughs in nanopore and Nano Gap technology lipid biosignatures and mass spectrometry detection and then last we had a talk on Mission Readiness and breakthroughs on microscopy for Life detection and again as I mentioned all these are recorded on webcasts now if you watch them all you'll see that there are seven several common scientific threads or outcomes from these discussions first off organic chemistry is a key Focus for Life detection in Ocean worlds that transition from non life to life encompasses a spectrum of abiotic Prebiotic and biotic with kind of ill defined boundaries right so if we don't know what life is or where it begins how do we know what to look for so we're arguing that these analyzes should include molecular level building blocks all the way to complex biosignatures there are significant developments being made and a variety of biomarkers that can demonstrate they can provide environmental context within the actual chemical composition and then molecular complexity index has been a very high topic of discussion as a potential promising method for agnostic life detection but does need further validation so we're encouraging that there are a range of Life detection technologies that conduct ultra sensitive organic chemical analyzes remotely and on other planets I've listed a few again these are some that we brought up in our talks and these Technologies can Target specific compounds or can conduct broad chemical surveys and look for multiple clues that might reveal origin or biotic or abiotic aspects some of the technology gaps we've noticed as we've done these discussions sample acquisition and handling is a concern there's a need that's been focused on a need is focused development of technology for large volume sample prep for concentrating organic molecules and cell cells specifically we see a gap in the reduction of milliliter volumes to microliter volumes for analyzes for for specific instrumentation and we also see that there's a need for platforms that share these samples between instruments now if you disagree with any of those we encourage you to attend any of these talks that we're giving and and give us your feedback so infold also runs a variety of workshops um the first one I'm presenting here is we ran a standard of evidence for life detection Workshop in 2021 I believe this was a collaboration with Nexus and enfold Workshop was in response to a paper calling for a framework for reporting evidence for life beyond Earth and it builds off the criteria from a ladder of Life detection specifically introducing a framework to evaluate any putative biosignature and it uses five questions that cover biosignature detection biosignature context and assessment and a goal of the workshop again was to assess and challenge this framework that they built with a range of examples and if you're interested in this um and the progress that's going on with the standards of life detections or sorry standards of evidence for life detection there's a QR code here for the white paper that's archived and the cap subsequent review of the standards of evidence framework then in 2023 in collaboration with the network for ocean worlds um we ran the ocean World analog field site Workshop um and the goal there was to standardize criteria for field site Fidelity and help investigators identify High Fidelity ocean and world and analog environments specifically they were interested in building a comprehensive framework that addresses five key questions that I put over here also we're interested in making sure we have standards for predicting sites and promoting sustainable field work in the future and last one of the primary goals was to build Partnerships between institutions and investigators for future field work proposed A Narrative Approach and a matrix approach that provides standardized Equitable tools to assess and defend the Fidelity of ocean World analog field types and it was brought to my attention in general the uh the classification and a series of both The Narrative Approach and the Matrix approach are applicable to any field site selection one of the other outcomes of that Workshop has to increase the diversity inclusivity and the equitability of astrobial default field research we generated an interactive map and it's available on our website that will help you make connections for new investigators who who are looking at doing future field work in 2021 um one more minute Brooke right uh we brought together in fold and Nexus to build a simulated mission that detect life on a new ocean World um this was at the University of Washington um they got to design their own mission and run their own experiments and analyze over a total of 90 data sets which was concluded in a live three hour debate and I wanted to point this out because it was a beautiful collaboration that brought together over 30 astrobiology experts from many of the research coordination networks they're hearing from today laughter team generates public accessible research highlights and the latest findings and life detection Tech this one is from Allen Hills meteorite that was showcased by the program officers at NASA headquarters when they presented their progress report for astrobiology and we make these every month and they're easily accessible on our website thank you for your time thank you very much next up is going to be Rob zellum presenting for Nexus but I am going to give a quick reminder that we have an upcoming q a period if folks have questions so make sure to get them in the chat and we will answer what we can in the meantime finally I will thank Brooke for her great presentation on behalf of enfold and invite Rob to start sharing his slides and we will uh and we will hear about Nexus oops and can you see the slide okay yes we can cool thank you for having me everyone I'm Rob I'm presenting today on behalf of our new Nexus co leads um over Colin uh Hillary Hartnett Jessica noviello Linda Sol and myself um we're all new here except uh Jessica has been an excellent sort of Common Thread that's been guiding us new co leads on how to run Nexus and how to prepare for the next two years so uh Nexus stands for NASA's Nexus for exoplanet system science and what we're ultimately doing here is we're working together to find life in the universe so Nexus goals are can only really be achieved by interdisciplinarity so we're aiming here to bring together planetary science Earth sciences heliophysics and astrophysics to help us study planetary habitability and the search for life on exoplanets in order to answer these fundamental questions related to Planet formation Evolution diversity habitability and signs of life and membership is open to any scientist working on Nexus science areas we encourage you to join uh as I mentioned earlier Nexus is really working to help bring these communities together to Foster communication folks working together so for example we're building community and advances our science in workshops and conferences such as Hab worlds bio signatures techno climbs uh we're collaborative exoplan observing communities so for example the James Webb Space Telescope early release science uh proposals came out now naturally out of Nexus and all the work that they've been doing there the science working groups we have intermodel comparisons habitability quantification techno signatures and science Communications and we have quarterly steering committee or Pi meetings we have a slack workspace which I'll be talking about a little bit later we have working groups early career channels so it's really easy to stay and talk to folks and to help communicate for your slack workspace we also have newsletters website publication bulletins and email lists as well so I want to run through our new icar groups here uh the first step I'll be talking about is the Champs team which is led by Kevin Stevenson out of Johns Hopkins APL and the science Pi's Ravi kabaralaru at uh Goddard and ultimately what they'll be doing here is they're aiming to answer the overall arching Science question of Ken and dwarf planets support life and if so how do we best observe and characterize them and by uh to answer this question they'll be focusing on four core tasks here they'll be looking at planetary processes of mdorf's planetary atmospheres start Planet interactions and exoplan observations and all their deliverables are from one task such as task one are then used as inputs the next and they're looking forward to James Webb observations that will also yield quantitative constraints that feedback into their models uh the next group is if I microwave out of Goddard as well the garden super space studies and uh this is habitability space which is exploring a new frontier via climate models and planetary statistics and they've broken up their study into three themes the First theme here at the top right is going to be studying Venus Earth and Mars through time with global circulation models to determine how habitability is imprinted on planetary Spectra their next theme is then exploring habitability across a range of orbital parameters such as orbital eccentricity or obliquity and then their third theme is that all their models and the results will be publicly accessible for comparison with a future and current observations so it'll be a nice community resource for folks to use if they get observations on James Webb they can compare that to all the work that's been done by this group our next group is the virtual planetary laboratory led by Vicky Meadows at University of Washington uh and what vpl is focusing on doing is searching for life on AXA planets by first creating a network of networks of five rcns to identify novel bio signatures in the context of early Earth environments then they'll be understanding the environmental context and develop statistical Frameworks to interpret bio signatures they'll be then obtaining James Webb observations and simulating observations as well a planetary systems to help detect these uh terrestrial planetary characteristics and then lastly they'll be using simulations and Frameworks developed in the identity and the interpretation and detection tasks to assess how well we can discriminate between a non living solar neighborhood or uh on a living cellular neighborhood looking forward mostly to habitable worlds Observatory and our next group here is led by pi Dave Green at CU Boulder which is the retention of habble X atmospheres and planetary systems and they were looking to answer the overall dream question of how do the properties of a planet and its host star influence its ability to retain an atmosphere and they have these four overall objectives here the first one is to compute inputs for atmospheric escape and uh for an ensemble of star planet scenarios so looking at Stellar U of V For example their next objective is improving and linking the models for atmospheres escape from any planets then their third objective is to construct a multi dimensional model library for atmospheric escape and this will all be hosted on a public web interface for folks to use and then lastly it'll be applying this model library to understand the connection between atmospheric escape habitability and observations as well as I mentioned in the very beginning of this talk we have a bunch of future plans and upcoming events as well have a little world's free Workshop will be happening uh the date is to be determined but we're seeking leadership committee members now and one way to get in touch with us about us is through our website or our slack channel uh there'll be a really strong Nexus Presence at the Venus workshops in Albuquerque New Mexico in late October uh we'll be restarting our webinar web series as well which will be uh publicly accessible to the entire Community to call on and learn about various parts of Nexus and hear from some of our working groups and if you're interested in helping out that just send me a slack message on our slack workspace we also went under a recent programmatic review in early 2023 we're now assessing this and incorporating some of the recommendations uh we're hoping for more interdisciplinary involvements risks particularly from the heliosphysics division so if you're interested please do sign up and we're working on developing a new brand challenge to catalyze the broad Community collaboration across the whole data model divide for AXA plants to make sure that data is helping us out any issues that are in models and using models as well to help it or interpret our data from telescope such as James Webb foreign shout out to pause our professional advancement Workshop series which has been led by Jessica she's been doing an excellent job of establishing and running this group for early career researchers to explore different career paths and own new skills so this provides early career folks the space to network and learn together this is obstensibly open to all members of the rcns within the NASA astrobiology program or if you're interested in participating uh send Jessica a message and she can tell you if you are able to join your nuts these are fully virtual they're monthly meetings there's a monthly there's a workshop coming up in January 2024 and you can find more information about pause here on their website you can also scan this QR code as well and there's also a link from the main Nexus website as well uh soon I always wanted to also give this quick update on our change of leadership I just want to say a quick shout out thanks to all the HQ reps and the NASA are the co leads that have been establishing Nexus and making an amazing really appreciate all the foundation they've been laying and all the excellent work they've been doing and here are the new HQ reps and co leads and uh big also shout out as well to not only the former co leads who have been extremely helpful in helping us figure out what to do but also Jessica Novelo as well she's been a huge help so lastly I wanted to leave you with this last slide on how to get involved in Nexus you can become a member of a relevant accepted NASA proposal you can participate in our workshops our conferences and other community activities or lastly you can join as a Nexus affiliate there on that URL or you can scan that QR code that we've left right there so thank you so much for your time and really appreciate it thank you so much Rob appreciate it uh finally up we will have Frank and Ariel to talk with us about the RCN life here's Frank Ariel are you on as well and there you guys are the floor is yours gentlemen all right folks can you see my screen I hope and hopefully you can hear me as well uh we are the the last last up and we were the last launch of the life RCN launched at ABS icon 2022 and then we formed our steering committee and really got rolling uh last fall so in a sense this is kind of an annual report for us uh who are we well we're a growing Community dedicated to understanding life Planet co evolution uh recorded in a number of different um uh places in the rocks and genome databases and extent biodiversity as well as modeled in silico or through lab proxy studies we are a community that wishes to develop a science of living Worlds by looking at life planet co evolution and asking questions like what environmental pressures mechanisms evolutionary opportunities first gave rise to Cellular life cause life to expand to a planetary scale led to eukaryogenesis and favored the transition to multicellularity our goals are to understand how major biological Innovations shape The evolutionary trajectory of this life Planet system and to discern the rules of Life Planet coevolution so as to predict how life could evolve on other worlds and inform our search for it who are we uh our the co leads are myself and Ariel Mary drozer and betuel qachar um with Becky as our point of contact this is our growing uh steering committee of uh exobiology uh researchers and we have a active early career investigator committee consisting of these individuals who've played an important role in getting our seminar Series going and we'll play important roles in our upcoming Workshop that we'll tell you about momentarily so what are we doing to reach our goals well our Charter said that we were going to try to bring together a large community paleontologists geobiologists molecular biologists evolutionary biologists as well as welcoming people who are theoreticians uh as well as experimentalists uh investigating evolution of catalysts Pathways networks compartments across scale from macromolecules to ecosystems and so we're involved in Outreach we have had a presence at AB gradcon 23 we are putting in special proposals for absicon 2024 and importantly the life membership uh has leaders in the Gordon research conference circuit uh Society for molecular biology and evolution and agu in addition at our respective institutions we're organizing relevant local symposia so for example at my institution Georgia Tech a big deal on our campus the Symposium and this 2024 topic is on the evolution of multicellularity and cellular differentiation being co organized by Will Ratcliffe and many of you know and myself as I noted our early career folks have really spearheaded efforts to get our speaker series off and running and these are live streamed first Monday of every month uh 30 or 40 minute talks followed by moderated q a and we kicked off this summer uh with Maria Gomez from UC Irvine a great talk on microbial communities followed by Paula who educated us on Archaea and we have an exciting lineup coming up for this this coming fall Steve Patricia Galen and chenmayi and the last individual from Ames whose field is instrument development space biology represents a an effort by the early career folks to bring people involved in Mission development to speak to the is a group of largely evolutionary biologists so the next seminar up is uh that of Steve Vance at JPL geophysical investigations of habitability and icy ocean worlds we encourage you to join us for this here in just a few days other goals I'm going to turn this over to my colleague Ariel and Barr now because Ariel and betul have spearheaded the fall virtual Workshop nitrogen cycling across planetary scales Ariel in this RCN is the selection of Health components my life and how that comes a revolutionary time and how that shaped Evolution uh so I'm talking about this he identified that the particularly interested right now nice and cycle so we are organizing a virtual Workshop I can cycling across planetary scales it's going to be two mornings October 18th and 20th there'll be boards circulated about this any day now if I hit your uh [Music] soon uh Ben Johnson at Iowa State and Eva so we can see Andrews are really spearheading this the school and I are helping catalyzed through oxygen psychosphere or catalysts and the basic Spirit of this is that uh as the session synopsis a life requires nitrogen um there's been a lot of evolution recently in our understanding of Imagine cycling on Earth how does that inform how should it inform future astrobiology missions um please ask about the exploration that's what this Workshop is really all about so it's going to bring together people who understand the earth side the life side as well as Planetary Exploration and the goal is to develop a bit of a white paper on what are the key questions that the future research should focus on nitrogen cycling as it relates to astral biology all right you want to just pick up the next slide here sure so we're going to close out here just by talking about a couple of icars that are now affiliated with this RCN so one of them is uh the Muse icar meta legalization and selection across eons the tool is the pi PPI you can see here this other this list of other Illustrated folks who are co investigators in this project and next slide broadly this project is about understanding uh you can kind of we like to talk about it as the the rules of element selection in life why does life choose what it chooses in terms of elements uh to what extent it doesn't have to do with availability of the chemical elements Through Time versus the particular um uh chemical properties of chemical elements so those are importances in the interplay the community that is is interesting but poorly understood the focus in particular on the nitrogen cycle but not not exclusively um and um so we we bring together then these brings together uh geoscientists and life scientists to try to understand the interplay between geochemical availability and biochemical need and chemical function and how that shapes the evolution of of a particular metal use in enzymes like androgenase of the nitrogen cycle uh next slide uh the icard's already been somewhat productive uh as you might imagine since we're interested in metal use over time we're interested in that means we're interested in oxygen but we're talking because that affects the availability of key transition metals especially our hobby courses one of them which is important for nitrogen fixation and the nitrogen cycle um so we've had some recent work um around uh you know reassessing um uh the rise of oxygen in earlier history and its effect on the limited availability in the oceans uh really cool paper by Evans at all here that uh establishes that hydrothermal systems which here before top and thought of as a major source of living in the ocean which they aren't today probably were a major source so these is a non trivial source in our key and oceans uh in a sort of much more anoxic world and then a variety of papers here um we hear Garcia peng and Kenzie ordahls are are just three of a slew of papers coming up from Basil's group um that are looking at ancient proteins and doing various other things to to try to stand the evolution of these intelligence essential time I won't go into any detail about any of those which is back to Frank so again what are we doing to reach our goals in terms of research we have one icar Associated a new icar selection associated with this group and we've invited uh the the pi namely myself to tell you a little bit about this it's entitled engine of innovation how compartmentalization drives evolution of novelty and efficiency across scales really excited about this team that includes um uh Jeff Shelley uh uh uh Joshua Chris John Victoria Alexis and Boz from Boulder and um and Blue Marble Santa Fe ASU and Caltech a turning point in life's history occurred when populations of self replicating molecules Across the darwinian Threshold to cellularity and so the Hallmark of this transition was in closing a self replicating molecular system within a boundary and so once in clothes like this the Living World began to diversify driven by biochemical and morphological Innovation within departments so compartmentalization is a principle by which living systems are organized today whether that means co localizing proteins and small molecules in separate phases or dividing Labor uh within and among cells so we Define a compartment as a structure in which exchange of components with the surrounding milia is restricted often but not always by membrane or protein shell and we hypothesize that this compartmentalization increases flexibility and or efficiency in acquiring processing and serving resources across scales from the molecular to the ecological so we're going to be uh investigating increased compartmentalizations or architecture increasing in complexity from Prebiotic uh aggregation as seen in number one so Alexis is involved in this sequestration of problematic metabolites number two encapsulation of enzymes and bacterial micro compartments number three nested metabolic compartments number four and serial endosymbioses number five and microbial consortia either in the laboratory or in nature number six and then obviously this will produce uh experimental data sets from a range of abiotic and biological systems that display distinct compartmentalization mechanisms and Jeff and Chris will be using tools from statistical physics metabolic modeling ecological Theory and population genetics to quantify the benefits and the costs associated with compartmentalization and provide a common theoretical framework for this cross theme comparison so um last minute Frank yes and I'm gonna finish on time so uh just to remind you that we have this online community seminar series and that we have workshops we invite you to these uh everyone in the community is welcome and encouraged to join in if you're interested in being on the steering committee and have NASA funding please contact us and circling back to uh Karen's last slide just to emphasize that we are part of a network of networks that supports the the overall NASA Mission and we have our uh looking forward to connections with Nexus and now and I think already have connections with enfold and pce3 and uh with that I will just say uh I thank all my other RCN co leads for their contributions uh today and look forward to the question and answer so thank you very much thank you very much Frank and Ariel appreciate it and I love that you wrapped us back back around to the start it's a great way to uh to show all the connectivity so thank you very much um we are going to do a little bit of a question and answer section now um so Daniella if you have any questions um and we'll call the particular if we if we have if we need a particular RCN lead we'll call your names out to answer those questions so uh Daniela what do you what do you have for us on the questions okay we've got a few questions that have come in and the first one I think we're going to ask Linda Billings to say a few words but all of you as well please are there any policy related workshops from astrobiology point of view the short answer is no the longer answer is there are many different places uh to to look for um policy guidance or policy recommendations of course the White House and Congress provide an asset with policy policy uh directions um the national academies of science engineering and medicine has the committee on astrobiology and planetary Sciences their meetings are public and they're almost always webcast I belong to a group of Scholars called The Society for social and conceptual issues at astrobiology we meet every other year um we're a group I'm a social scientist myself we have many philosophers and ethicists and some astrobiologists uh participating in Social as we call it and our next meeting will be in Finland next year but no no no specific astrobiology policy related workshops that I know of thank you very much Linda thanks did you um David or Lindsay want to add anything actually I'll jump in really quickly to say that um if I can put in another plug for the Bloomberg program at the Library of Congress um there have been a lot of activities related um to astrobiology and uh larger questions of the humanities um in terms of the Theology and history and ethics and and so forth um none that specifically have um about policy but about their sort of policy adjacent and and if you go to the uh the clergy Center at the Library of Congress though the website or the scholarly wing of the Library of Congress um you can find a lot online all the past um symposia and seminars are um are captured and recorded there and as well uh I just another um you know there are open applications if anybody's interested in applying to be an astrobiology gayer in the future it's really a good opportunity to explore are the intersections of astrobiology with other areas include policy awesome thank you okay we have another question about the uh pertaining to the rcns does enfold have a seminar series like pce3 and lifehap hi um I can answer that um yes uh we do and it's on our website we post it in our newsletter as to when they're being offered but we honestly respond to um we don't we don't pre plan our entire year we have a seminar series we listen to the discussion and then whatever comes out of the discussion is how we navigate the next one that we're going to pitch so you have to follow the newsletter which you're welcome to subscribe to fantastic thank you so much Brooke um and I'll note um I believe that the website for all of the rcns um have been shared in the chat if that's if if any of them uh piqued your curiosity or your interest while you were listening the presentation you could either find those websites in the chat or you can go to astrobiology.masa.gov um and there are links there to all of the RCN websites where you can sort of continue your journey and look for for more information um I know that we have a couple questions that are still sitting in the chat but in the interest of trying to keep us a little bit closer on time I'm going to suggest that we take our five minute break now we have one more 15 minute question and answer period at the end of the of the whole town hall um and so I want to make sure that we have an opportunity to chat with our Mars folks uh while getting close enough to the time that we ask them to come and chat with us uh so let's do a five minute break and we will be back in just a few uh to hear about the Mars future plan as well as uh the international Mars ice mapper thanks folks [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thanks everybody appreciate you sticking around and we have some really interesting presentations now the first off will be Tiffany Morgan who will be presenting on the Mars future plan Tiffany afternoon I am going to share my screen now and folks see that looking great thank you okay so good afternoon I am Tiffany Morgan deputy director for the Mars exploration program and I'm going to tell you about the Mars exploration program's future plan which is exploring Mars together and that's a draft plan for sustainable future uh for the site for science at Mars 2023 2043 uh you'll see a handful of names over here on the right hand side of the screen these are co leads that have put together uh this amazing future plan there have been many other people that have contributed as well but these are the the primary folks from NASA's jet propulsion laboratory as well as the science Mission director at NASA headquarters team there we go okay so just a quick recap reminder of Mars exploration program and everything that we've been doing for the last two decades or so this is the Mars lead chart and what you'll see represented here are both U.S missions as well as other International missions the the NASA missions are the I guess it's a light blue color across the top you can see many orbiters the last Orbiter that NASA launched was Maven in 2013 under the Scout program and then over the last 20 years or so we've had NASA has put um down four Rovers and two Landers with Mars perseverance being the last one moving forward you'll see the sample retrieval Lander as well as the Earth return Orbiter and between those three elements on Mars those make up the Mars sample return campaign in addition to the sample receiving project that we will have for a facility on Earth additionally we'll be working with Issa on their Rosalind Franklin Mission which is looking for Life present life as well along the bottom of the chart you can see the themes that we've had over the last 20 years follow the water found the water explore habitability determine jezrael was the best place to look for signs of ancient life and then through all of this we have been preparing for the future human explorers okay so on to a little bit of background and the introduction to our exploring Mars together plan as I mentioned we've had two decades of very successful missions to Mars orbiters Landers Rovers and collaborations with International partners but what we haven't done in recent years is address critical aging infrastructure at Mars so as I said before Maven was the last Orbiter that we have launched and that is those orbiters are critical to us for science Imaging and Communications so we need to ensure that we're addressing the infrastructure at Mars that we've become so dependent upon most of the missions on Mars are well into their extended missions perseverance being obviously the newest one and it is also into its extended Mission past the Prime mission um you know from a science Gathering instruments on board not in terms of the Mars sample return campaign but everything has has performed successfully and are now into their extended missions I've already mentioned that we're preparing for human Presence at Mars and with this this future plan one thing that has changed for us quite significantly and just amazingly awesomely is all the additional here agencies and partners that we might have available to pursue science on Mars with us so there's much more International participation than there was the last time we put together strategy and a lot more commercial interest as well as a lot more commercial capability so we want to account for all this this changing environment and this new paradigm or our future plan additionally we have more sample return my sample return has been cited as the most important um you know Mars science for the last past three decades or over the last two decades critical chapter for everything that's going on on Mars to return those samples analyze those samples learn from those samples evolve the science that we want from those samples but at the same time we want to be able to like I said before address our infrastructure as well as have some other science uh orbiters and and uh surface access for science so this future plan is over the next two decades and we want you know a whole bunch more data while we're doing more sample return and we want to incorporate our partners internationally commercially and and then across all of the science communities so what we've done or what we've started with because we did take a lot of inputs I would say over the last three or four years for many different organizations and we've had sags uh we had a A Kiss Workshop we've had um industry days we've worked with uh measurement development team you'll hear from I'm in later that that measurement development team really um or measurement definition team really helped us inform a lot of the things that went into this so we've really focused on a lot of those inputs in the last year or so but we broadly looked uh greater across like the last three or four years and we had a sag that said um you know what what science should we focus on within our mepag science goals for low cost and what can we do in the next couple of decades and so we came up this AG recommended and and the team assessed and and is proceeding with these three co equal program science themes one explore the potential Martian like support human exploration of Mars and discover Dynamic Mars and discover Dynamic Mars is to me a little bit more Network science or system science looking at things across the globe a little bit more holistically but I think of most interest probably for this audience is explore the concepts for Martian life so I'm going to go into a little bit more detail here So within this this science theme we have three primary goals one is searching for biosignatures past and present understanding temporal and Geographic patterns of habitability and examining this example examining the samples from MSR to understand Martian geological biological processes if you're familiar with the decadal one of the things that the Decatur called out uh is the the Mars life Explorer or Emily and we've generically taken that um concept and called it search for life and this is something that we've incorporated into the future plan and one thing that's up and coming is a joint search for Life sag between astrobiology and Mars communities to help us identify where we might want to go on Mars to search for life and then what technology we would need to develop or to evolve to search for life in those areas so that is a a key tenant of what we're doing in exploring the potential for Martian life as well as um you know knowledge driven uh Discovery driven uh science that we we gain from the samples the knowledge that we get from um those Mar sample return assessments and Analysis and then I don't want to leave out physical access we're also looking at drills I think that that search for Life sag will also help us identify if if subsurface is where we want to go and and what we need to do in those areas so what we've done to make sure that we can accomplish this science is we've put together four different initiatives as as the framework or the foundation for this future plan the first one is to expand opportunities to explore Mars through competed lower cost more frequent light opportunities so low cost is is an area that we want to explore and make sure that we have opportunities there and that really helps the system science but there's also some medium cost and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute strengthening and broadening the infrastructure in in order for us to enable the low cost emissions we need to make sure that there's infrastructure there to support those missions so that the missions themselves don't have to bear the brunt of incorporating the infrastructure also key Technologies we want to really beef up the the technology program we have within Matt Mars exploration program for future future missions and then of course um last but not least is is the people and we want to enable participation in Mars exploration for all communities so a little bit more about each of those initiatives okay so uh mentioned the lower cost more frequent flight opportunities we'd really love to be able to take advantage of you know launch every 26 months to Mars and what we want to do in this area is compete small submissions at 100 200 to 300 million dollar level and and that could be a mix and match and this draws on experience from the lunar programs the cots and the clips programs and we're looking at different one step or two step processes but this is really becomes kind of our sustainable base for for the Mars mission to make sure that we we have opportunities at every launch and for new scientists uh for people to you know Garner more science data we also have the medium class missions and this is where you know an Emily or a search for Life type Mission would fall into this is strategic decadal class science more complex instrument Suites and um you know scalable to significant discoveries and then the last uh area or the last objective in this area is so that we can take advantage of our partners launch opportunities so we want to do competed payloads so that we can be flexible to quickly and responsibly respond to any opportunities that come our way not just the the base framework that we're planning for but be able to take advantage of of any opportunity we can to go to Mars in the area of infrastructure these are somewhat prioritized with a separate category for infrastructure under access to Mars but as I mentioned before we have the Mars Telecom Network we no point in doing science if you can't get the science data back we need to be able to have that science here high resolution imaging high rise on Mars reconnaissance Orbiter is almost 20 years I'll be 20 years old in 2025 uh so we want to make sure that we have that capability on Mars Global meteorological monitoring I mentioned you know Network science as well as preparing for humans this is critical in that area sample handling and receiving so that would be the the facility the sample receiving facility that we're preparing for the the return samples ground receiving networks data infrastructure visual visualization and Analysis and then in the area of access to Mars uh spacecraft delivery so this would include ride shares uh you know propulsive access and then payload hosting opportunities area of technology these are not prioritized but uh entry descent Landing systems and surface access continuing to evolve our Technologies Technologies there aerial Mobility Institute surface Mobility novel surface mobility and autonomy revolutionizing uh subsurface access up to hundreds of meters Institute sample handling pre processing and Analysis primarily primarily on the uh the sample handling facility Institute remote sensing and search for evidence of Life measurements again this ties back to that search for Life sag and the recommendations for technology development would directly feed into this area and then lastly direct to orbit direct to Earth and proximity Telecommunications and then in the area of um you know deia and inclusivity making sure that our underrepresentative communities are involved in in the Mars and exploring Mars we want to involve and support underrepresentative communities through internships Mission teams leadership training opportunities we want to enhance the state of the profession in terms of demographics career opportunities and having a culture of inclusivity creating opportunities for public participation new models for Community collaboration and of course respecting the role in the stewardship of Mars for Humanity so how does this all tie together this is the aspirational timeline to a sustainable budget for the Mars exploration program what you'll see here in the swim Lanes across we've got Mar sample return across the top and then we have this this framework or this foundation of the New Missions the new science missions the competed science missions and the next four swim lanes and we have infrastructure technology and international opportunities the areas that we might want to to leverage any additional opportunities that we can with our partners and then you'll also see kind of the budget down here um we've got the past budget which is everything to the left of the gray dotted line and you can see we've had a lot of Peaks and valleys with with larger missions and what we're really and if you move remove those you have really um a pretty a pretty low just um Baseline budget and what we're trying to do is get to a sustainable uh level budget this is easier for strategic planning it's easier for um for Congress to understand what we're doing moving forward in terms of a sustainable budget that we can manage so this is again this is aspirational given the current environment current budget constraints right now but we are looking um you know we're working on technology development now and then we're looking at um possible you know precursor for this search for life out here in in 2030ish and then we've got a whole bunch of more work here with the Mars sample return but we might have some payloads and some low cost emissions that would come in here in the sooner in this um in this kind of this open area on this timeline and then pass forward some of the near term activities uh to achieve the the objectives for this this future plan we need to maintain the the missions that we're operating now and continue to to have that infrastructure um develop uh the sample receiving project and the facility collaborate with Issa on the exomars Rosalind Franklin mission seek low cost opportunities to address critical infrastructure needs continue investment investments in key Mission enabling Technologies including the search for life and subsurface access public private Partnerships and one I did not mention before is um we've commissioned the national academies to help us identify what is the science that the humans could best achieve for for Mars and then our Mars our Mars exploration program creature vision is to implement a sustainable portfolio of these low cost competed missions medium class missions infrastructure technology and missions of opportunity while um it all being supportive and synergistic with humans at Mars and so that is the future plan for exploring Mars together and Lindsay I think we're waiting until the till the break for questions yes that's correct thank you very much Tiffany um I I always appreciate sort of that that Future Vision I think it's great um I'm going to invite Rick and Tomo in whatever order you guys are going to be presenting to take take it from here and to tell us about uh the international Mars ice mapper right and thank you all for this opportunity to talk about this potential Mission um I'll say a few words and turn over to Tomo to say then we'll get to get into the pitch um we have been uh this is a we're this is four space agencies that are working together none of the agencies can afford this Mission at the present time by themselves and they're trying to explore a collaboration uh to do this uh Tiffany mentioned the Emily or life detection Mission um and the decadal vision going into the ice and so uh but the problem is we don't know where the ice is exactly and we'll try to make that uh clear and this mission is intended to close that Gap assuming we can find a path forward we've talked about this in multiple forms and but meepack's been the primary one but your all's Community is really an important element in this whole uh thrust if you will to access the ice and we really want uh thankful for the opportunity to come here and chat with you Tomo any other words you want to add hey uh this is Thomas speaking from jaxa uh uh to join like uh um as as he said like the text is also the one of the uh partner agencies and this is purely International uh operations missions and then look for the uh ice and also and also this is like uh this exploration mission for the future uh Mars mission the future uh human Mission but also uh we have lots of lots of uh science ingredients uh Topics in it so I'm very happy to be here thank you all right thanks Tamil and so we'll go ahead and Lindsay and share our slides yeah I believe I believe they are you you have them yeah I haven't I've got it do you all see them we do they look great all right we see your present we don't see the presenter version we see like the the main thing but we can see your slides uh let me see if I can do presenter hold on one second oh I I sit hang on one second sorry because it's a long week and I'm running I'm is that better that looks great okay great so we kind of gave an overview um uh this effort started a number of years ago actually right before the decadal came out and the Decatur was actually asking many of the same questions but the big question is what is the grand science questions that can be addressed with the power of humans and machines at Mars and something that's really worthy of the Endeavor and uh NASA internally but the other agencies did and then actually the decadal came back with a very similar answer and the answer was that search for life with access to near surface water ice is a focusing precursor uh for the ice mapping and as a focusing precursor is the ice mapping requirement and the interesting thing here is that and this is really a message that I think we could would convey which is that accessing the ice is important not only potential uh for all it's important for a lot of groups so it's important it's one of the four main areas that we know for astrobiology climatology is there in geology Are all uh enhanced dramatically by being able to drill down and seeing that time Dimension there the other thing is is that there's a strong Synergy with the human space flight in the sense of isru needs where they need significant amounts of water to produce methane which is a that along with oxygen or keep reducing the overall costs of these emissions so you start to see a really nice energy here now the equipment for drilling is different but the need to access that subsurface is they say the same uh and so um this is a highly this is where you're exploring a highly leveraged partnership I'm not going to amense words every agency has significant budget challenges um and that's part that's part of the challenge but the importance uh and that those are very real challenges but the importance of understanding this new dimension at Mars is key and so these four space actually by space agencies have been working together Tomo with Jackson you got Ozzie CSA and NASA um and then you also have the Netherlands base office most of these agencies already have combinations of Science and uh the art and their Artemis efforts um and they and the and mostly this is part part of their Moon to Mars overall strategies the mid core mission conception it's a concept right now again acknowledging the budget realities is that the ice there would be an ice mapping Orbiter that would be built by Japan building on their tremendous experience Canadian space agency would provide a synthetic aperture radar and so just a little bit of and we'll come back to this point the current radar at Mars actually um on the on the mro really was not designed to look for near surface ice it was look for designed to look for deep aquifers and it was by someone by accident that have started finding these massive near surface ice sheets which is very exciting Discovery but um the frequencies it shows essentially creates a blind spot so it makes it so in this type 0 to 10 0 to 15 meter ranges you can't really detect where the ice starts uh this Mission would also potentially have a VHF Sounder and a large Deployable reflector and then also a calm relay and it would have atmospheric sensors as well we had a measurement definition team that was a multinational team with multi discipline so it had representatives from all the affected science communities which would be astrobiology science it was really a tremendous team and we'll have a link to the report here in a moment but they basically said that in the radar concept works and that they would strongly recommend having a VHF sound or if money can be found for it as well as a high resolution imager and that's where you see these elements in this currents is a concept being studied there would additionally be a potentially a free flying small sat Orbiter with a high resolution imager and that would essentially be a successor to high rise on on mro if all the pieces can be put together to do this come up you all have thought so much about it anything you want to add here yep uh so as you see here like uh uh we are going to provide a small piggyback uh demo lender this is the uh poetry because like the Jackson has a strategic Mouse exploration program in which uh we need a small demo land for the future of big Rovers and this is just a uh of course this is not just a small demo launder for ice mapper but also the uh demo Lander would provide the isma permission like uh ground truth thing uh about the about the presence of ice in the state of the Ice uh of the uh of the landing areas thank you yeah thank you so much for adding I completely bit flipped that so thank you because that's a critical piece because it essentially um you can image that Lander and it would also have an ability to verify what was what was is being seen and promote orbit okay uh next slide let me see if I can figure out how to do this hang on one second so uh the primary purpose here and these are goals coming out of the mission concept which is to map and characterize the near surface I I'll show you some we will show you some maps in a moment uh using all our current sensors and to try to get do a best guesstimate of where the ice sheets are um and you'll see that here in a moment um and then hang on one second and then analyze the evidence of isolated subsurface structure so you not only want to understand the eyes you also want to understand what's on top of it so that as you drill down through it you have better insight into the challenges of the drilling and if you're looking at towards the eventual human operations that Tiffany alluded to you know what you're landing on and the bearing strength of the those that surface to withstand the landing loads from arriving spacecraft so that's kind of the general and then really to understand the climatological as well as the potential habitat environments on Mars better is it the a major objective okay sure why this is sorry I'm not able to challenge it there and so these are the um uh the partner agencies are looking at the study and these are the Dual reconnaissance and science objectives and so water ice is a is Major focus and it's again it's if you in the U.S decadal and it's really mirrored at all the partner sites uh this access to ice so they envisioned the in the U.S decadal for example they assumed a mapping a mission like this and then they have Emily that goes in and does a robotically controlled access of the ice followed by humans arriving hopefully within someone from the astrobiology community on the crew doing a subsurface drilling potentially coring into the ice in multiple locations to really and bring back samples that way and so understanding where that ice is when mro went with Sharad again it did not not have the ability to see in close and you really want to minimize how deep you have to go with the initial Drilling and we've seen this on the inside it's difficult and so the art becomes finding locations that are close to the surface that you can access the ice for both science and for isru and minimize how much drilling you have to do from the engineering standpoint you also want it as close to the equator as you can because for launch operations the closer you are to the equator just like on Earth is is highly preferred so you can get off of it so the art becomes finding locations that are outstanding for science but that are also as close to the equator as possible to minimize the amount of energy needed to get off the planet well so we've talked about the terrain we want to know how much regolith is on top of these deposits we don't understand how porous it is we understand the low a bearing strength of it and understand how rough the terrain is and then we also want to understand the hydrosphere in general as well as the cryosphere and and because those are all key elements going forward so anything you want to add here no at this moment okay uh we aren't standing still we've actually been take doing mapping efforts for almost five years to try to understand where the ice is we've taken the schrod data we've taken impact craters we've taken Themis data every kind of data sets and actually are just about publishing the this result which is a map of our best guess of where the ice deposits are at Mars that green line you see here is are using all these instruments and they're all giving you different views into where ice is is an estimate of the ice boundary line the white lines are a primary Imaging that you would want to do with a synthetic aperture radar once you we get one out to Mars that's the primary one but in the end you really want to image as much of the planet as possible to really understand how these ice deposits how that where they're located and how thick they are for all the reasons that all of us you know collect would make given the it's the large interest in this this kind of area tell them anything you want to add here yeah thanks okay yeah one second I'm not sure why this thing is so slow to change sorry oh hang on there it didn't go finally so these are the when you take those white lines these are the initial Imaging areas but you we would want to be Imaging as much of the planet as possible and as Tiffany alluded to one of the the choke points is the calm back to Mars one thing that's exciting about this mission is it's currently being conceptualized is a six meter dish that can blast data back to Earth so that's that's uh uh will be key for pumping data back because synthetic aperture Radars involve a lot of data and so these these things really tie together nicely uh this is coming out of the decadal but it talks about that mid latitude mapping then it talks about the robotic eye sampling in the mid 2030s and then when humans getting there you're accessing it for science which would be coring into that ice like they do in Antarctica as well as for isru purposes SRU purposes will not happen immediately that is at least in the NASA architectures they won't and that's completely understandable but it is so difficult to drill at Mars that you want to get going on understanding those deposits as soon as possible and anyway these are the references to the U.S planetary decadal there below for your reference so we um these agencies came up with a course on Admissions and I mentioned that Tiffany actually mentioned it the measurement we did have an international measurement definition team we had 147 highly qualified applications 53 were selected across the planet and they had Excel they had expertise and all the areas including astrobiology radar isru and the team composition as I noted earlier spread across planetary science and human exploration it was an amazing team and 10 countries were represented and we had diversity across gender and career stages and their report basically confirmed the core concept of the radar and it also highly recommended moving having a high resolution camera as well as a VH imager VHF radar to really help characterize this and so the agencies are actually studying those additions to see you know what it would take to do those assuming funds could be found Domo anything you want to add here no it's perfect thank you okay good um so the key Point here is MBT Science office considered they want to maximize science is the greatest possible and so these are the key areas of focus but we've pretty much talked to those any Tomo anything else you want to add here thanks that's good yep and then here is a QR code to actually the report we strongly welcome uh welcome you to go look at it and even uh we would love to get feedback too um uh and then uh so that is I think you'll find that to be a really tremendous report and anyway Lindsay that's pretty much a quick overview I will turn it back over to Tomo to see if he thinks I missed anything and then we're delighted to try to answer questions but again this is really a incredibly fascinating Synergy synergistic Mission if the funds can be found um that would come by and ask astrobiology Theology climatology and prep the way for you real what many of us feel would be incredibly exciting uh Mission a mission for when Crews arrive there anyway tell me anything else that you think I missed no the perfect but like uh please please go to the MDG reports like you can just Google it like uh uh MDT report is like uh we have a very nice like uh uh report so yeah please check it and I would I might add one thing the technology of this kind of a mission is challenging but what's really fascinating is that there are incredible agencies across the planet that working together can make things happen and and it's just it's a pleasure been working with Tomo and his entire team and as well as everybody it's really very forward looking everyone's trying to figure out a way to make something really cool happen so thank you all very much thank you Rick and and to and tiffle for their great presentations um I think we've got time for questions and I think I think you guys actually got us right back on time so thank you very much much appreciated uh always always uh on time and under budget right uh thank you very much for that um let's do a couple questions now um in fact uh Daniela if possible do I think there were a couple questions about uh Mars related things so let's start with those and then if we have time we can go back to some of the questions um that were they're more related to some of the earlier presentations sounds good okay a couple of questions in the chat while you all are here one did I miss the depth of the mapping that you're aiming for is this just near surface or are you looking for map looking to map some sufficient depth yeah so I can start that and see what tomo has to add um you know we're really trying to close a 0 to 10 meter range now the synthetic aperture radar uh can you know depending on the conditions you know you you may not get down that low that's one of the reasons why the abhf Sounder was also recommended to help us better characterize these deposits but again we're trying to close that Loop because it's so hard to drill there you want to minimize how deep you go and if you can get the zero to ten meters you probably are going to find some amazingly interesting science sites as well as isru capabilities and you don't have to do the whole planet for that you just have to really find some outstanding sites and and that's probably and I think that's Victory given the frequencies that are available to us Domo anything you want to add to that yeah the as he said like uh we call it accessible ice the accessible by the human exploration and uh start with like a very limited uh exploration Zone but hopefully we're gonna try to map out uh the globally uh if the uh the spacecraft uh Will Survive so thanks okay great another one um is how do members of the community get to engage with the search for life sag asking as a big supporter of Mars life in Explorer Tiffany do you want to take this one no I would love it if you would take this one please sure sure um so that's actually something that we're we're looking to spin up soon um that you know we we have uh you know some folks at the Mars program office and some astrobiology folks that are actually working together um on this to to pull this together and so um that's that's another uh preview of Coming Attractions another uh watch this space um I am 100 certain that once that you know that once the once we have a tour in place and you know the open for applications that kind of thing uh that we will uh advertise that through the astrobiology newsletter um so the same way you found out about coming to this town hall today um is the same way you'll find out about how to participate in that sag thanks Lindsay okay here's more of a philosophical one for you if there are Martian microbial communities which steps could we take so that humans don't interfere ecologically oh that's a that's a good question um I will I will start a quick answer to it and then invite you know anybody else anybody from who's on this call at this time to sort of to Peak to to answer a bit you know I'd say that the way that we the first step is the is to answer the if question right um and and to start you know the exploration things like Mars sample return um things like the search for Life sag those types of you know search for life mission those types of things are really helping us to uh think about what that what life would be like and how would we would um understand what it was like and how we could make sure that you know keep biosphere separated of course I'll also note that you know the whole idea of uh the way we approach planetary protection for a lot of our missions um is to is to assume that that's the case um and treat our missions uh in such in that way such that we make sure that you know that we are not inadvertently doing that before we recognize um that there is some uh that there is life on some planet but you know I'd like to I'd like to encourage other folks uh to answer this question we also have you know uh we have some Mars experts here but we also have some uh more philosophical space exploration people so um who wants to to take it next I'll I'll start if that's all right [Music] documents they have a knowledge get a new release I think that just came out this year earlier this year for um human missions to Mars and it does assume that MSR samples have been brought back and that those have been assessed but they do maintain a knowledge Gap document they talk about the the things that we need to do before we go um you know to Mars and explore these areas so I I encourage folks to go out and look at that that knowledge gaps document yeah this is record I'll just add a few points to that Lindsay and Tiffany have done a great job I would just add that one we do this in Antarctica we look for extremophiles in drilling and so you know we should be trying to leverage those lessons absolutely as much as possible you know some of the mitigations as you know you control your operations downwind not up when you know as an example and then um and there are a lot of things that are doing there and so we need to leverage those Lessons Learned the human space flight systems I spent probably 25 years doing that stuff it's not going to be clean so that's just calling a spade a spade but doesn't mean that we can't do civilization changing science by doing that we just have to figure out a strategy that works across all the communities and the third thing I would say is rather than frame it as a problem and your question really didn't do that but some people do you know ask the question how can humans accelerate the search for life in a safe way because that is um that's that's probably the reality and we might as well embrace it and figure out how we accelerate that this amazing search for life anyone else Linda or David wanna want to say anything else about this one as well okay I think the answers you've all given so far are really good I would just like to acknowledge that it's a good question that this is a challenge for us because the most interesting places to go on Mars are also the potentially the places where we're at most risk of of you know interacting with something interesting that we don't want to harm so it's something that we take very seriously and um you know that there's a lot of thought it goes into this and as Rick said um that you know we do have some experience and environments on Earth trying to sort of do safe exploration in this way and we're going to apply all those lessons to Mars and um uh yeah so we appreciate the question and it's it's something that we really do take seriously yeah and um just to add uh you can access NASA's planetary protection policy documents online um and um I'll post a link in chat to an announcement from almost exactly a year ago about the NASA release of a new planetary protection standard and as Tiffany mentioned uh Coast fire and NASA make sure that their policies are parallel so we're all working from the same page so I'll post that link in a second thanks Linda I just wanted to add too relative to what we were talking about before with respect to field work you know and just having everyone involved in the search for Life their their responsibilities in mind that you know anything we would we would find out there has rights and we have responsibilities to protect it okay I'll go back next next question let's see okay this is a little bit specific are there any updates on the Rio Tinto analog site for current asset environment astrobiology research that's a good question um I would say you know I know that we we continue it is it continues to be an active site astrobiologically um they I'm going to highlight it too because there may be some folks um on on the chat who can actually respond to it and and you know reach out to this individual um or that they could reach out to and really uh start some Communications and some conversations but just broadly you know it is it is an important site for astrobiology and um it's one that we continue to to study anyone else have other answers other comments okay thanks Daniela next okay would NASA use energy based radiation shielding for human travel or material defenses from cosmic rays David I think this one is for you um um energy based radiation shielding um I have to confess I'm not exactly sure um what you mean but um but the there is of course a huge interest in um uh how we [Music] um how life is affected and protected affected by and protected from ionizing radiation that overlaps several of our Enterprises it's it's obviously a fundamental question for astrobiology uh in terms of um uh limits of habitability um and it's also it's a really important question for for human exploration uh in terms of safety of future astronauts uh say on Mars and in in trans yeah this is in deep space and it's one of the areas where um we um well I mentioned at the beginning I'm sort of exploring areas of overlap between some of the um science Mission um uh some of the some of the divisions in science Mission directorate and this is an area I've already had some conversations with uh biological and physical sciences um because they are um very interested in in these questions of different kinds of radiation shielding and radiation limits and tolerances uh for for this astronaut um safety question and and we as astrobiologists are interested in it uh just a sort of a fundamental of limits of Life question so so it's uh something that we um will continue to look at and I think Foster knew um uh cross divisional um research projects on and if if anybody who has you know new and good ideas about this uh we're we're all ears we want to we want to know about it yeah and this is Rick I might just add one thing real fast so it is a tool set for protecting humans uh creating a magnetic field because that's basically what the what the uh magnetic fields around the Earth are they're essentially deflectors and you can do that around spacecraft you can potentially do that on the ground I imagine the other tricks in the trade is you wrap water around them because water is a really good attenuator so you store all your water where the crew's sleeping for example um and then the third one is there's certain materials dense materials like leads that are very good for attenuating other types of radiation and in the end it's unless you have a solar flare it's it's an aggregate um total dosage that you worry about and there are lots of really clever tricks that we can do to reduce that total level down so that it's manageable one idea is even a I think it's a Norwegian architect had is it just had the crew when they're on Mars sleep underground and then stay up above ground during the day and you're reducing that Rim exposure down because it's a lifetime exposure so there's a lot of ideas and but the one you're asking about is is definitely one that's in the in the bag of tools if you will thanks fantastic Daniella okay one more question and then I think we can uh wrap it up for the for the day wonderful okay can you shed some light on the role of artificial intelligence and or machine learning in NASA missions um I'll start I can start um and see what others have to add so I come out of the Aerospace world and there is a real hesitation to use dense chips for understandable reasons because you can get single event upsets that completely tank the computer and we have them occur all the time in spacecraft the new commercial entrants have been doing some very interesting and informative things of having multiple modern people well let me back it up for us we tend to use older computers where we understand the risk to radiation the newer companies are doing using modern computers but they just bring up five of them and if one of them dies they can see that it's dyed and the other four take over and that way they're able to stay with state of the art uh computers we need I personally believe we need to really build on that knowledge and because the artificial intelligence systems are going to even denser computers in terms of chips and so that will be a transition but when you're talking about Mars the time delays almost force you to have a artificial intelligence Aid there to help facilitate the interaction between the flight control teams and the either the robots or the humans and the robots there in fact the artificial intelligence will probably be there and so I it's a really rich Frontier in terms of the opportunities we can enable for both our robotic missions and our humans and robotic missions going forward I believe and we're going to need a lot of ideas as the message I would share with that and that's at least some ideas on that I'm happy to help you in terms of economy versus AI versus machine learning generative AI is is I think what a lot of people mean when they say I but um also people mean autonomy and we are all about autonomy uh terrain relative navigation is how we landed perseverance on Mars um machine learning has been used utilized for data analysis in terms of crater mapping of both the Mars and moon and other areas so those are areas we definitely um encourage uh AI machine learning or autonomy in terms of generative AI uh you know chat GPT and and things along that those lines I think you know we're still learning still trying to understand how we can utilize it but it is not you know part of our current uh Baseline for technology development yeah just to add I completely agree with Tiffany that I was actually referring to the latter one by having sat on flight control teams for years I will tell you we're not going to have flight control teams for human mission business Mars are going to be Flight Support teams and that means you're going to need to be exploring that Frontier a lot to really understand and I believe it can be I personally believe it can be used for robotic missions and the flight control teams that can be used there too but we have to learn how to do that thank you both all everyone who spoke today who contributed who gave presentations who answered questions um I will say I understand there was one question or one couple couple different questions in the chat that were about specifics about uh some of our research programs from some of the earlier presentations I'm just going to reiterate um you can find the contact for those people the program contact at the ends of the calls and I encourage you to reach out to them reach out to folks that talked here today David has been very open about asking for people to reach out to him I of course I'm always interested in hearing feedback from folks I'm going to say you know Rick and Tiffany and Tomo agree and are interested in hearing from you all um so I will just wrap us up I will finish us off by saying um thank you all who presented and chatted and answered questions today thank you all who attended for coming and listening um and you know we hope to do this again to talk about different astrobiological topics to hear from maybe some different missions that type of going forward so thank you all have a great uh Friday the rest of your weekend this recording will be available a lot of the links that we mentioned we're going to try and put on the program website so have a great one and uh this is the astrobiology program Town Hall signing off [Music] [Music] thank you [Music]
