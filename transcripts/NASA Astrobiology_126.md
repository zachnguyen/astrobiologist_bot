this is from user kzn on YouTube they say they are a protein biophysics researcher interested in astrobiology and wanting to know how to combine the two but not knowing where to start and what advice we might offer I think I'll start off that by doing research in in the physics and the biology of proteins you are doing astrobiology already maybe you weren't aware of it but astrobiology isn't a discipline astrobiology is a field that includes many disciplines it includes chemistry physics biology geology oceanography atmospheric chemistry philosophy cultural studies sociology all of these various Realms of learning from a human study have come together to help us understand how life might begin where life might be out there The evolutionary trajectories of life and what the future of life might be and how we search for other life there's so much that we're learning with all these studies together so I would argue that you you actually are already doing astrobiology if you don't know it
