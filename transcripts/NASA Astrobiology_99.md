[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a [Music] greetings friends fellow earthlings and explorers of all ages welcome to ask and astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life as always I'm your host Dr Graham the cosmobiology Lao and we are brought to you by segan net.org and the NASA astrobiology program now we've been doing this show for quite some time and we always love every month to point out those of you out there institutions people profiles and social media all kinds of things where you're sharing about our show you're engaging with our guests you're talking about astrobiology you're asking questions about astrobiology and what we know about life in the universe this month we want to give a special shout out to the Arizona astrobiology Center on X that's a astrobiology thank you so much for sharing about our show and our awesome guest we have joining me here shortly on this month's episode for all of you out there if you share about our show we might give you a shout out and I might just be saying your name uh next month or in some month coming up here on the show so please as always thank you so much for sharing about our show we really appreciate it now today's episode is going to feature a conversation that's going to take us through a range of topics from the inner solar system to the outer solar system from dinosaurs in our ancient past to exoplanet that's very very far away joining me today we have Dr Jessica noviello a post doctoral management program fellow at NASA's Godard space flight center uh Jessica's research career has included studies in a variety of topics so many it's actually kind of hard to think about for me uh she's done work in a mission concept for Venus on asteroids like iawa uh moons surface features on moons like Europa and Pluto's Moon Sharon uh studies of dwarf planets like Hala and even research on the detection of potential bio signatures signs of potential life on exoplanets from so far away so we have a lot of fun things to discuss and we also want to answer your questions as well so for those watching live please ask your questions in the chat but first I have the chance to chat myself so Dr Jessica novello thank you so much for joining me for ask an astrobiologist oh thank you for having me Graham this is so much fun to be here hi everyone yeah I'm so excited to have you on the show uh we've been thinking of for a while of having you on and honestly I I will admit I knew of some of the things that you've done I didn't know how many different things You' you studied uh and so we have a lot of stuff to talk about we have asteroids uh Pluto and Sharon Venus a bunch of stuff to talk about but before we get there with all of our guests we have on the show we really like to know what what got you started in science in astrobiology in planetary science what was that first thing that grabbed you and made you want to pursue a career in this direction oh that's such a question and and I have what I consider an atypical kind of origin story then because I wasn't a kid who grew up looking through telescopes and and wondering about the stars and the night sky I grew up with my eyes very firmly planted to the ground and when I say that I mean I was really interested in dinosaurs from a very young age and I I think a lot of kids they go either space or dinosaurs and I I very clearly went into the dinosa dinosaurs route so I was really obsessed with Dinosaurs I loved everything about them I loved wondering what they looked like what they ate how they interacted with each other what their environments were like anything dinosaur related yeah that was I was very much known for that and and even today people are like oh yeah Jessica she likes dinosaurs in space so it wasn't until my junior year of high school when I was looking for a non fiction book to read for a summer reading assignment and I came across a book that had that talked in detail about the asteroid hitting the Earth at the end of the Cretaceous Period so the kpg extinction event that we know it today and I loved dinosaurs but here was this thing that was destroying the non avian dinosaurs and oh that's really interesting what is it about this asteroid or any asteroid that that makes it I I don't know I was I was really intrigued by this thing that was more powerful than the dinosaurs you know what what is it about them so I started getting more into that and then started looking into uh when I got to college and I was a double major in physics and Earth and planetary sciences and I specifically started taking planetary science classes which I hadn't known was a field but it makes sense like who are the people who study the rocks in space Oh yes they are planetary Sciences but I again too much dinosaurs or or maybe not enough dinosaurs I don't know we could be the judge of that later so started taking all these planetary science classes learned about potentially hazardous asteroids which are still potential threats to our own Survival and just got into planetary got into planetary Sciences from from that perspective I love that so much you know there's this thing that you love as a child and then you find out something destroyed it and so you want to know no more that's pretty cool and you know really I mean the study you know of of the history of US studying asteroids and planetary impacts is truly intriguing you know from the the Alvarez paper from 1980 you know through all of our studies to discovering the chickaloo crater the impact crater to you know even current research we're still learning more about what led to the demise of the dinosaurs and the end Cretaceous Era um and so it's pretty cool that that that's kind of your intro and I think you're right for a lot of kids it's it's dinosaurs and space like those are two super intriguing things a lot of us in astrobiology we kind of get to do both in some ways we study life and we study space and so that's kind of fun um so before we kind of get into some of the more current research you're working on your your research pathway has taken you through a lot of different studies like I mentioned in our intro from the inner solar system the outer solar system and beyond um I want to start off with asteroid iawa and some of the work that you've done uh on iawa and and what your research has been on this very intriguing asteroid I love you takawa it was the first planetary science body that I ever studied so it it holds a very special place in my heart as as this is where I began effectively so I was an intern at the Applied Physics laboratory up in Laurel Maryland and I had wonderful advisers who I feel like kind of took a chance on me because I was still not really sure what I was what I was doing um but I guess that's true of many interns right we all start somewhere and these mentors were Olivia barwin and Carolyn Ernst fantastic people and they had me work with them for a summer and my job Onawa was to count rocks I kid you not but it was uh we used a tool that had actually been developed by software engineers at at APL and it's it was a fascinating tool so okay I I should describe what iawa looks like because it's not a spherical Rocky body it doesn't look anything like ryugu where the Hayabusa 2 spacecraft went to it doesn't look anything like benu where the Osiris Rex spacecraft went to it uh depending on who you ask it if you are a Japanese space scientist you say it looks like an otter but I think it looks more like a manate but eoa actually looks like there's a head and then there's a an oval body and they're stuck together and that's actually how we refer to the different parts of idawa as the head and the body so uh it does rotate upside down or what we might look at upside down so I guess it is more like an otter but but I you know what otter are very cute too so so uh I was looking at all of the blocks on on this asteroid and by blocks I I do mean rocks and uh but they range in so many different sizes on Earth we have many different names for rocks we have Pebbles we have down to sand we have Boulders but Ona we just generically called them blocks and the point of doing this and doing this for different areas of iawa is we were trying to figure out how the surface has changed over iawa history so over time rocks or blocks on an asteroid surface due to Thermal uh just just thermal stresses and different microm meteorite impalements and and bombardment the rocks will start to break down into what we call regolith which is kind of like dirt on earth except it doesn't have organic components like we would have in soil here on Earth and on ioa because it's so small it's only about 500 meters long so may I think that would be something like 1.6 football fields if I had to do a very quick conversion in my head but it's it's not a very big asteroid and its gravity is is very small and even so the pieces of these rocks that are breaking off they are migrating down to these points of lower elevation where the gravity is relatively strong so we have these low points we have these high points and we were looking at the blocks in these different areas to figure out to figure out using some math about how the surface is change has changed over time so uh that was that was my very first planetary science project was was eawa surface Evolution that's very cool now I will say I've always heard it looks like BBH the robot from Star Wars um oh oh but I was doing this work in like 2013 so BBA hadn't been invented yet Fair okay that's awesome um yeah I was walking with my four year old child uh at a local Lake recently and trying to talk about the difference of sizes of Pebbles and and boulders and things like that and I held one up I'm like is this a pebble he's like that's a stone daddy so maybe we're not quite there yet um but then we as humans are still learning a lot more about these different kinds of rocks through the evolution of the surfaces of asterid roids like eawa and more um now like I said there's a bunch of topics to cover and so I do want to jump around a little bit here I'd love to hear about this concept mission that you were working on related to Venus um I I love Venus I always tell people that if there was any other world in our early solar system that likely had life it seems like it would have been Venus if anything uh can you explain more about the mission that you were involved with this concept design you were involved in of course so this was a part uh this was a mission that I designed as a part of the J PL that's jet propulsion laboratory planetary science summer school and uh I did it in the year 2020 which as we all know is not like any other year in um that we can remember so we we were doing a lot of things for the first time doing them differently and this group of 18 of us 18 of us postdocs and and grad students we got together and we were told okay you have 10 weeks basically to work on this Mission concept and we got training from JPL um people and Engineers along the way we had some fantastic mentors who showed us step by step this is what you need to do to build a NASA Mission and there were lots of things that we learned about like the science traceability Matrix which every mission is governed by a science traceability Matrix which is the nitty gritty of how you get from the big picture science goals of where is life in the solar system getting down to exactly what measurements in what range you're going to take and with what instruments so it's it's critical for a mission to have this and that was just one of many things that we learned the mission concept that we decided on as a group and then built as a group we went to Venus and this mission is so cool it's called it was called Valentine which is the Venus air and land Explorer novel Trailblazer for insitu exploration so it's quite a long acronym but uh the whole point of this mission that was so different we weighed doing an Orbiter Mission which wouldn't get anywhere near the clouds and we weighed doing a Lander Mission which would land on the surface but wouldn't last very long under Venus's pressure and temperature conditions and we said well why don't we just hang out in the clouds so we have this aerobot Mission which is basically a giant balloon that just passively floats through the clouds and it takes dips of I think we how many did we have I think we had something like five dips five or six dips uh between 55 and 45 kilm and just trying to get beneath different Windows get different profiles of the clouds and different latitudes and longitude on Venus and hopefully get at questions like when did Venus's oceans disappear which we would which we could understand if we knew more about different uh isotopic ratios in in the Clouds of Venus so that was one of many topics we wanted to discuss so um I loved the Valentine time Mission it was such a fun experience working with that team and and everybody who was on it so uh much love to Venus I love it so much yeah Venus is one of my favorites of the solar system of course though this is ask an astrobiologist an astrobiology show we have to talk about another major uh friendly or or or fan place for astrobiology which is Europa uh you've also done some work on studying the features in the surface of Europa um I wonder if you can speak about your own research there uh and the importance of understanding ing the surface of Europa especially sure so that was actually my entire PhD dissertation was was on Europa and europa's uh history but I was specifically looking at the what I called micro features these are small scale features on Europa surface when I say small scale I still mean like 10 kilometers in diameter but I didn't want to go for the massive chaos features that so many people had studied before and when oh here's a fun technical term so when I say icy chaos for anybody who hasn't heard that term before it's a feature specific to Europa and it comes in a couple of different forms so some of these places look like sandpaper and other places look like you took a a mirror and you just broke it on the ground and all the pieces rotated but they're fractured and you can see that there there's the icebergs which would be the shards of broken glass and then there might be the floor underneath it that that might have more of that sandpaper like appearance and people have looked at these features and they say wow they come in different types or morphologies they come in different sizes I wonder how they formed and this has been a big debate for for decades in europa's uh in Europa Sciences how did chaos features formed so I looked at the small scale features and when I and I mean different there's chaos included in there or micro chaos which is just like the big chaos but at smaller scales but there's also pits so depressions in the surface there are domes so the like a hill on Europa surface there are these dark splotches that don't have any kind of obvious topography and we called them spots and then there were these hybrid features that kind of looked like a dome and Chaos put together so it was maybe like a dome but it was surrounded by that sandpaper like texture that you might associate with the chaos so I looked at all of those I looked for different geospatial patterns in in this work and and that was the cool thing that I did was I brought in geospatial stuff from Earth EC tree ecology actually there was a Clark and Evans 1954 paper I cited all of the time that talked about the density of different types of trees and I just used that to study the different densities of micro features on Europa so that was part of my work and I was doing that to try to test hypotheses that model models had put forward so and these models were basically how did these features form and if they formed this way then we would expect this kind of geospatial pattern but if they formed this other way we would expect maybe a more dispersed pattern or maybe a more random pattern and I I can't say that I have solved everything because I nobody has solved everything but I I do have my favorite Theory at least that is supported by my own research oh very cool yeah I think you know a lot of us talk about Europa and its potential for maybe a biosphere in its in its deep ocean down below that icy crust but there's so much more for us to understand about the surface surface processes near surface processes and the connection of that surface down to the ocean down below and and what that connection might even look like and so exploring those features is so crucial to that um now I do want to move on a little bit more yet um while I still have my chance to talk with you alone before I open it up to our audience questions um you've done work you know in Venus and it AOW with asteroids and Europa and we've had you know guests on the show previously who've talked about these various kinds of bodies the traditional things we think about in astrobiology and solar system exploration but you've also done some work on uh the dwarf planets of our solar system which we haven't actually spoken about as much on the show so far uh in particular Howa you've done some work on and we've never talked about haa on the show before uh and so before before I ask you a question here I do want to share that we we pulled our audience online to ask them what is the most unique thing that stands out about haa right away uh and most of this comes from just like looking into like a Wikipedia article or looking online but for those who look it up they're going to notice a few things we offered some possibilities like a large size or having a subsurface ocean but it really is the peculiar shape uh this weird elongated shape of Howa that that really is kind of intriguing for people when they first learn about it um now I'd love to hear more about your own work with Hala and this unique body in our solar system the triaxial ellipsoid shape of Hala as you know the the technical term for basically it's a deflated American football so I um that's that's definitely one of the things that's very odd about Howa is how did it come to get that shape um there are so many weird things about it though it rotates incredibly quickly uh it's just over a 4 Hour rotation period period which for an object as big as Howa is is incredibly fast it's actually the largest fast or the fastest large sorry the fastest rotating large object in the solar system say that five times fast so the um it's also got a ring system it's got two moons it also is dynamically associated with many other objects at least a dozen so these are this is the first dynamical family in the in the Kyper belt ever identified and there are a few of these dynamical families in the asteroid belt but only one so far in in the Kyper belt so that's kind of interesting too and why is its surface completely covered with water ice and there's also a red spot on haa that might be Organics at least this is what people have have said that they are but it's not ever confirmed and it's really it's so small it is large but it's really far away so it's really small when we look at it through a telescope so it's it's really difficult to study Howa so we have to make a lot of allowances when we study it and when we're trying to model it and this is what my work did so we published this last year and it was a long paper it is a long paper and I'm I'm sorry for those who will read it but there are a lot of figures so it makes it a little bit easier to read but uh there are so many cool things that we discovered about Howa one is that the as homeo was growing or at least changing size its core and the size of its core and the density of its core actually drove a lot of its formation so what we proposed happened TOA in this in this work is that as the core was growing its rotation rate was changing and actually it was even faster when it when Hao was younger it was actually spinning faster and it was spinning so fast that material flew off of the ends and eventually coales to form the moons and the ring system that we know today so that is one of the the ideas that we put forward into the literature and we said hey we think we know what happened to haa so that was one cool thing that we found and we did a lot of that using a geophysical code called kushu which was uh developed by my collaborator Steve Dash and then we used a different code called code called icy dwarf which was written by uh my other collaborator mark NAU who is also here at Goddard and his geochemical simulations actually revealed that Hela was in its youth warm enough to sustain a liquid water ocean now it wasn't a very longlived ocean it was about a quarter of a billion years or about 250 million years but that's still a pretty long time that's like between now and like the end peran Extinction which is even before the dinosaurs so just bringing it all back to dinosaurs in the end and uh so that I thought was really cool is that wow haa might be a a an extinct ocean world and that's really cool because that made me think much more closely about what is it that we consider ocean worlds in our solar system and what is or isn't and do we consider things past and present where do we look for now I I want to be very clear that I'm not saying howo was inhabited I am saying that the Geo chemical modeling we have done and its size and its composition that we can tell suggest there was a subsurface liquid water ocean so I thought that was the coolest thing and then if you talk to Steve Dash uh he will probably say howo was really cool because it helped put in perspective the timeline of the outer solar system and the dynamical history there putting more constraints on things like Neptune's migration and even Triton's capture so there was a lot going on in that paper love it and that's that's kind of also a question I had then since we don't really talk about dwarf planets so more so much for for astrobiology I was curious you know how do you envision understanding the dwarf planets and kind of helping us better understand the nature of life um you know do they help us better understand like the history of formation the structure of solar systems the delivery of materials to Worlds how can we kind of you know see the the dwarf planets as being important for astrobiology studies I think for me they represent this very critical in between point of not quite a planet but not an asteroid either so they they have odd aspects of both of them and one of them especially in the Kyper belt where most of the dwarf planets are or at least the ones that we know of so far um they have a lot of Organics and a lot of water and this is just a a reflection of how this we think the solar system actually formed is things way out away from the Sun had ice and the things inside the the water uh evaporated so they are like asteroids fossils of an earlier time in solar system history but I think like planets they have a lot going on on their Interiors or at least they used to so studying they're they're a key part in in a Continuum of of how worlds grow and as worlds grow if there is a biosphere how does that biosphere respond to it so I I think just understanding where planets come from is a very fundamental step in understanding within context uh astrobiology in our solar system fantastic now before we move on um so your 2022 paper um it is long as you say but I hope that our our audience will go find the paper and read it um I also know that you wanted to mention something important about the artwork that was developed for the cover of that paper uh if you can speak to that for our audience yes I thank you for bringing that up Graham because uh there is a figure and it might be the first figure in the paper actually and it's a six panel illustration of what we of of our formation hypothesis for haa and this was developed by a woman at Arizona State University named Sue selker and I am so sorry to report that just last week Sue passed away um and she was so instrumental in doing artwork not just for my paper but for many papers that that people in the department put out over the years she was responsible for so much original artwork that is still hanging up at ASU she made sure posters got printed and got to their conferences on time she was so key for for what we did in in our department and we're really going to miss her and I just wanted to make sure that that her memory is honored because she really did so much good work yeah I love that so much and thank you for sharing that with us um you know I think it's important for people people to know that that that you know what we do in in space science in astrobiology planetary science it's not just the science and the engineering and building the missions um it's the people the people who create artwork who who help us who do Administration who do business who do all the things that are necessary for us to to do this this endeavor this process of Science of learning more about our place in the universe and so I'm so glad that she was involved in your own career and and in developing artwork to help better our knowledge of Space Science across the board um now we're going to move on just a little bit more here before I open up the audience questions and we do our faster than light segment uh there's just so many cool things that you've worked on I can't help but ask about a whole bunch of different things uh now more recently you've been doing more work on exoplanets uh specifically looking for Bio signatures on exoplanets or potential bio signatures uh what kinds of signs of Life specifically are you interested in uh finding or looking for on world around other stars once again my answer is going to come back to dinosaurs so now dinosaurs and exoplanets where the heck is that overlap uh it comes down to well I was oh this is this is I I wonder if I should bring this up now oh so um I when I was a grad student in Arizona I got very involved with a paleontology group and this group actively goes out on on digs to different parts of the South West and and I still get to do that even though I I live out in Maryland now I just make a special trip once a year to to go out on this dig and I was just thinking like wow I wonder if like what is the connection then like why why does my brain work this way to what what am I missing like I I don't know I I love to build connections and bridges so I was thinking oh there has to be something here and I was talking to one of the paleontologists on on a dig once about mass extinctions because how I got started in planetary science I just thought it was really cool and and he was wondering you know why is a NASA scientist doing a dinosaur dig so so we talked about mass extinctions and then I started thinking well if mass extinctions of which we know five at least five in the fossil record here on Earth well maybe mass extinctions are a part of life maybe if there's life elsewhere in the universe maybe they are also experiencing mass extinction events and if they are what might that look like in an exoplanet's atmosphere how does how did Earth's atmosphere respond to the level of of biomass decaying at the end of something like the kpg extinction event or at the end Permian Extinction event and are these signals detectable and since they're they're more like signals of death than signals of Life we've been um in our research group calling them the necro signatures so uh I'm I'm really exced to see where this work goes this is very much still in its early phases although I have presented on this work at at conferences and I have a couple of abstracts out on it now but this I I feel like there's something here and again coming with the mind of somebody who has a space and a dinosaurs background I I feel like this is a problem that is really intriguing but also kind of made for for me to tackle so I'm really excited to see where this goes and maybe it doesn't go anywhere but you know at least I tried yeah and it's still a very intriguing idea we often think about possible signs of Life on exoplanets and people think about you know like here on Earth like photosynthesis production of o2 O2 being in an atmosphere with things like methane and other molecules uh we've had guests on the show talking about potential technos signatures like signs of industrial activity on exoplanets but we haven't really talked about the potential potential for mass extinction and large scale decay of biological material on a world and what that might look like so it's really intriguing research I'm excited to read more about it when you do publish and put more out there for us to explore uh maybe in the near future we'll have you back on the show to talk about maybe a potential discovery of a necro signature um now I do want to move in a little bit more to a few other things before we open it up to our audience um first off you mentioned earlier that you've done an internship you were part of this planetary summer school at JPL um you've been involved in you know various Realms of your own career kind of exploring options of what someone can do in their career and we really want to point out that you've Dev veloped this thing called pause or the professional advancement Workshop series uh where you've been kind of leading these seminars for helping people not just learn about you know what what is the action of becoming a planetary scientist or an astrobiologist but you know how do we develop our careers once we're here uh I wonder if you can speak more about the impetus for developing this Workshop series and what it's meant for you and and bringing this to others I would love to thank you for letting me speak on that so pause was inspired very much by uh my own frustration and I was it was 2021 I had Fairly recently started as a postdoc at Godard and I was already thinking about okay what do I do after this because any academic will know you always have to look like three years ahead to to figure out what your next step is going to be and I was sitting in my room just thinking that I I don't know what else is out there and we had always joked or at least my friends and I had always joked like oh if Academia doesn't work out we're going to go into industry you know we'll do data science it's it's fine I already have that skill set but but do we like what is that skill set and if we're lacking things how do we get from A to B and what what do we need to do now to prepare for that down the road so I didn't know the answers to these questions I didn't know what else was out there I had a PhD but what did that mean so I figured to myself if I was asking these questions then maybe other people are asking these questions and maybe this is something that the community can come together on and maybe we can learn together so I pitched an idea that eventually became pause I first pitched it to my advisor Shan Dole Goldman who then told me to contact Melissa kin Brooks who then brought it up with Mary vyek the then head of astrobiology and we did get some funding just so that we could bring in outside speakers so I mean the point is if we're looking for careers that aren't just NASA researcher then we need to look to people who are outside of NASA and to do that a lot of times you do need money so you can pay people for their time so we had some seed funding and we were told you know do this for for six months and and we'll see how it goes and we've been doing that was August 2021 when we started so now we're more than two years past it pause is now a community of 500 mostly early career scientists but also some senior scientists who are just interested in in the kind of of work and what kinds of options are out there so we've talked about all kinds of things like data science of course uh we've talked about jobs in NASA management we've talked about jobs in uh even video game design and what that might look like for somebody who's a scientist to move into into video games so we most of our our work is recorded and there is actually a website where anybody who's interested in learning more about pause you can go and you can look and you can watch most again of of most of our videos of our recordings from our pause events that's awesome and I I'll share that website right now uh it's nexus. infopaw it's neex ss. info PWS for those who want to look it up learn more about it uh and maybe learn more about professional development for those of us kind of in the realm of astrobiology but also in planetary science space science other Realms as well and say for myself uh having decided not to pursue the traditional academic pathway there is a lot I had to learn along the way and a lot of it was teaching myself a lot of skills that I was never taught otherwise and so it's important I think for us to kind of have those experiences to learn about ways of of finding new career Ventures for ourselves oftentimes I've heard people lament they're going to quit their career and open a bakery and I'm like do you know how hard it is to run a bakery that's actually a lot of work and if you don't know how to bake something to start with maybe that's not the career choice you want to make just yet um but there's a lot of options out there for careers I know a lot of people watching our show are interested in career paths in astrobiology and so it's great to know that there's there's not just one single track there's lots of different directions our careers can take uh now besides just giving back in this realm of career advancement I if I could just say like one more important thing is is is that one of the things that I wanted to do when I created pause is is to focus on developing transferable skills because people can love science but they reach a point in their job where they say this isn't working for me anymore so I did want to make sure like you said that there's there's flexibility in what people can do that still keeps them in science because we I firmly believe that everybody belongs in science if you want to be here there is a spot for you the trick is finding where that spot is that makes you also feel fulfilled and complete so that I I focus on that when I'm trying to put together the next event and hopefully this is not the end um and we'll just keep going awesome I love that so much and hopefully there will be a continuation of it for many many years to come for others who need to learn these skills now before we go to our fast than light segment um a couple more things I do want to point out that you and I uh in the the not too distant past uh did a twitch stream together on our friend Monica vidar's uh twitch channel uh astr Trava um where we talked about planetary science while she played a game which was kind of fun um as those who know me know I've done a lot of community engagement and trying to share the science of astrobiology uh in various channels in various ways you've done a bunch of work in this realm yourself uh I wonder if you can share with us kind of your vision of why it's so important to do things like Community engagement to share our knowledge of science uh through various channels like video games and and other things like that I think it comes back to my core belief that that everybody has a place in science and even if it's just as somebody who is an a very enthusiastic Observer who's like you know what yeah like I'm more uh I I don't want to do the science but I want to support the people who are doing the science and and I also feel as somebody we we often hear this like oh you're you're tax dollars support science and and it's something that I keep in the back of my head of like this is me giving back to the entire American community of of trying to explain what I do and why it's important and why it matters to keep funding this kind of work and so I'm I'm not going to get on that soap box but I I feel like I'm just paying back a lot of of what has been has been given to me and plus it's just a lot of fun to do things like twitch streams and to to put out Instagram posts with beautiful visuals and and people like to hear about it and people like to know more about it we're all wondering what else is out there and and I get to be somebody who can answer you know maybe like one 1,000th of that question but but I can still help and and if I can help people engage more with science and be a little more full of wonder in their own lives then I'm going to I'm going to try and do it fantastic yeah I love that so much uh I do have to move the show along I noticed that we are running have time for all of our our uh viewers to ask their questions but before we get there we're going to have our faster than light segment uh these are just some very fun short questions we ask of all of our guests um to kind of have an idea of different astrobiologists and kind of their view of some of these topics the very first one comes from enrio ferm's famous question of where are they where why aren't there aliens here right now if faster than light travel is possible why aren't there aliens here right now so what is your favorite answer to ferm's question where are they oh I think they're out there and they are probably wondering the same thing as we are and where are they I don't know if I can point to a planet and say like oh they're on trapist onee like it's not going to be as precise as that but I I think the the coolest things that we're going to find are probably in the deepest parts of our ocean and extremophile organisms um that are maybe bubbling away in in Yellowstone Lakes like again those are not aliens but they're going to be alien like and where are they they are I don't know if this is quite an answer but they are out there and they are wondering the same about us groovy um I love it uh so one thing that I you know I've noticed in hosting this show over the years is that all of us in the realm of astrobiology have been inspired by some kinds of stories from books comic books movies television shows video games for some of us um so what stories have inspired you to want to learn more about life in the universe the kpg extinction event no I remember like as a kid I was watching the the BBC documentary of uh Walking with Dinosaurs and that really kicked off my love for for dinosaurs which opened my love for science so I feel like in my mind it always starts there and then of course I've already explained how it got to um how I started learning about asteroids that way and it's just opened up everything else so uh I remember doing bad Science movie Nights with my friends in grad school we did watch a couple of space movies like we did Europa Report and you know what it was it was fun to be in a room full of scientists while watching that movie I think I'll say that love it yeah I mean I've watched a lot of fun movies that are known for their their lacking science like the core and others that it's just fun to watch um and to explore those ideas and what's right and what's wrong in some of those films um now you know having developed pause you spoken a lot with people about Career Development career advancement um different ways to build and develop your career but if you could go back in time to the beginning of your career and give yourself advice what would you say I'd say the same thing I should tell myself more now is that you know what you're doing and you can trust yourself and just believe believe that you know what's going on and and speak your mind and remember that you you too are the expert and you can you can speak up so yeah just trust yourself and for everybody out there you know trust yourself yeah I love that um so you you have the expertise to be a very good person to answer this next question we don't always get an answer to it because it is kind of it makes us pick a side um if there is alien life out there do you think we're first going to find it in our own solar system or on an exoplanet I I feel like I have to preface this by saying this is my opinion but I think we have a higher chance of finding it within the solar system just because it's closer uh we have more tools because it's closer we have more tools available to to study what is in our solar system more than we can study what is on an exoplanet right now um exoplanets are are plentiful they are incredibly numerous uh we have cataloged something like over 5,000 of them at this point but we will never or at least not in my lifetime we will never see the surface of an exoplanet the way that I can look at a picture of europa's surface or Mars's surface or even Pluto's surface so I think just because we have even if we have fewer data points we have better data points in our own solar system very cool my last question and it's my favorite of them all what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind this one it's so cool okay so Europa surface is incredibly young and there's a lot of we can tell that just because there aren't many crators on it and we generally use the rule of thumb like more craters equals older surface and and there is a a quantitative relationship between that so we have estimated the age of Europa surface to be between 80 and or between like 50 and 180 million years old which means that there are dinosaurs and it might even be a majority of dinosaurs of their fossils that are older than europa's surface not that they ever looked at Europa but but there are some bones that are older than Europa and that that really blows my mind of of putting all of the solar systems history into context yeah I love that it's one of those things where it's like you know space is closer to you than you are to most other people on the planet it's one of those kind of things where it's like you know if you hold a fossil of a dinosaur it get very likely older than the surface of Europa which is one of the key surfaces that we're studying for astrobiology so I love that so much uh thank you for those those answers to our faster than light segment questions we're now going to open it up with the time that we have left to audience questions that are coming in from the chat uh we do have a lot of them and so I'm going to try for everyone who's asking questions to get through them as quickly as we can um it sounds like a lot of folks have really interesting questions for you Jessica um first off is a question from Dr Jim pass um who often likes to ask questions about sociology and Humanities involved in astrobiology um he says in your status as a science Communicator how would you approach emphasizing the importance of the discovery of living ET life extant ET Life on Mars or Europa is two examples especially to those who argue that astrobiology and space exploration generally are a waste of time and money it's a two part question okay I'm gonna need 30 seconds to think about that I would say that if if scientists are going to announce the discovery of of life we need to be 100% sure that what we are looking at is actually life and and this is something that many of my colleagues are working on the the standards of evidence and and if you were to Google that I'm sure you would find that also very long paper about what how do we know that we're looking at life and it's it's is not an easy question to Define um I mean if we went to Mars and and we looked at a rock and we saw microbes crawling on it that's that's pretty definitive but um for most of my colleagues who study exoplanets that's not realistic and so I would say like first we would have to be 100% sure and then we would as a science Communicator I would still be very hesitant to say anything definitive um for the people who say that science is is a waste of of effort and time and money I I have heard that and my answer to that would be that science and the exploration that we do of space is so much bigger than just the money that we put into it it's hard to say what value inspiration has or or rallying around a science question like we see the community do and even seeing uh Nations like in the 60s when we had the Apollo program here in the United States we've really had a lot of of sentiment around that mission and that it's hard to put a value on something like a monetary value on something like that and I think there's a lot of potential to bring people together into a bigger and and work towards a bigger question and a bigger purpose and that is something that space can do like very few other things can W I love that so much I probably should have saved that for the last question that was an important answer I think for everyone um I'm gonna preface our next question by saying that um so as as Dr novel knows we have very limited uh highresolution mapping of the surface of Europa so far of of images of the surface of Europa it's going to get better with Europa Clipper but so far to our knowledge there aren't many great places for a for a nice flat Landing for instance on the surface of Europa as of right now uh there was a Europa Lander concept some time back that tried to determine like where would we land a Lander on Europa and so having the Clipper go would be very important but that leads us to this question uh from sanit demon uh sanit wants to know um based on your work on micro fractures or micro features on the surface of Europa um how what are the importance of these micro features and implications for finding a landing site for a future mission to land on Europa that's a great question so one of the things that I looked at specifically that was very critical to to the models that I was testing was the pits so they're the depression featur and one of the cool things about Pits on Europa surface is that they tend to Cluster with other pits and they also tend to be closer to other features in general like Ridgid and and this was something I was working on right um right at the beginning of 2020 so I I still have yet to go back to it but the so these features if they're clustering together then that is a pattern um a larger pattern that we might be able to see even in our low resolution imaging and you might want to avoid a place that has you know a lot of depressions because then if you land on a slant it might not fall over but it might fall over and then you don't have a Lander Mission anymore you have like a tumbling mission that might land upside down so um o what would be the best place to land on Europa that's really tough because you don't necessarily want to do it in the middle of a chaos feature especially if it has that sandpaper like texture CU I mean it looks small but they're actually quite big uh bumps and ridges I would I would really like to land near a ridge actually on your Ropo or one of the cycloid features because I think whatever formed these ridges in these features prevents other features from forming Too Close which means you there's a little bit of space on either side of of the ridge where it might be a safe place to land and then you can get probably some really interesting seismic data um so again I'm not telling NASA what to do but I would be really curious to see what it was like uh physically next to a ridge very cool um we have a question from sser pallet um sser by the way works with me at Blue Marble space Institute of science as a visiting scholar uh he's been working on the life detection knowledge base part of the center for Life detection uh he has a question regarding the upcoming venusian missions um and what you think of their potential astrobiological um or their astrobiological potential uh for helping us better understand Venus um probably including the potential rocket lab uh Mission but but also other missions that are being planned by NASA Issa Ross Cosmos and others so I think the most important thing that we can get from from any of these missions and it might just be because I'm at I'm at Godard which is running the Mission but I'm really curious what the clouds are going to reveal so that that pass that da Vinci will do right through the the atmosphere and the different Cloud layers what kinds of chemicals will it encounter what kinds of Isotopes and what does that tell us about Venus's oceans which is probably the most relevant question to its its habitability is if we figure out what happened to europ to Europa to Venus's oceans if we figure out what happened to Venus oceans and especially like how quickly uh if they existed which isn't a given but if they existed how quickly did they evaporate and is there evidence of that still contained within Venus's clouds that I think is going to open up a lot of astrobiology potential and I I think I'm most excited for that because uh there are no clouds like Venus clouds yeah absolutely like I said Venus is one of my favorites personally I think we need to know more about the ancient history of Venus and there's only a few ways for us right now to do that so those missions are are very crucial for that uh our next question is actually one of my more favorite things to think about in general in the the current structure of our own solar system uh hendrik Hol has asked if there are any known or Cloud objects to start with but then um kind of I guess maybe more your opinion on whether or not there could be an Earth siiz planet or or larger structure out there in the outer solar system that we haven't discovered yet oh is this Planet X which I mean I admit I haven't I haven't thought about Planet X in since like 2019 um so I I have to say I don't know that much about it or or even the the more updated uh ideas surrounding it so I'm I'm sorry my my answer here might be quite short but I know that the or cloud is the birthplace of comets in the solar system and so we think that many of the comments that we see probably came from there although I have to say I don't really know specifics about that either oops um you have you have found a gap in my knowledge uh so so thank you now I'm going to go and like read the Wikipedia page on the or cloud and and uh what else is out there but I mean there are there is always the potential for a great discovery yeah I just don't know where exactly it will come from and I think nobody ever does yeah absolutely we're always learning more you know I can say that that a little bit of knowledge of the or Cloud that we have these long period comets that take thousands of years to go kind of into the inner solar system back out their their their their orbits takes so long and so if we start mapping them out we start seeing this like spherical kind of Realm they may be coming from uh we have not directly observed an orc Cloud object to my knowledge um yet because it is so very far away I've heard estimates of a half a lightyear to a lightyear away um which would be extreme distant um perhaps closer but that's way further than even the Voyager spacecraft have gone um by a long shot uh I once to like a back of the envelope calculation it could be like a thousand years uh for Voyager One to even get that far out so that's quite a quite a long distance away so um but for hendrik I would highly say like you know these are the fun questions that make us think and sometimes we have some answers sometimes we don't have any um and it's worth going and exploring what we do and don't know currently maybe you'll be involved in the next generation of explorers to help us learn even more about those objects uh now our next question is related to your work on this idea of necro signatures or these potential bio signatures of the decay of mass extinctions uh ANC wants to know what the technology looks like uh in searching for these potential signatures um basically you know what would we be be using to look for potential necro necro signatures Annie that is a great question so I've been standardizing a lot of of the work that I've done so far to the different instruments that the jwst or James Webb Space Telescope has on it because that right now is the most precise telescope that we have to study exoplanets and so I want to know if there's a signal would jwst be able to detect it um so that would be like the midinfrared imager or the Mir instrument and then there's another one that does uh oh my gosh I am blanking on the name but basically there are two cameras and they do infrared Imaging pretty soon there's going to be the RO the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope which will go out and that's going to have something like a hundred times what Hubble can do in terms of of how much it can see so it's going to be incredible to get just the amount and volume of data uh that we would need to study different exoplanets and it's going to be more attuned to look for earth sized exoplanets as well so that's going to be a big Improvement as well and then uh this is one that doesn't fully exist yet right now it's called the habitable world's Observatory and when I say it doesn't exist I mean right now the planning for this Mission and exactly what it can do and what its capabilities are that is being decided right now by expert teams who have been studying exoplanets for decades who are the world's experts in IND detectability and what a bio signature even is so there's a lot of room for growth in terms of exploration of exoplanets and I still think the fundamental question of what is a bio signature is not one that has been fully answered yet awesome U very good answer we I think we have time for maybe one or two questions yet let's see how we do uh a question from the user rendering reality 3D animations on YouTube um considers the potential connections of the ice on Europa um ocean to surface um they would like to know if during your work on studying these micro features if there are any similarities within the spots that you're exploring um like the chaos to things like ice brine channels on Earth and other features too yes there are actually and and this is work that Britney Schmidt uh especially who does extensive fieldwork in ice limbs specifically studying the yops which are like these Under Ice Glacier volcanoes and what they're what the heat from the volcano does to the ice surface on top so a lot of that that field work is is directly related to europa's geomorph morphology or maybe like cry morphology I suppose would be a better term for it but but how the surface looks so I personally haven't done that and I have to say I'm really jealous because I would love to do field work in Iceland um but uh maybe one year I I will go out there so lots of different questions about how ice responds but we also have to remember that ice on Earth is very different from ice on Europa uh it's much colder out there so ice behaves more like rock out in Europa than it than it does like ice over here so the field work that we do here is great but it's it's not everything so we still have to go to Europa and we still have to to see exactly what is going on out there love it I think we have time for one more question I'm going to choose this question from Louie uh from YouTube uh Louie wants to know what advice you might give to someone in the UK and and I'll say any country really uh who dreams of working for NASA in astrobiology I actually know a lot of people who are originally from the UK I have a a couple of really good friends actually I have one friend who just began as a professor up at talson uh Allan Jackson and so he what did he do he came to the United States first as a postto and he just started writing NASA grants with people who um who were more established scientists or at least established here in the US and he's just kept doing that now for about a decade and it seems to have worked for him where he is he's just going and another way to get here would be to to pursue I I don't know what stage of your career you are Louie but if you are looking for postto there a NASA postoral program which does uh accept people from from really anywhere almost anywhere so um contact somebody at Nasa and put together a really good proposal but that I think of course if you're grad student or if you're looking for a grad student spot internships um emailing professors just try reaching out um it's really scary to cold email people when you don't know them but if if you want to know more then again just trust yourself because you know what you like and and grad school and and Science and life really is just a journey of self discovery so go for it fantastic uh thanks Louie thanks to all who are watching we love the questions you were asking I didn't get to all of them I apologize for that um if you'd like to learn more about Dr noviello and her work and maybe even find ways to ask for your own questions you can visit her website at Jessica noel. phd. uh and learn more about her there all of her current research she's studying so many different cool topics from itawa and a Venus concept Mission and exoplanets and possible necro signatures looking going out and digging for dinosaurs and all of these cool things so Jessica it's been so much fun having you on the show and and here to answer some of our questions thank you so much thank you so much for having me sorry we didn't get to all the questions yeah I mean that always happens there's so many awesome questions about astrobiology from the questions in our chat on YouTube to the questions that people will reach out and C email us with and ask us questions and I know a lot of us do try our best to answer when we can even though we are very busy so please understand that sometimes we can't answer right away um if you'd like to learn more about the Paul's uh professional advancement Workshop series again you can visit nexus. inoa that's NE xss doino P AWS uh you can learn more about Paul's there I highly recommend you check check out Dr novell's website um for those who want to learn more about things going on at NASA astrobiology like episodes of our show upcoming events things like the Paul's workshop and others uh please sign up for the newsletter uh it's the email that comes from NASA astrobiology announce is all kinds of things you can learn about and study explore with us uh through NASA astrobiology in the program uh so Dr noell thank you for joining us to our audience
