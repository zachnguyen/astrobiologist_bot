if you could go back in time and visit yourself at the very beginning of your career what advice would you give yourself it's okay if it's not easy often we look at at people in careers uh and and think that you know because of where they are that it must have been easy for them to get there it's not always easy and that's okay if something takes multiple times to get it it's you know can be really worth putting the effort in to keep trying to get there um but just because something doesn't come easily the first time you try it doesn't mean you can't do it uh and and it doesn't mean that by persevering and pushing through that you won't be able to do it even better as you move ahead
