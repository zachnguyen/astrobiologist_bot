has a question regarding the upcoming venusian missions so I think the most important thing that we can get from from any of these missions and it might just be because I'm at Goddard which is running the da Vinci Mission but I'm really curious what the clouds are going to reveal so that past that da Vinci will do right through the atmosphere and the different Cloud layers what kinds of chemicals will it encounter what kinds of Isotopes and what does that tell us about Venus's oceans which is probably the most relevant question to it's its habitability we figure out what happened to Venus's oceans and especially like if they existed how quickly did they evaporate and is there evidence of that still contained within Venus's clouds that I think is going to open up a lot of astrobiology potential and I I think I'm most excited for that because there are no clouds like Venus clouds
