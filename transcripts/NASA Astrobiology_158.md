[Music] okay so we're gonna shift gears a little bit here and so my project largely focuses on the evolution of multicellularity uh in bacteria specifically so titled here cellular differentiation within an obligate multicellular bacteria so where I like to start is just generally when we think about the evolution of life on Earth we can kind of think of it as an increase in complexity as as life continue to evolve and this is yes and over Simplicity but thinking of it as molecules coming together to form a first cell and eventually getting a multi cellular organism and then some something that looks like the life that we have on Earth today if we look at our classic uh Tree of Life where we have different domains of the bacteria the archaea and the eukaryotes generally we tend to think of all the multicellular life forms belonging to the Eukarya and we think of the bacteria and archaea as these simple single celled organisms um if we look at uh the Tree of Life as we know it today uh multicellularity actually it can be plotted across the entire uh tree of life and so what I'm showing here is the aggregative uh evolution of multicellularity or a clonal uh evolution of multicellularity and we see it present in the bacteria the archaea and the Eukarya of course and so just focusing in on some bacteria that are capable of this these are just some micrographs showing different uh cyanobacteria that are in those chains up there in the upper left and then mixo Cox mixobacteria that sporolate an archaea called methanosarcina another example is this uh bacteria called cable bacteria that form these long centimeter long filaments and can actually move electrons along that so the organism that I study is called multicellular magnetotactic bacteria or MMB for short because I just don't want to say that the whole talk and so this is what they look like where we have a tem image sewing uh where these cells are grouped together in this kind of soccer ball shape or football shape um and then here in the lower half just an sem showing you what that structure looks like so I built a cartoon kind of showing um what this Ultra structure looks like and one of the things I want to point out that pertains the name is this magnetotaxis and so they make these uh organelles inside the cells called magnetosomes where they synthesize a Paramount or ferromagnetic mineral that allows them to sense Earth's geomagnetic poles and then they can taxi in the water column or the sediment column um they also have these carbon or energy storage granules inside them this acellular Center so it's just one layer of cells surrounding this acellular Center and then these actin like filaments that seem to have some something to do with their structure and morphology um I've referred to them as obligate multicellular organisms and this is rare in bacteria in fact the only example where the hypothesized life cycle is that they grow in size and then the entire consortia divides and so we don't typically see this in uh bacteria where typically we see this this facultative multicellularity so they can be uh multicellular but they can also exist as a single cell and that's true for all the examples I showed you with the tree life so here's just an image of uh one of the MMB from my sample site and kind of what we think it looks like uh MMB dividing into possibly three I also mentioned moment of truth if the video works um that they're magnetactic oh let me see if I can get this to work no now I'm just hitting buttons Okay cool so what we have here is a uh tube with the MMB in the bottom of it and then a magnetic stir bar next to it and if you just watch it you can see them swim up out of the bottom of that tube and they taxi towards the the stir bar these ones are going towards the magnetic north here in on the right is a hanging water droplet just on a cover slip and there's a magnet uh to the right and then what I've done is just move that magnet turns around they start taxiing the in the opposite direction so that's uh just showing their magnetotaxis um it helps when we think of multicellularity to have some criteria for what that is and so just a list of these would be built from several cells of the same species a specific shape and organization and synchronized growth so that exclude things like cancer no competition between the cells coordinated behavior in response to external or internal stimuli existence of cell to cell signaling and then this last one that's kind of like the catch all metabolic differentiation or a division of labor so with my organism they fit these first four and these second the last two are what we're kind of looking into um one of the things we found with our project was that the these MMB are not actually clonal and how we did this was we sorted whole consortia's did multiple displacement amplifications so we Amplified their entire genome and sequenced that and we were able to map reads to the longest read the best assembly there and look at these single nucleotide polymorphism differences and what we found was that they have compared to controls which is a pseudomonas control as well as other environmental cosorts they have this much higher um single nucleotide polymorphism rate than than what we see with other organisms which was kind of a surprise and we're still scratching our heads about this um and that equates to 20 to 100 nucleotide polymorphisms in the genome and their genomes are about eight megabases which is about double that of E coli another thing that we looked into was this metabolic differentiation or this division of labor and this was done by doing stable isotope incubations where we incubated them in the presence of these 13c or deuterium oxide chemicals and then we use uh nanosecondary ion Mass spectroscopy to look at those and map that back where we found in the lower left whereas the 13c image differences in the use of that substrate indicating this the vision of Labor that we suspected so with that just to kind of give conclusions and takeaways um the m and b are the only known obligate multidocellular bacteria that we know of yet um they are not clonal and do not conform to these canonical ideas of what multicellular multicellularity is where we typically have this clonal development from where one cell divides into daughter cells that stick together or this aggregative multicellularity and they seem to fall somewhere in the middle there they also engage in a division of labor as we were looking at with the metabolic differentiation and then of course just to think the lab and all the collaborators that help us with that thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
