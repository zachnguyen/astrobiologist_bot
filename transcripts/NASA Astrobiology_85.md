how do you envision where we are right now with planetary defense and the future of planetary defense as a benefit for Humanity people in the planetary defense Community like to say that a devastating asteroid impact with Earth is a disaster that we can prevent as opposed to We Can't prevent hurricanes we can't prevent earthquakes we can't prevent tsunamis but we can prevent catastrophic asteroid impacts the good news is well as of now all known asteroids are not on an impact course with Earth for the next 100 years what we're working on particularly with the near Earth object surveyor Mission which will be a dedicated space based asteroid Observatory which can operate 247 right now all of our observing capabilities are groundbased and if the moon is full you can't observe if the weather's bad if the sky is full of clouds you can't observe you can only observe at night and so having that space based Observatory will be really important
