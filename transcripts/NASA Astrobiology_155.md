you've had a very prestigious career you've done so many incredible things but if you could take the knowledge you have now and go back to meet yourself at the beginning of your career what kind of advice would you give yourself what I'd give advice to younger faculty or early career scientists is you know find your colleagues your students Junior and senior to you colleagues your family find your support group and find your colleagues that you respect and trust and who trust and respect you and and hold on to those people and I think it is about the people you interact with not the institutions you go to but really who is it that you work with that you're learning from is really important
