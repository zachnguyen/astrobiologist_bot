[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a [Music] greetings friends fellow earthlings and explorers the world over and welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life I'm your host Dr Graham Lao also known online as the cosmobiology and we're brought to you by the NASA AST biology program net.org before we get to our show today as always we love thanking everyone out there who shares about our show who interacts with our guest who shares the the hashtag ask astrobio in various various social media platforms today we want to give a big thanks to CER pallet I will say sier is currently working with me at Blue Marble space Institute of science as a visiting scholar in my lab group he's working through the center for Life detection which is part of the enfold RCN that we'll talk about later uh working on the life detection knowledge base sioner has shared through his own social media channels and through others about our show so a huge thanks to sanker to everyone else who joins in for our show and watches and shares we love you all now today's episode is going to feature a friend and a colleague of mine who has had a remarkable Journey as a scientist and a communicator of science joining us today from NASA's Jeet propan laboratory is Dr Bonnie T her research is focused on improving the reliability of organic bios signature detections and researching how to tell if something is a sign of life in ancient rocks she's originally from Australia which we'll talk about a good bit during this episode where she did her PhD in geology and astrobiology at the University of New South Wales she loves to do work in the field and spend a lot of time out in the bush in the desert and at Sea thinking about life detection here on Earth and out there in the cosmos one of her greatest passions is improving equity in geoscience and she's worked with this topic in schools and museums Departments of Education University settings she's done a lot as a science Communicator as well as being a researcher she's also the early career co lead for NASA's Network for Life detection and fold uh as well as being the co lead for the Geological Society of Australia's education and Outreach special interest group she's currently a postdoc fellow at NASA JPL in the origins and habitability Laboratory where she researches life uh and life detection in hydrothermal systems so thank you so much for joining us and welcome to the show Bonnie thank you so much grae I'm so excited to be here yeah I'm so excited to have you on the show finally we've talked several times about bringing you on to talk about your research your current work your work in science communication your work with enfold and and other Realms but as always I love starting off our episodes asking our guests to share a bit about their personal journey into to what brought them to where they are now and I know that you actually have a very remarkable story for your your transition through life into becoming a scientist and a researcher JPL uh would you mind sharing that with our audience yeah sure um so I guess when I was growing up I didn't really know anyone who had a University degree except teachers at school um and I never imagined that science could be for someone like me I actually dropped out of high school um and worked full time at McDonald's while I did my uh GED equivalent at um a sort of vocational College in Australia called T and then um I didn't do any science at all in t um and I was always thinking about uh you know working with books and doing English literature and so when I finished my high school equivalent I applied to University and I got rejected from every University I applied to and so I ended up doing something called a bridging course which is an option for many students and the type of course I did was specifically for disadvantage students and so it showed us how we could learn to be at Uni so not only did I not finish high school but nobody in my immediate family finished high school either and so my family was incredibly supportive of me getting education but we just didn't have the tools to prepare me to be able to get that education and so in the bridging course they actually t taught me like what I should do to be able to study to think critically to evaluate texts um and I ended up finishing that in half the amount of time I was supposed to um because of academic Excellence it's funny what happens when a student actually gets the support they need um and I started my undergraduate degree studying English literature and I was at MCC University and at mccor University there's a requirement that you do a subject outside of your faculty or there was at the time I did my degree sadly they've they've done away with that requirement now and I was studying English literature thinking that I was going to do a PhD in Science Fiction and Fantasy I was really interested and I still am really interested in the idea of using Science Fiction and Fantasy as genres to explore morality and ethics for humans um and so I found out that was this subject called life the universe and everything and I was like oh I love that novel okay I'm sold I'm doing it and so I I sat down in this class and it was a general education science class of astrobiology and I sat down and my course Conor Simon George uh he gave me a paper by Abigail Alwood who was a scientist at JPL and she's also an Australian and it was her uh nature paper from 2006 and it was about ancient stratales and Simon told me that Abby was uh the in charge of an instrument that was going to go on the Mars rover and go to Mars and I just had no idea that that was like actually an option for an international person um and I just didn't know that this kind of science existed and so I actually ended up adding this degree onto my arts degree um and studying that from then on and it was it was really difficult I have to say trying to learn science without a background in science I didn't understand anything anyone was talking about I really struggled I felt like I didn't belong uh with lots of people and I had to work very very very hard in a to be able to understand and I was very fortunate that Simon he really went the extra mile to Mentor me and really gave me a lot of opportunities and a lot of confidence in myself that I wouldn't have had um otherwise and so I ended up uh doing a master's degree with Simon and we studied some Cambrian stratales and we looked at different like Mars Rover techniques and how you might try to detect life in the geologic record and then for my PhD I went to the Australian Center for astrobiology at the University of New South Wales um and studied fossilized cell membranes throughout the geological record and that's what I'm really interested in uh today and always I love that so much and I think it's important for our audience to remember that everyone's journey into being involved in astrobiology whether we are career astrobiologist or not we all come from many different backgrounds and have many different Pursuits and interests um and I I love that you share that your interest in science fiction as well and that that that quote from Douglas Adams uh tied to that chorus life the universe and everything I think many of us are fans of Douglas Adams work um and I also love that you mention the importance of mentorship for having developed your career and then bringing you to this realm of studying ancient rocks and I know in preparation for the show we were discussing this and you mentioned how you think of ancient rocks as potentially being an unreliable narrator I wonder if you can kind of uh expand on that idea for the audience yeah so one of the books that I studied during my English literature degree was one of the first novels it was um the Moonstone by wilky Collins and in that book that's the first time that they have a lot of different chapters from different um perspectives so you have different narrators doing each chapter and in that book you're trying to work out who stole the Moonstone um but everybody's got their own Truth for each of those chapters so who's telling the real truth and that's how I think about the geologic record especially in deep time you have all of these heavily altered rocks that you know aren't pristine anymore and you're looking for evidence of Truth and you're looking to piece together stories from multiple lines of evidence to come closer to what the reality is um and I just think that's the most fun thing of all I kind of think about the geological record as if it was a book um and I'm analyzing the text so it's just like another way of doing English really that's awesome now our our producer and director and leading up for this wanted me to mention this idea of maybe it's like a billion year old game of telephone um did you guys have the game of telephone in Australia is that a thing you know that that is okay awesome yeah yeah so it's like you know these these signals getting passed and changed through time as organic molecules are being changed and stuff like that and altered in the Rock record through time um so I I very much love that idea you know trying to decipher what we're learning from The Rock record um and trying to understand these organic molecules and that's kind of LED you to a bunch of places um I wonder if you can explain like your your experience and fieldwork and the places you've had a chance to go to yeah so actually doing um traveling for science was one of the reasons I really was attracted to science um and getting to see the world and see what different things are what it's like in other places um so I've been really really fortunate to get to travel to a lot of places in Australia um in fact my undergraduate degree at MCC University had a lot of field work um as a component and that was incredibly uh beneficial I think to my career as a geologist but it was also difficult financially and so that's uh a something that's hard I think with fieldwork because it can be something that can be so enriching but it can also be something that cuts people out or makes it harder for them to attend for a variety of reasons not just Financial um but I got to travel a lot of places in Australia and in fact for our final uh geology subject we go to New Zealand CU we don't really have mountains or volcanoes in Australia and um we go and we do a a trip where we start in the bottom of the south island of New Zealand and we travel up through Mount Cook uh through all of the hot springs through New Zealand and through all of the volcanic terrains and that was you know until that time I hadn't really thought about hydrothermal environments or volcanic environments because I didn't really think that there would be that many fossils there so I was really more interested in like you know fossilized Lake systems and things like that and so during that trip I really started to think about uh more hydrothermal environments and different places on the earth that I hadn't thought about before and then for during my PhD I was able to go many times to the pilra in Western Australia and you've had many people talk about the pillur on this show it's really a fantastic place it's my favorite place in the entire planet I think if I could choose to be anywhere it would always be in the pbra um and I've been able to go to Yellowstone as well which was a fantastic experience for me because we don't have bison in Australia we don't have squirrels we don't have Bears uh so I had a very geologically enriching experience in Yellowstone um and I also had a very like I guess biologically uh enriching experience in Yellowstone um and I've also been really fortunate to be able to go to Sea a few times and so the first cruise I did the first research cruise I did we started in Western Australia and we transited below Australia Through The Great Australian bite to Tasmania and my most recent research Cruise uh we were actually off the coast of Oregon um in axial seamount in the North Pacific Ocean I love that uh I am going to switch gears just for a moment to mention one of the polls uh we asked our audience on YouTube a question uh specifically about the pillur uh and about the town of Marble Bar in Australia which is very close to pillar it's where a lot of folks have been through I heard from a bunch of friends when I was talking about this and put the poll up uh fellow astrobiologists who've been there uh when doing fieldwork in Western Australia we wanted to know from our audience how many consecutive days it has been over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in Marble Bar Australia uh the correct answer was 170 consecutive days so sometimes called the hottest place in Australia because it maintains its heat for so very very long and that's part of being out in the field is going to places on our planet extremely hot places and cold places uh places that are very far from civilization places that are deep underwater places that allow us to better understand life in all its various forms across our planet and trying to understand life elsewhere and so Bonnie I'd like to switch gears now to the origins and habitability laboratory uh at JPL and some of your current work including some of the cruises you've done done uh first off I I wonder if you can explain to us the the premise of your poock at JPL yes I'm uh working on a project called Invader which is the Institute dive bot for exobiology research and the premise of Invader is looking for life at deep ocean hydrothermal vents using uh something called laser induced breakdown spectroscopy which tells you about the elemental makeup of a sample and raen ramen spectroscopy which is a type of vibrational molecule spectroscopy so you get the molecules to vibrate and it tells you um what's going on in this in the sample and so what I'm trying to do is figure out how these complementary uh techniques can work together to tell us more about whether there's life in hydrothermal vents um and I do that through using field samples that we've collected from the deep ocean but also uh through creating hydrothermal uh samples in the lab um and I'm very fortunate to be able to work with uh two interns in the lab so Kathy Trio is working on how hydrothermal fluids might migrate organic compounds and tar is working on um compositional gradients in different forms of hydrothermal chimneys which she's growing in the laboratory as well so we get to do a lot of um laboratory simulations of what I see in the fields which is very fun and it's a new way to uh for me not a new way for other people but for me to think about what's going on in the record cuz usually I see something in the geological record and I have the end member of what we see but in the lab I'm able to study the processes of what put that end member there that's fantastic yeah and Lori barge uh was one of our previous guests on ask an astrobiologist and had a chance to talk about the chemical Gardens the development of these in the lab hydrothermal vents systems which are pretty cool um I know our audience always loves seeing pictures of those I love seeing pictures and videos of those those um so it's very cool that you have a chance to work on that I will say so when we were talking about uh the prep for this episode at first we wanted to pull our audience on the number of hydrothermal systems across the planet and we really couldn't figure out how many they were even a quick Google search was like 300 or 500 I even called one of our past guests uh Dr Jeff wheat who I know is an expert on hydrothermal systems and even he wasn't really sure and we were kind of trying to like Pow Wow together kind of figure out what might be the number uh and so we ended up in the end deciding to pull our audience asking them what the deepest hydrothermal vent system in the ocean on our planet is and so we gave them the choices of the bble hydrothermal vent field the lost city hydrothermal field the Endeavor hydrothermal vents or Magic Mountain in British Columbia uh the correct answer was the bble hydrothermal vent field uh it's where the peard vent site lies uh I will say if you hear that name it does sound very much like someone's favorite captain from Star Trek uh Jean Luke peard was reading about it it turns out that he is indirectly named for the same family uh jacqu Bard is the the what this this vent field was named for uh his father AUST peard was and his twin brother are what Jee Roddenberry named Jean Luke peard for uh so there's always a great way to toss in a Star Trek reference um but Bonnie you've had a chance now to go out on a cruise and actually do some work with the Invader team I wonder if you can speak to your most recent cruise to the axal SE mount for us yes I actually was not with any of the other Invader team members on the most recent cruise to axial seamount um I was on a cruise called Pro atex 23 which was led by Julie Huber from MIT and huie and it was an absolutely fantastic experience we were on the RV um Thompson and we went out to axial seamount and the great thing was that uh we actually had the remotely operated vehicle Jason with us and the Jason team um and I have never experienced anything like this before we don't don't have a remotely operated vehicle like that in Australia and being able to see what was happening on the C FL was it just opened up another world to me that I never really considered or thought about when I was thinking about these uh samples and where they were coming from you know when I go to see hydrothermal systems on land you're right there you're right where it is and you're seeing everything you're seeing the trees fall into the hot springs you're seeing the Bison walk through the hot springs but when you when I was thinking about the ocean I'd really only seen still images so being able to see the camera that the Jason had while it was investigating and and see the kinds of sea life that would come and investigate and play with the Jason and uh come right near the vents was so cool uh so the ship was was wonderful and in addition to our science we had to do shifts so we were allocated shifts doing different things and I was allocated the shift uh doing event logging uh for a couple of hours every day and so would come down to the Json van which was kind of like these demountables and it would have all the cameras there and the Json team would be there controlling Jason and we would sit and we would log everything that the Json was doing so that we would know exactly where samples came from what the time was what the temperature was um and that was so fun we got to see so many different things um and then one of the other roles that I got to have uh on the cruise was to work with the major fluid Samplers so these are these fluid Samplers that can sample like 400° celius fluid and so they can get the hottest hydrothermal fluid coming straight out from A black smoker and so one of the great things about axial is it's a it's a cabled environment and so it's had long term monitoring to see how the volcanic activity changes and how that changes the fluid and how that changes the environment and so one of the things that we were doing on the cruise was getting samples from these really hot black smokers uh so that we could analyze the fluid so that could continue that picture and so I got to um you know take apart these major fluid Samplers and help do the chemistry for the water to preserve it to till we could get back to land and scour them and clean them and put them back on on the Json I think one of the most remarkable things to me was really the diversity of the colors of the hydrothermal vents that we could see um and also just the amount of like sea life living there like all of them were covered in worms and limpets and all these eukariotic organisms that you don't well I typically don't associate with hydrothermal vents and so really thinking about them as complex ecosystems uh not just their astrobiological value was was really mindboggling that's so cool um super jealous one um you know i' I've always loved the ideas of exploring the ocean floor I love the film The Abyss which is very much an astrobiology movie to me um because we're exploring you know deep ocean life not just for humans but for other beings as well and honestly you've now explored across the planet Yellowstone Western Australia using robots to explore the ocean floor we really are trying to understand life in all its Myriad environments on our planet and looking for life elsewhere and that brings me to your current work with the network for Life detection you are currently the lead of the early career Council for the network for Life detection and I'm wondering if you can explain what your role is uh for enfold for our audience yeah so I have uh had a lot to do with enfold over the years so when I was in Australia doing my PhD more than half my PhD took place during Co lockdowns where we couldn't leave the country uh we couldn't really go far we couldn't even leave our state for the for the most of the time and so one of the ways that I tried to stay connected to the astrobiology community as an international person was to participate in enfold activities and that brought me a sense of uh community and and a sense of um being in touch with what was going on even when I couldn't leave my country and so I was very fortunate uh when I came to the US that uh the previously Joey pki uh was stepping down and I was invited uh to take over from Joey and it's been a great honor of mine to help try to make things better and try to represent the early career communities uh in astrobiology particularly in life detection and so I've been working with a fantastic committee uh and we've been really thinking about what are the activities that we can do to bring the most value to the members of the early career Council um and we've been working together to try to increase uh I guess like communication and connectedness between early career researchers because so often you know we sit at our desks and we're just writing or we're caught up in our experiments and it's really important to stop and take a break and connect con with other people because we get so caught up that our work is ourselves and then we forget that we are ourselves outside of our work and so that's something that we've really been trying to emphasize uh we had an event called me besides my science earlier this year where we were really trying to get people to get to know each other um in addition to their science of course the science is very important it's it's why we're there in the community in the first place but we're also people too and I think that's really important for connectedness a man you've done so much work connecting people in their early careers and young students and trying to help others learn about science in general I think actually my first introduction to you might have been through your work with Luke Stellar uh you both were working together in developing scientific education content for sharing with with other people um I wonder what your vision is for for why it's so impactful and important for researchers to be involved in sharing their science and teaching their science to younger Generations yeah I think for me there are very few people who get out of my kind of background and who get to have the opportunities that I've been able to have uh because of the support of people around me my family mentors at University and I was very lucky to be able to have those opportunities and to be able to have a future I couldn't imagine and I want that for other students from my background I don't want anyone to not realize that they can have more if they want it and so that's always been a guiding force for me since I've started doing science and I think particularly with astrobiology even people who are not interested in science are interested in astrobiology and we know that teaching astrobiology to people uh can help them and can Empower them I mean I just look at Daniela scales's work in prisons and what that's done for imprisoned people and how that's helped them with their educational prospects and same with Charlie Kel's work in Scotland prisons as well and so I think that it's so important that we give back you know we we are the keepers of knowledge and it's really important for us to to share that knowledge with other people and to also respect other people's knowledge and what they might bring and so it's not enough for us to just get up and talk at people we really have to sit down with them and find out what their needs are and work with them together in a dialogic manner rather than um getting up and just professing at them I think is really really important and I I've seen that over and over again in the work I've been so fortunate to do uh especially when I was working with the PowerHouse Museum in Sydney I was very fortunate to be able to run these steam classes which is Sci science and art put together and I worked on that uh with Luella Moore who was at the PowerHouse Museum and we created these science and art workshops and we noticed over time that most of the people who were coming to the workshops were homeschooled kids and their parents and so the workshops that we were providing were creating a place of connection for the kids and the parents to learn together about science and then ask us questions and that was something that was incredibly motivating as well I think I love that so much it's so impactful you know sometimes the sage on the stage way of teaching can be helpful but we really do need people to kind of engage and have dialogue and learn from each other to really get invested and interested in learning about our place in the cosmos and so it's such valuable work and I'm glad people like yourself are doing that work for all of us um I will say so when it comes to connecting to other people uh you and I have been connected we've been friends for some time now um one thing I saw since you've come to America and started working at JPL uh you've mentioned a few of the differences you've noticed in American society and language compared to Australia for instance you had pointed out to me that you you keep meeting people who don't know what a fortnite is um I will say I do know what a fortnite is many Americans do but not most I would say and we really don't ever use it in our language and so in preparation for having you on the show we asked you to provide a few Australian terms some Australian lingo that maybe Americans wouldn't know and I put a poll up on my ex account about this uh asking which of the following was not Australian lingo uh hard yaka sarvo watler rig or tuckerbox uh and I know that a lot of people were like had no idea and I think I think the ones who got it right actually are Australians who chimed in watler rig was made up I made that up with the help of chat GPT actually uh the other ones are real hard yaka and help me out here that's hard work yeah hard yaka is hard work if I'm going out in the field I'm doing hard yaka all day and then sarvo is this afternoon and a Tucker box is like a lunch box or a food pail correct yes love it so going out in the field you would be like I'm hard yak all day I couldn't get into my tuo box sa I love it it's so awesome I mean we have to think about how we use language differently in different places that we're from uh not just different uses of a language but different dialects accents ways of engaging with each other it's important when we're trying to understand how we might communicate with alien life one day how do we even communicate with other humans and understand each other uh now Bonnie before we go to our faster than light segment of Rapid Fire questions I do want to talk really quickly you mentioned your interest in science fiction uh and you know reading about science fiction you mentioned to me before the show that you're also into video games that you've put some time into balers Gate 3 for instance I personally Love video games and when it comes to like uh morality and ethical questions about you know space about about our understanding of our environment there's a lot to explore in video games I was just chatting with a student from Columbia the other day who wants to write an essay about moral questions that come up in the Mass Effect Universe uh I'm wondering what are your favorite games for kind of exploring uh big philosophical questions and science together oh I think the one that comes to mind first is only big philosophical questions um and that's this war of mine which is an incredibly uh poignant and emotional game where you play civilians uh trapped in a building during a war and you have to try to make it through the war from either teaming together or maybe you don't team together um that the civilians have to live with the decisions that you make and I remember the first time I made it through that game um and I actually couldn't consume any content for a couple of days afterwards because it was so emotional the kind of philosophical questions that it had placed on me it actually affected me more than any movie I've ever seen um and I think that video games have a particular power to be able to to do that um as far as science goes you know I don't typically play scientific video games because I'm trying to switch off after work um so I usually am playing you know I I still play age of Empires too very frequently um you know it's 20 years old but it's a classic for a reason uh and I particularly really like roguelike games so Hades was a particularly great one and that was of course filled with morality and philos Phil philosophy sorry that just didn't happen for me uh because it was sted in Greek myth as well and so I think games are particularly strong when they can give us something to think about and chew over while we're playing them of course I do also um really enjoy just playing strategy games uh I really like that I think it fil fits in with a scientist's mind of like thinking strategically about how to conserve resources or move things for the future as well I love that so much that's very fitting for some of the questions we're going to ask now in our faster than light segment um again for the audience these are kind of Rapid Fire questions uh we ask them of every guest just to kind of see what our different guests think about these different things so for starters of course enrio fery once asked that question where are they now the big question for you is what is your favorite answer to ferm's question where are they yeah I mean for me I'm always thinking about geological time and so I always think the chances that it's us at the same time as someone else that's in range for us to contact that becomes a little bit more difficult so maybe it's just not the right time we have to be at the right time and the right place en able to to able to find others absolutely and now we are storytellers we've always been storytellers it's what humanity is and maybe that's part of why we're scientists and explorers too uh and from you know books video games movies there's so much out there but Bonnie what stories have inspired you to want to learn more about life in the universe you know I think the story that most inspired me to want to learn about life in the universe is actually The Little Prince uh which is a story about a little prince who lives on an asteroid that's so small that he can just watch Sunset after Sunset after Sunset and a rose grows on his asteroid and she's so vain um and she wants so much from him that he ends up leaving to explore the rest of the universe and it's really a story about imagination and about creativity and how we think about ourselves and our place and where we are and so that book in particular I think is one that really strongly stuck with me as to why we want want to explore elsewhere and what it can bring to us personally to explore elsewhere yeah such an impactful book and it's inspired many people through generations now um if you could go back in time and visit yourself at the start of your career what kind of advice would you give I think I would tell myself to know that I belong and it's not up to other people to let me know that that I belong it's something that I decide for myself uh that was something I struggled with for a long time and still struggle with and so being able to overcome that and have something in myself that brings me connectedness and brings me belonging I think would give me a lot of easier of a career and I hope that's something that other people can think about and it might help them as well with their career very cool um now we're not trying to pick a fight here but if there is alien life out there do you think we'll Discover it first in our own solar system or on an exoplanet elsewhere yeah that's a hard one to know I'm kind of biased because I study in our own solar system um and I I don't think I could answer for kind of uh exoplanet detection because that's a very different kind of Life detection it's a lot more atmospheric and a lot of a different way of approaching uh so I only really know about the kind of insitu Life detection or what you might do with a closer by Mission uh so very biasly I like to hope it involves rocks and not the atmosphere nice I love it um now you know for astrobiology in this realm like thinking about astrobiology thinking about what's possible out there it really makes us think a lot about ourselves and about time uh our past our present and our future so what is something that excites you about the future everything if we think about how young astrobiology is is a field and what it's already been able to do the kinds of advances we've had in astrobiology and thinking about how we need to be more scrupulous where it comes to science we need to be more rigorous we need to question our claims those are things that have improved science as a whole not just our field and so the search for life elsewhere how it's going in the future is something that will impact not just us in the field but the way that we think about science in general and so I think there's so much room for that you know the kinds of missions that we're able to do now the planetary bodies that we're able to visit now that's just going to open up a world of understanding that we haven't yet had and so I think the the possibilities are endless and it's a really exciting time to be doing astrobiology absolutely now we are going to open it up to our audience questions here in just a moment but first we have my favorite question from the faster than light segment so Bonnie what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind okay so this is a this is a popular one and I think it's a popular one for a reason this was the kind of first science fact that I ever heard that made me just kind of go oh whoa geologic time is unfathomable and that is that there was more time between when stegosaurus existed and when T Rex existed than when T Rex existed and we exist and I that just was mindboggling to me because every movie I'd ever seen seen everything I'd ever read always kind of depicted all the dinosaurs together and to think that they existed for so long and were so diverse that that fact could be true was something that just made me sort of stop and think wow I think I understand geologic time but I really don't that's awesome yeah a human perspective of time is so difficult we we really did evolve to think of time in these very short segments you know seconds are fine minutes are fine but even you start thinking of days I can't tell you what I was doing 48 days ago exactly um or even you know years get really hard we think we're pretty good but you start thinking back on the years and I really can't lay out what my year was like three years ago necessarily I I know a few things but uh and then start thinking in deep time it gets even harder and so I think through science through topics like astrobiology it helps us to better frame those things and so I love that fact so much uh so thank you for sharing now we are going to open it up to our audience who are watching live on YouTube right now uh we're going to start off with a question from Jim pass uh Jim wants to know uh how well do you think ongoing discoveries of extrema files on Earth will assist in recognizing alien life on Mars Europa or elsewhere um and what does your work entail especially how and how oh and then Jim being an Astros sociologist also wants to know the importance of social interactions that you have in your work and how that enhances your success yeah so with the importance of extreme files I think the more that we can learn about the limits of life and what life can adapt to the better that really helps us in in guiding where we could search for life in other places I think we always have to understand there are limitations when we think about life on Earth and how that relates to other places and we have to think about that in a very context specific way and so as long as we're applying those limitations and the context to our analog work on extremer files I think that we can utilize that information in a very helpful way but if we sort of blanketly go oh there's a methanogen here on on Earth it must be in the same place on Mars without thinking about that context I I don't think that's the best way to do it but the good news is nobody is really doing that everybody's thinking about it a context specific way at least the papers that I read and so I think that that's a a really interesting approach into thinking about where could life be what are the limits of where life could be and also how does life proliferate in these kinds of extreme environments and what are the specific adaptations and needs when it comes to social interactions um and the work I think you know I've already spoken about how the I frankly wouldn't be here without the kind of mentorship that I've had and the kind of investment that people have have put into me and I feel the same moving forward the things that are most impactful in my day are working with interns and working with students and seeing them make discoveries and seeing them make connections that's really what I look forward to I I work in a lab environment and one of the reasons I choose that is to work with other people every day and so you're in the lab you're doing your experiment everybody is talking around you there's a very collegial environment and it's very nice to be able to actually just turn around to someone and say I'm really stuck I don't understand this thing could you please help me with it and they come from it from their perspective and you come from it from your perspective and you work together to to try to understand this new piece of knowledge um and I I think that's the best part of doing science to be honest yeah not working in a vacuum working together is really important and collaborating together is so important um now with the work in your lab uh sioner pallet is watching and wants to know if you could give us a little bit of an idea of how uh building hydrothermal vents in the lab happens yes so um you can create a some sea water that you might put like a metal in um and then you'll create like a synthetic hydrothermal fluid that you'll put silica in or whatever else would be in that hydrothermal fluid you're looking at and you actually inject the hydrothermal fluid into the sea water and that causes uh precipitation and so over time that precipitation depending on how you set up the experiment uh can build a vent you might not want to build a vent you might want to just build um some hydrothermal sediment so you might do that in a different way uh so you might actually just sort of pet that into a beaker and then see what happens there so sometimes you might want to study how the the structure of minerals uh like morphologically the the shape of them affects something but other times you might just want to study how the presence of those minerals affect something and so there's different ways that you might approach that research depending on what your questions are very cool um now let's go beyond the laboratory to real settings uh some people have argued that the origin of Life likely happened in the ocean around hydrothermal events you may also know that there are other astrobiologists whove argued differently that perhaps life can't start in oceans it needs to start on dry land in wedding and drying cycles for instance uh like the the the hotring hypothesis by Bruce damer and Dave Deer uh now we have a question from KT Shady who wants to know for you as someone who studied both terrestrial and seafloor hydrothermal geothermal settings uh if you have an opinion of which might be more scientifically convincing for the origins of life I don't have an opinion on which is more scientifically convincing for the origin of life because I'm not an origin of Life researcher so all of my um opinions would probably be irrelevant and misinformed to be honest uh but I think that it's really important to study both systems uh there's constant discussion in astrobiology of an either or approach and I think that there's so much benefit to be gained from understanding hydrothermal systems as a whole rather than splitting them of course there are some differences between a land based hot spring system and a deep ocean hydrothermal vent but many things are the same and so I think it's really important that we consider these systems and how they relate to to the specific questions that we're asking if we're thinking about origin of Life maybe we think about what kinds of environments were present in the early Earth and what kinds of minerals were're in those environments and what that would mean for an origin of life if we're thinking about life detection on Mars maybe we think about different questions about probably the same question about minerology to be honest um but we might also think about what are the different kinds of hydrothermalism that might be present on Mars um and we could think about the same with Enceladus and possibly Eur Europa you know Enceladus is probably a very alkaline system whereas Europa is probably a more acidic system and so you would study different hydrothermal systems as different analoges for those as well so I think that there would be a lot of benefit and a lot of us considering uh both sides of the of the coin I would say awesome uh our next question comes from desel drace uh who has a question about serpentinizing vent systems um so for our audience serpent izing systems are those where water and rock are interacting uh in this they can produce hydrogen we know that things like methanogens which can consume hydrogen and carbon dioxide together and produce methane uh can be found in these environments they're very intriguing environments for astrobiology they might exist in the seaf floors of Europa or Enceladus but we know that there are serpentinizing environments in the past on Mars um now the question from desel is uh asking about uh micro environments of varying pH around these systems um so Bonnie I wonder if you can speak to how extensive such micro environments might be and whether there are a lot of varying pH environments around these vent systems yeah so not for the poniz systems specifically but for hydrothermal vents in general they can be a lot of pH gradients um so as the fluid travels through the hydrothermal uh chimney um or if it gets you know produced through a diffuse like vent and uh taken out into the water the pH is to change very rapidly because you're going to have a fluid that's maybe acidic or alkaline and then it's interacting with sea waterer and so that's very quickly going to change the pH but as you travel along the vent and along the minerology the water is the pH is also going to be affected by what mineral the fluid is in contact with as well and so that can change very quickly um over a vent system and we see this in Hot Springs and land as well you might have a hot spring pool that's one pH and then you might have one next to it that's a radically different pH and they might Splash and mix and so I think that's something that people find very exciting about hydrothermal systems is you can have these really radical shifts um in these kind of pH gradients which can um induce uh you know a lot of um it enables a lot of different changes in the environment that life could possibly utilize and so that's something that people look for so one of the ideas with hydrothermal vent systems is you might have like these Pockets or these giant pores in the mineral structure where some water might get trapped or some fluid might get trapped and then that might interact with the sea water as well and then you'd have like radically different phes on either side very cool yeah I mean there's so much to explore in the these environments around these hydrothermal systems um changing gears just a moment uh sioner pallet wants to know uh what do you think the best ways are to ensure Equitable access to astrobiology knowledge uh for people especially for students oh yes so the leading practices in equity and education are being well currently there's been quite a huge redefin in them because of the massive shift to online learning as a result of the co 19 pandemic uh so I had toy online even before Co um and one of the great things about online education particularly in the University setting is that it allows a lot of people to have access to University that might not have had access to it before people who work full time perhaps they have a disability uh perhaps they mothers that have caring responsibilities or fathers that have caring responsibilities um and so being able to learn online asynchronously gives them options they wouldn't have had uh when they were going to UNI face to face um I know I worked full time while I was at uh doing my undergraduate and many people do and my job was you know an hour and 20 minutes away from the University and so that made it very difficult to study and very difficult to be able to get to classes so one of the things online learning can do if it's taught well is increase Equity by giving everyone a seat at the table but what happens is many times it's not taught well um or it's taught in a way that uh actually increases inequity uh one of the things that happens is people teach the way that they were taught and a lot of people weren't taught online um and so once people learn how to teach uh in ways that are more Equitable or put their effort in towards that that can really increase the amount of people that are able to have access to education I think one of the other important things is the University isn't the only way to be educated there are many Fantastic science communication courses and activities that are put on by a lot of different institutions um around the world and so there are a lot of other ways that we can access education and become more informed even if we don't want to commit to a university degree um and so I think it's really important that we always remember that it's not a one sized fits all way to teach it's a many sizes for everyone um and I will say one of the things that we well that I have in particular worked on over the years is virtual field trips and so we have created these 360° panoramic um Virtual Field Trips setting so that people can go to the field even if they don't want to go to the field and that creates an element of choice and I think choice is the most important thing in learning if you arm people with Choice you're giving them the Cho the the choice literally uh to choose what is most appropriate for them I love that yeah I am I personally imagine in a very near future it'll be fairly easy to pop on a VR headset and some haptic gloves and jump into Western Australia with people who are all you know avatars around you and you're actually exploring real rocks even though you're not physically there in person for these virtual Explorations and experiences which really can open up education a lot and so I love that so much uh one of our users rendering reality 3D animations on YouTube um wants to know uh given you know the possibilities for the origins of life in hydrothermal vent systems um he mentioned specifically serpentinizing systems but um do we know anything about how lower than than 1G environments in places like Europa or Enceladus might impact hydrothermal event processes yeah I haven't actually um worked on those kinds of systems before so I wouldn't be able to answer that question accurately enough to give an informed answer yeah I I can personally say I'm not sure uh if anyone's really done very good modeling for different gravitational regimes for hydrothermal vent systems and so it might be worth looking out there in the research maybe maybe using some powerful tools to go explore and see what's been done so far and that might lead to some new places for new research for this user um so Des dra has asked another question um about how vents pull in Ocean fluids uh and the intermixing for ocean fluids um so for those watching so hydrothermal vent systems around these these ocean spreading centers it's where the fluid from the seawat goes into the crust gets heated up around the mantle it comes back out when it comes out it brings along with it one the high temperature high energy kind of environment but also a lot of these elements being kind of stripped out of the Rocks they come through uh what do you think of of intermixing of these fluids and and at what scope do do these fluids intermix in the ocean Bonnie yeah not just uh elements it brings through organic molecules and all sorts of things that that get picked up and I guess it depends on the size of the plume and how far it's going because different one of the cool things about different vents is that they're all sort of different they have different personalities which I like some might have more uh aggressive uh eruptions um and some might be a bit more subtle so it's going to depend on the individual system but I know from when we were on the cruise you could actually see the enrichment of life through tens of meters from the vent so it's not just a completely localized um type of thing it's something that can spread out like quite far on the sea Flor um and when you come up to these sorts of vent systems you see you start to see all the life kind of like coaling on the on the vent and so you have all these limpets and different kind of mollusks and and tube worms and everything and you can really see where the environment starts to get enriched with everything that's coming from these fluids um the temperature change is very rapid you know I was very shocked you would have fluid erupting that was like 320° C and just a few centimeters away the water would be back down to 2° C because the volume of the ocean is so like large compared to the tiny like little vents um and so the the mixing can't be so consistent across the whole ocean like globally that that it changes it um and also in hydrothermal environments on land uh you can really see that temperature change happen as the water sort of travels from where the geyser is which is like the landbased vent um the water will shoot out and it will travel down across what we call the center a and it starts to cool down in different temperature regimes so where it's at the geyser it might be like 100° C and then when you get to the edge of the pool it's going to be ambient temperatures so maybe 20° C and we also see a very large difference in the kind of organic molecules that get traveled with the fluid depending on where we are in the vent systems and so uh there's a lot of different things and very context specific things depending on which specific vent or V field you're looking at that's fantastic I think we have time for maybe one or two more questions let's see uh Felipe bonitz Felipe hey um has asked if you can elaborate on specific adaptations that we know organisms must have to thrive in hydrothermal systems yeah so some um Hy some organisms might be adapted to live at a higher temperature than others so you know there's a limit for life um and how even adaptions like can live so you can't really find many organisms above like 100° C um and so you have different organisms that can adapt to those changing temperatures as well so it's not just enough to be able to live at the high temperature but the temperatures going to go away rapidly once the vent stops uh you know guising and so the organism needs to be adapted to go back down to normal temperature and survive those temperature fluctuations um you might also have you know on the deep sea floor you going to have organisms that don't need light um to eat and so that's I mean that's something that's really cool to think about that kind of uh system that's on the deep ocean as opposed to on land because it's so different than what we see every day some of the other kinds of adaptions that organisms might have are adaption to highly alkaline uh fluids and highly acidic fluids as well um and so those kinds of uh changes in internal pH chemistry can severely affect like an organism's range and being able to to tolerate those as a large adaption um and then in addition to uh heat if we're thinking about somewhere like Europa or Enceladus there're also adaptions to cold as well um so even if it's near a hydrothermal environment that temperature fluctuation is going to be even larger and so thinking about organisms that can really sustain these very very large changes in a system very very quickly awesome um so we have one more question it seems like everyone wants to see if we can pick a fight here but uh Anor mahanti is one of our production assistants he's also now a a just started graduate student at Northwestern University uh honor rup wants to know if you had to place a guess on finding life in our in Celestial neighborhood uh if there's a planet or Moon that would be your favorite uh or where we might find life and what's unique about it oh that's a tough one um so I think it depends on whether we're talking about the likelihood for life to be in the planetary body or if the likelihood for us to find it because I think those are two different things um if we think about the way that we're able to access some planetary bodies it might be more limited than the ways that we can access others um and so our ability to find something doesn't mean that it's not there and so I think those two things uh could be decoupled um I've worked on Mars for a long time um I have a very large soft spot for Mars um I've thought about Mars for a long time because you know if we're find if we're looking for fossilized Life on Mars it was likely from a similar time period than what we think about in Western Australia and so I think there's a lot of potential there especially with the ways that we can explore Mars which are different ways than we can explore elsewhere um Enceladus of course is somewhere that everyone is very excited about particularly with the new phosphate Discovery um and so Enceladus is another place that I think would be somewhere that would be great to to look if we think about Europa this would be a different kind of life again and that would be a different Challenge and how we access the life uh so I think there's a lot of good candidates in the solar system there are actually even more candidates that uh I could bring up uh I have a really self spot for ganim me as well the first assignment I ever did uh was to design like an astrobiological in astrobiology uh was to design an astrobiological mission to gamed to look for life so I I also have a soft spot for Gade um so I guess what I'm saying is I'm a fenit and I'm not going to pick for you I'm sorry yes no fights I love it um yeah there's so many cool options right um I will say for Europa a lot of our audience might know that we are very soon going to be launching the Europa Clipper it's a mission many of us have been following for a long time we're very excited for it to go out it's going to orbit around Jupiter and Europa together and do many many flybys of Europa give us more knowledge of the surface um the environment around Europa high resolution imaging of the entire Moon finally we're going to learn so much more about Europa uh to that effect for those watching uh there is a really cool thing you can do right now it's called Message in a Bottle you can go to Europa NASA ov/ message inab bottle with hyphens between the words uh and you can enter your name to be engraved on a chip to be sent along with the Europa Clipper so your name could travel around Jupiter and Europa and be part of this Mission helping us learn even more I even have my own uh little message in a bottle with my name on it that's going to Europa I do this for every Mission because NASA coms is awesome and lets us do this um and also if you go to that site you can also read the poem in Praise of Mystery a poem for Europa written by the poet laurate ad Leon uh and learn more about Europa Clipper along the way too so definitely do that add your name as a message in a bottle to be sent to Europa which might be one of the possible places where we could find life in our solar system um now finally if you'd like to learn more about the recent Cruise the the Proto ax Cruise uh I think we're going to share the Cruz's blog link soon uh and then also if you'd like to learn more about Bonnie teas herself you can visit her site astrology.com uh you can also find her on social media online follow all the awesome science and work that she's doing Bonnie thank you so much for joining us for asking
