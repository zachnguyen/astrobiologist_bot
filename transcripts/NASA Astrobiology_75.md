[Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] greetings friends fellow earthlings and explorers of all ages and welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life as usual I'm your host Dr Graham the cosmobiology Lao and we are brought to you by the NASA astrobiology program and seanet .org as usual we to give a huge shout out to all of you watching online live right now on YouTube as well as those watching later in the recorded video we appreciate all of your support in the show engaging with us engaging with our guests asking questions and trying to figure out more about this whole process of understanding life this month we're gonna give a huge shout out to Thunderbird on Twitter for asking an awesome question of our guest and responding to our polls we have a lot of fun with these polls every month and so I'm glad so many of you tune in and answer our questions and get involved in the conversation there's so much for us to share there now today's episode is going to be entirely excellent I'm super excited for it because it's going to feature my friend and colleague Dr Jim Cleaves Dr Cleaves has built his career around studying the origins of life on earth and the potential for Life Beyond he's been driven by the question of how and when does chemistry become biology Jim is a senior research investigator at Blue Marble space Institute of science he's the president of Isel the international Society for the study of the origin of life and recently he became a professor and department chair in chemistry at Howard University so I hope all of you will join me in welcoming Dr Jim C to the show Jim thank you for joining us well thank you for having me gram so really nice event yeah I'm super excited to have you here just to chat about your life and your research ask you some fun questions and give our audience a chance to ask some questions as well I know some are coming in already in the chat on YouTube I'm sure more pour in as we have our conversation first with me um I love for all of our guests to start off the episode just by sharing what got them involved in science what was their origin story as a science superhero to bring them to where they are and so can you share with our audience what inspired you to get involved in the career you've pursued um I think it was a little bit by happen stance that uh you know I always like to spend time in the woods when I was a kid I used to play hookie a lot to go fishing down at a creek near our house and I just um by various other accidents ended up having jobs that put me in the woods a lot I was worked as a you know a wild mushroom picker for a while started a business did that which put me through college um College I wanted to be an environmental science major and I just it turned out to be something that was really diffuse between politics and sociology and biology and you know it was really more about you know management issues and I Alo thought about being a philosophy major and that just seemed too esoteric to me when I finally got into the nuts and bolts of it and so I I found that the the science classes were were really sucking me in you know biology and um you know the the the biology 101 textbook you get that's 1500 pages um the first chapter is what is biology what is life and all this and it had a little sidebar that was about um an interview with Stanley Miller who had done the biller Yuri experiment you know so that's you know if you open the book that's the first thing you read I was like that's that's unusual right and so I got got into that war and I I um I took a really good organic chemistry class that was not for preds it was for chemistry Majors so I think it it went much deeper and then you had more time to kind of digest what is beautiful about organic chemistry um and then I went and got a job at UC San Francisco when I graduated as a lab tech and I I just hated it tell you the truth it was a really small lab I just I I like the work but this the work environment was just not good I love San Francisco um so I went into Contracting this was about when the Oakland Hills fire started and um you know we're making been making pretty good money honestly for that time but I realized you know you wake up every day and you do it I I said I'm going to wake up in 10 years and I'm gonna still be doing this you know if I don't do something so um I answered an ad for a job at NASA Ames which was to euthanize mice that came back from experiments on the uh the space station and I didn't i' never you know I'm not really killing things but so I went talk to the to the guy and I said you know I didn't know NASA did this kind of stuff and he said oh yeah we do all sorts of things um he goes but the guys doing the really freaky stuff are in San Diego and I I go what's the really freaky stuff and he goes oh yeah this you know Stanley Miller and those guys have the center for exobiology you know what trying to understand orig of life and how to find aliens all and I go really you know so I thought I would just apply to graduate school and check that out um and it turned out that to do that kind of work I had to be a chemistry major you know to do a degree in in chemistry so I said well that's what I got to do then that's what I'm going to do and uh you know it just I I tell people it's like you know going to a family reunion where you meet all of these relatives you didn't know you had but you can immediately see the connection right the family resemblance and um yeah so that was 1996 and and here we are 28 years later yeah it's incredible and I love that transition from the you know being young and enjoying being outdoors and interested in the environment then realizing there's a draw for you in chemistry and you know you won't hear many people say that they love organic chemistry a lot of people have issues there with like memorizing you know all these different processes and memorizing all these different names for molecular structures and such I also loved organic chemistry though um you know there's so much in chemistry that's so beautiful for understanding the world around us um do you think you know during the process of learning you know about chemistry organic chemistry biochemistry all of this that that's where that that really that that connection came for you in kind of seeing that that connection to the origin of Life the evolution of Life Through Time Through Chemistry yeah I know I think once you once you train as a chemist you start seeing everything as chemistry right it's uh which you know I guess physicists argue everything is physics um but yeah I think chemistry is probably the right kind of scale for a lot of the the the the rates of change that we observe is interesting right tend to be on a kind of chemical scale so yeah absolutely um now you know during grad school you worked with Stanley Miller and then afterwards you went to the Carnegie Institute and worked with Robert Hazen for a while um folks here watching might know that Robert Hazen has been involved in things like the minerological evolution of Worlds and things like that um is that really when you kind of brought like geochemistry and that kind of Realm into your your understanding as well well so in in between that I did a post at the scripts institution of oceanography with Jeff beta and he had been applying um amino acid romiza geological samples right so it's it's a good chronometer for things that are like thousands of years old it's it's older than carbon 14 I think but not as old as some other systems and so you know he just had all this it was right on the beach right so we were always doing stuff that hey you want to test this idea go down to the beach and grab some sand you know or grab some sea water let's measure what's in it and I think that's where I I first got more connected to earth science and stuff but um yeah since that happened it's just been more and more and more um tied in yeah fantastic me I love an astrobiology we have these connections of of different disciplines different ways of understanding from biology and chemistry geology and things like philosophy and sociology that really all come together to this realm of astrobiology and kind of asking these big questions about you know where did life come from and why are we here is there is there life out there and so I think it's so crucial for young people kind of as they develop careers in astrobiology to be open to these different experiences um I wonder if you can speak to that you know if you had to give some advice you know to maybe a young undergraduate student watching right now who is interested in branching out and learning more what would you say to them I mean I think I think just as a as a scientist in particular and as a human being in general um just you know being open to all of the information an experience you can get your hands on to really understand the world around you is it's it's the key right um You Never Know mean the body of information you have to understand to really be effective as a scientist means you can't you never know what two things are going to connect right and be the crucial connection right so you have to be efficient at sorting through information but you have to be open to taking it all in I think and you know it goes goes double for for meeting people right and being open to hearing what they say um a lot of the best things that have happened to me in my career have been just accidental encounters with people at meetings or parking lots waiting for the bus this kind of stuff yeah it's fantastic like Serendipity Serendipity absolutely yeah I love that and so you've also done some work previously as a professor uh and a researcher at Tokyo Tech and through the Earth Life Science Institute um I wonder for our audience if you can talk about some of the differences uh different ways of collaborating and doing research while working in Japan compared to having worked so much time in the US yes so um this was about 20 end of 2012 um I again accidentally met a guy who was involved with starting this new Institute in Japan he he said do you want to do you want a job are you will to work in Japan I said yes and I I was really skeptical when I first went because there was nothing there and there didn't seem to be any body who really worked in this field and I you i' already been in it for a while so um you know the whole thing struck me as very odd but sure enough we built this a whole building it's a you know a large office building a couple of I don't know 200 yards long and six stories top to bottom um that specializes in combining planetary science and origins of life kind of questions um and you know part of part of the point was to try to internationalize Japanese science so this is one thing we really focused on was it not being about the science itself and bringing in as many diverse people from around the world to talk about these questions and try to network um you know as opposed to just rein verting you know knowledge locally so and so you know through Elsie and through these various places you've worked as a post grad school undergrad different positions you've had and research you've done yeah I wonder in your Viewpoint how has the question of life's Origins changed over time either like during your career or just in general how have you seen this question changing uh yeah that's a good question um yeah so I guess I've been at it for a little while now um and I you know I've been interested at the kind of historical change in scientific ideas um you know a lot of things like this don't even have a it wasn't a question till a certain point right or a scientific question till maybe the middle of the 19th century and you know what people like Pastor were thinking about um versus people like Miller versus people like the ones who are active in the field today there there's some commonalities but there's some changes and and some of them reflect I think changes in technology right but also you know obviously Pastor couldn't think about an RNA world right it just wasn't a thing in his his scientific M right um whereas that's you know a leading theory today and then we we see other new like camps like hydrothermal vent sort of models that are springing out of things that were discovered in the 1970s um and you know there'll probably be new ones tomorrow until we until we find a really comprehensive answer I I think MH yeah there's much for us to learn about you know when chemistry becomes biology this question that's driven you and also for us like when does biology in general become biology like Life as we know it here on Earth right I pulled my my audience on Twitter and I I I offered them uh a poll about what features of Life as we know it here on Earth might be least likely to be found uh amongst alien life I offered things like information systems carbon based chemistry water as a solvent multicellular life um of the options people picked multicellular life the most as the least likely thing to happen um maybe that there's more single cell biospheres out there perhaps yeah um I wonder for you like what is your take what do you think is maybe the least likely thing that we have in life on Earth that might happen elsewhere H actually I I'm gonna I'm gonna say our particular genetic code but that's you know I could be wrong you know I one I mean you know when you look at I don't know if you've read like oparin's little book when you see the way he kind of deduces the earliest features of life you know he's like well it's got to be cellular it's a heter TR and this um if those aren't thought structures that we all just kind of naturally fall down you know and it's hard for us to get outside of them yeah once you know something about biology right yeah yeah and it seems like maybe if we we found you know DNA and RNA using the same bases and using the same code amongst some alien life form that we could you know prove in disput it was an alien it almost feels like we would have to have some kind of shared origin then otherwise it seems more likely that alien life would have you know an information system but more likely a very different information system or I mean or you know it could be that you know you can think of evolution kind of tankering in this molecular space and it's always kind of making a slightly Progressive Meandering right that it all kind of meanders to the same place at the end and that would be that would be weird too right so and interesting very cool yeah and in this topic too of like you know what things can we look for for alien life through our astrobiology Miss missions through NASA and our instruments you know if we're trying to look for life out there life could be very different from what we have here and so we have this newer idea that's kind of come around a lot more lately at least in the the the language of tic bio signatures um would you mind explaining to our audience how you view agnostic bio signatures in the search for alien life right so I think um when you talk about looking for alien life you're assuming that somehow it's a thing that makes copies of itself that's separates itself from its environment in some way right so it's it's a distinct phenomenon um and then it's made out of something right and I guess you know again bringing the chemist bias we assume it's going to be made out of chemicals I think there's some valid reasons to think that it's going to be made out of organic chemicals right and then you know that naturally puts itself into the our realm of analytical chemistry we build instruments to measure organic chemicals if we can measure ours we can measure theirs but how are we going to recognize that set of chemicals as a a cohesive um as the cohesive elements of a living system right especially if they're different elements right and so I think what we're what people are starting to think is that you want to be able to detect the system of things whatever the things actually are um but that they're going to be coordinated in some way um that makes them stand out from their environment right and and that's the kind of methodology we're trying to develop is how do you how do you pick out that signal from background noise yeah that's super important like understanding what things are happening biotically what things could happen biologically and how we can tell the difference um between them I do like you kind suggested too like an idea of trying to characterize life um of understanding that you know it's it's replicating it has some material that it's made out of and it takes up some space in the environment and does something in the environment um we also pulled our audience on YouTube to ask them you know and trying to define or characterize life with which you know we don't actually have a set definition of life it's been a really intriguing debate in the philosophy of astrobiology is trying to know can we Define life um we ask people what they think might be the most trouble or offer us the most trouble in trying to Define life or characterize life and we offered options like viruses artificial intelligence replication of crystals uh sterile organisms that can't reproduce or something else um the one that people selected the most was viruses um I think you know even when I was a kid in elementary school and in Middle school like we were being told you know viruses are not life but then you know you go into college and you start studying these things now there's a lot of questions about what viruses really are as biological machines um so do you think it's it's of value to to argue over defining life or how do you view this kind of Realm of trying to characterize life and and do you think things like viruses really do pose the most trouble when trying to understand what life is well that's such a good question I mean viruses are not a separate thing from life I would say they're they're a biological phenomenon if they're not living right um we get stuck in words a lot and I think most biologists kind of recognize the the Continuum that is organismality you know what I mean that you know you have um communities and things that are sort of fluid you have sexuality you have all these things that kind of bore the boundaries between life and organism and um one of my favorite science fiction books is uh Solaris I don't know if you've read it but like the whole planet is some sort of living thing and they they just can't make heads or Tales of it right um so you know I think I think sometimes focusing on the the little odd odds and ends on Earth might be maybe I'm agreeing with your poll might be the wrong place to to focus your energy right yeah it's intriguing yeah I love Stanis love lm's writing and and you know there's been two movies made from carious which is pretty cool um both are worth a watch for our audience if you're interested in astrobiology relevant film um I I love this idea of being stuck in words too that you know language itself is also kind of guiding how we think about the search for alien life and in prep for the show you mentioned you know kind of your your interest in the evolution of language and how language has changed we discussed a little bit things like levels of fidelity and how language is allowed to change and language itself is very you know fluid and moving and dynamic when you think about things like a genetic code yeah it seems like it kind of got gets locked in and stays very much that way with some levels of fluidity um I wonder if you can speak to that the importance of evolutionary processes and different kinds of Information Systems H yeah I you know one of the things that's really interesting to me now I you know so I get a lot of when when students have a complaint I'm the I'm the complaints office you know we have people from all over the country and trying to guess what state they're from by the subtleties of their accent is um is a fun game right often you can be really accurate with this right so I mean it just points the the point of how fluid that kind of information transfer is at the level of language um yeah I don't know maybe I'm I'm going to go I think this this concept of how you store information and how symbolisms evolve over time is going to end up being one of the really crucial questions in this field and I'm not I'm not a big I'm not anti na world but I think it may have been itself already the outcome of a process of symbol encoding that once it got to that was a very efficient way of storing genetic information but maybe not the original way if that's that getting it the question you're asking or yeah yeah makes a lot of sense yeah and in some of your more recent work as well you you've also been exploring like using machine learning and artificial intelligence and kind of exploring for agnostic bios signatures and kind of trying to understand how that technology is working what got you interested in that realm of using kind of these machine learning models and systems to to now apply that to understanding you know what we're looking at if we're looking for life out there yeah so I mean Contin of a lot of things of um you know there's the idea that frequency distributions are are a tool that's used in cryptography a lot right that you can actually tell if you were just to take a French novel and an English novel and just count the letter distributions um just forget about all the information forget the storyline forget everything who wrote it whatever you would be able to tell that one was English and one was French just from the the letter distributions right that certain letters occur more frequently in English usage than they do in French um so that's that's the kind of IDE that maybe as far as agnostic bio go if you could measure a set of molecules you would be able to say well this is obviously a terrestrial distribution of things right and you'd find another distribution you say well this is a different language whatever it is I don't I don't know what the code is I don't know what it's saying but it's a language and it's not our language right and so you know what we do is organic as analytical chemists as we we you know measure things as geochemists we measure dirt and like this and um there are there are signals that are very common to terrestrial biology because of the commonalities of cell structure and terrestrial metabolism and so on and you know people have been interested in studying how things degrade in the environment for a long time um it's kind of a natural methodology to apply to this problem right and so you you can find a kind of cluster of things using machine learning algorithms that really show that terrestrial stuff Falls in a unique phase space um that could be measured with a with a chromatographic equipment mometer right so do you think we should expect that that there will be some things from alien life or at least in signs of possible alien life that will fall into that same phase space or are we able to use those models to also make some make some ideas or speculations about other spaces where we might start finding some commonalities yeah well that that's a good question I mean I think um we have some measurements of like things we pretty sure are a biological organic compounds like things like meteorites um even some meteorites from Mars and so on um and they they do tend to Cluster in a different place of that phase space right and you know to the best of our knowledge it's not living maybe there is some sign in there and we just don't know what we're looking at but it falls in a different phase space and you know interestingly with this the most recent we did we found that there's actually a kind of noo Zone that neither of those things Falls in right and it might you know it would be interesting if in the future we measure something and it falls in that that space that we know nothing we know of occupies right yeah very intriguing now um to change gears a little bit um you're now the president of iso this International Society for the study of the origin of life um it's been around for quite some time um and you know for myself just in my own career I've been watching a lot more you know groups coming together people coming together with ideas about the origins of Life who are involved in the biology and the chemistry and the geology the physics you know all of these different Realms and so it's nice to see Isel and other organizations coming around especially bringing in early career researchers to help them get involved in this larger networking for answering this question um in your Viewpoint you know what what is the value that you see isul and organizations like it moving forward kind of carrying the torch of looking for the origins of Life what can I do a Shameless plug forell please do right yeah so for those watching who don't know issol it's the international Society for the study of the origins of life um it traces its origin back to 1957 they got a meeting in Moscow and it was really this effort you know the cold war was in full swing um there was a sort of you know stove piping of Nations and camps uh which was hindering the exchange of scientific knowledge and some scientists got together and recognized that this was a bad thing for for fundamental topics of interest to humanity like the origin of life and they held a meeting and kind of did this informally and then I think they Incorporated in the early 70s as a formal Society um we meet every three years to discuss topics of Interest the original life we had very low membership dues uh everybody can join we use those dues to support student travel to the trienal meetings um most ISL people I want to say are chemist that's I think a lot of people come at the problem as chemical problem a lot of biologists um more and more geologists and planetary scientists we actually held our last meeting jointly with the um International astronomical Union astrobiology division so I think I think there's more of a a a recognition over time that there's a lot to be had from the dialogue between astronomy and physical sciences you know and so I see I see it evolving um in that direction especially with all the discoveries of exoplanets that are taking place these days right yeah absolutely so cool to see that growth and see these changes um and people coming together to network and share their ideas um and I love your point too about you know this this sto piping of Science and these different National kind of you know ideas and we really do need to come together and so science itself has often broken boundaries space exploration itself has often broken those boundaries to bring us together to answer these big questions it's so crucial for for the future of everyone on the planet that we can do that yeah yeah it really is I mean it's one of the things I love about Blue Marble is it's just so um welcoming right to anybody every human on the planet right so it's yeah yeah so we should talk then about blue Marvel space Institute of science um you know you've been an affiliate researcher with our organization just like I am for quite some time um and as the Director of our young scientist program myself um I'd love to point out to our audience that you've been a mentor for projects over the last several years in our young scientist program and you've brought on you know these undergrad and recent you know grad students or or you know post undergrad students into your projects over the past several years and it's been really fun for me to watch that you've done a a remarkable job of having your past students come back in you know the the following years to help Mentor the younger students and so I wonder first off if you can speak to the value of these projects you've offered and then also speak to how you envision yourself like teaching these young people to become mentors themselves um well I think the value is just amazing I mean I think um there's so many people on earth who have so much talent and knowledge and and and they're just looking for venues where they can you know express it and and contribute and I think the ysp really is such a great venue for that and especially in that it allows virtual collaboration right I think this is a not only good for the planet it's good for building connections among Humanity right um and I've just I've been just so lucky to work with all these people um they're so many brilliant people have contributed amazing things you know at such a young age um so yeah I I I so many people when I look back on my life helped me along the way when I was younger right it's nice to be able to to pay it back and I think you know that Spirit um abounds at Blue Marvel so yeah yeah love hearing that um so and now you have a new role at Howard University where you're now a professor and the department chair uh in chemistry um you know this has been you know this long career Arc that you've had and now you're kind of back in this realm of Academia and being a professor department chair um I wonder if you can speak now to to how you envision your role um in someone leading forward a Department of Chemistry in a university like Howard yeah um I think I I guess I see my my main role is to make people's jobs easier help them be more effective at what they're trying to do and um you know try to remove obstacles to people doing their best work right and doing their best teaching doing their best mentoring um and that's that's what I strive to do it's it's you know it's a challenge so you know yeah yeah it's great it's it's people are endlessly surprising right absolutely um so I do want to get to our faster than light segment uh here in a moment and I also want to answer our audience's questions I see more coming in from YouTube and we have a few from Twitter um a few things I want to ask you first though one I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about you being on the famous game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire when you were a graduate student that out um yeah and so we shared it online already that that was the 15 minutes or is this it I'm not sure yeah ask an astrobiologist maybe maybe now this is it um but being Who Wants To Be A Millionaire must have been exciting maybe you know challenging uh you were a graduate student I wonder if just give us an idea what was that like as a graduate student to to be on a game show that's super famous so it was really funny my my I was working in the lab you know fixing an hlc and the phone rang and it was my brother and he said what are you doing this weekend I said I'm fixing this hlc he goes you got to go to Las Vegas and I go why he said I got you an audition for this game show you you know gu I didn't have a lot of money I was like well I don't think I am doing that honestly and he's like yeah you gotta go so I was like H all right so I bought a ticket you know Southwest Airlines it was like 25 bucks to fly to Las Vegas from San dieg and I went and they you know there were there are hundreds of people they do this first round thing where you take a test and then you have to do a mockup and I think you know the one thing that really kills people is they they freeze up when they have to talk in public and I had already had to be a teaching assistant for like three or four years so I'd kind of gotten over that fear of seeming stupid you know what I mean and uh I got through and they they flew us out to New York and it was just the craziest thing it was you know at the last three minutes you know we're still waiting somebody failed out and there was one more of those fast things and I just got in that's so so I had to stay over for another thing you know it was just like just just the craziest feeling right like that show was like a big thing when it was on you know you sudden real millions of people watching this um I sure hope I don't say something stupid right and so you know we got out for the they like well we need to go to the bar for drink right I was my brother we get in the elevator and who's in the elevator um Lavar Burton right which was like you know like of course everything else today is crazy so of course you just got into an elevator with lar B and my brother was a really big fan of Reading Rainbow you know and he says oh my God you know Mr BD I'm such a huge fan of your show and I think at that time the the Star Trek was that he was on was on right he's like oh yeah a lot of people like Star Trek oh man the um Reading Rainbow so amazing and it's this grown grown man you know he's like yeah you watch a lot of Reading Rainbow do you he said yeah I love the theme song It's So inspirational I think he's starting to think that he was H goose in him you know so he says okay sing the song I said I I I can't you know I don't I don't sing and he goes yeah that's what I thought you know so we get up and had a beer and then you see go our B across the the thing he says hey hey I'm ready to sing the song now so they they they you know they were arm in  arm singing the Reading Rainbow song together I think that was the highlight whole experience to me watching wow that is incredible it was a hoop yeah it was crazy it was really weird though when I uh when I came back um people would start recognizing you in public which is really weird you know like you're standing around minding your own business and somebody goes you know yeah no kidding I mean that was a Big Show at that time I me I remember watching it you know actively um and so I I do want to go to faster than light here in just a moment um but you know you do incredible things Beyond science too um you know we spoke before the show you're interested in playing music you do a lot of gardening which is incredible um and also getting out in nature and and going out into the woods um connecting back to your childhood spending time Outdoors um where's the value in that for you the these things that you do gardening and playing music and going Outdoors how does that play into your your life what rounds you out as Jim yeah I I don't know I mean I just I love um you know the cool thing about gardening is there's there's a certain amount you can do but then a certain amount of it is up to the organism to behave and Thrive as it as it can right and to understand why and how you can contribute to that is a it's just a mesmerizing process you know um and I you know as far as as music I just it's another one of these combinatorial spaces right where there's just endless room for variety and and Discovery right so I think that's where these things all tie together yeah yeah that's remarkable yeah um I love it so much um it's been such fun for me talking with you but now I want to open up some other things and so we have our faster than light segment um so this is where I ask the same questions of our guests but you know with you know very short 30 second or so answers about some different questions we have about the nature of life here on Earth and looking for life elsewhere your career and all of these kinds of things um we have a new question for this month that we're going to start adding in and it's one that means a lot to me because I you know I started off as a nerd Outdoors too in the woods and I started off in biology I wanted to know more about what life is doing I love hummingbirds and whales and there's so many remarkable things that life on Earth does and so for you Jim I wondered what is your favorite thing that life on Earth does uh I want to say tell stories cool I think that's just such an amazing phenomenon yeah yeah absolutely we are storytellers at heart I mean in mythology and understanding where we come from um we are storytellers and I love that so much um you know recently there's been um some idea that we might soon be able to communicate with whales oh um and so this is kind of about this idea of like can we communicate with non human you know terrestrial beings so if you could communicate with any non human organism on Earth what would that organism be and what would you want to talk about I I'd want to say cats and I would like to know if it it's as much fun as it looks like it looks like they're having a good time I don't know absolutely okay um so you know almost everyone who comes on the show in some way has been inspired by science fiction fantasy you know Stories We Told ourselves we are storytellers what stories have inspired you to want to know more about the nature of life in the universe gosh um you mean actual like written stories movies something like well I mean yeah you mentioned Solaris um yeah you know there's there's a bunch of different kinds of stories we we share from our mythologies and and placing ourselves and in the universe in general also to things like science fiction fantasy other stories yeah I me you know we all we all watching reruns of the 60s Star Trek when I when I was kid that was kind of what was on but I remember um being about seven years old and we were practicing rundowns you know in baseball and I took a ball to the head and I was really upset and they were like okay let's go see that new movie that just came out was Star Wars and that was just like something I don't think anybody had seen anything like that right at that moment it just put space so big in your mind and this possibility of alien you know societies and things was just I think that sparked a lot of kids off at that time you know that inclose encounters I think that's the other one yeah but Star Wars in general the Star Wars Universe has really opened up a lot of people's interest in space exploration um and bringing kind of you know our our mythology our fantasy storytelling into space as well um so change gears a little bit here um you know and and trying to understand we do have students watching um who maybe are undergraduates or graduate students um so for you if you could go back to the beginning of your career and give yourself any piece of advice what advice would you give do your best right do your best and try hard this is you know this is the one chance you get every day so so live that day as best as you can right um yeah I I mean you can't you can't predict what's going to happen to you on any given day right yeah yeah yeah there's so much uncertainty out there and our our lives are short and so we do have to make the most of them while we can and enjoy them yeah um and so kind of in that vein you know enjoying our lives and and placing ourselves in the cosmos there's a lot changing right now in society um and so this question can apply to your science what you studied or it can be you know a little bit broader to anything in humanity or future what is something that excites you about the future oh God that's that's a nice question rather than what's the most terrifying thing you see looming on the horizon right um I think there's there's going to be advances in medicine that are going to make human life a lot better coming down the pipeline so I mean they're happening every day now right but I think it's just going to keep happening and that that's that's that's a positive thing to look for to I think right yeah what kinds of advances spe spe specifically are you are you thinking about that might be the most meaningful for you for your family for your friends for all of us um really specific Technologies I mean I think I think they're going to be um cancer therapies that are going to render it a disease like I don't know polio or something like that right it'll just be rare that we can't treat it um and you know that'd be a big deal for a lot of people we'll still die of something else but cancer cancer is a drag right yeah absolutely yeah I love that one scene in the one um Star Trek uh 4 when the doctor heals the person's kidney um she was going to go in dialysis and instead he heals her and gives her a brand new kidney with some simple medicine yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this just things to look forward to right um plenty of things we got to be careful of I suppose at the same time yeah absolutely um so you know You' had you know you you've you know had so many experiences in your career from graduate school there's postto experiences working in Tokyo you know back here in the US now at Howard um but you know given where things are right now if you could restart your career today what would you want to study oh wow you know maybe economics which was something that I hated as an undergraduate I just didn't care about money but but now that I I see it more in the vein of like kind of General systems theory um it's really intriguing to me you know it's all the it has agents and rules and it oscillates and it has chaotic behavior and it does all of this stuff um but may you know I could probably name 10 other things too there just isn't time for all of it right yeah and we don't get 10 lifetimes well so from that before I open up to the audience questions now my favorite question of all for our faster than light segment what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind H do you have one I I have several so I do love that the the moon as it orbits around the earth doesn't just pull water towards itself and cause the tides due to gravitational interaction it's also causing bulges in the earth and so as the Moon is passing it's actually causing us to lift up towards the moon a little bit as we interact with the moon and the sun together I love that it's just mind blowing I I think also the fact that the the Moon is just the same size as the sun and the sky at this particular point in time where we're conscious to appreciate it just seems uncanny to me you know and it you know we're all getting excited about this eclipse coming up it's this might be one of the only planets in the universe where this is a thing right so yeah it's so incredible and we only have like 600 million years yet until that ends right I mean how do you measure a certain number of Arc seconds or something yeah so it's a little it's a little bit which the the Moon is moving away eventually about 600 million years it'll be so far away we won't actually have the the full solar eclipse ever again yeah it's I mean it's crazy right what are the chances yeah so yeah that's mind blowing I love it um so I I do want to open up our audience questions now um I'm gonna start off with a question from Dr Jim pass uh Dr pass is into Astros sociology and asking questions of your cultural involvement in in our work um he wants to know what risks might occur to humans settling on Mars over time um assuming that that viruses or living bacteria might exist there um and then for us handling that during our research you know it's that's a that's an interesting question um I mean I would think the big risks are going to be radiation and probably not being adapted to the gravity on Mars but I'm not an expert in space physiology um I remember when I was in graduate school there was a scientist named Leslie orgal who was big in origins of life and he was telling a story how NASA had called him up to ask him what he thought the risk assessment was of returning samples from Mars in terms of introducing a contagion and he said U he was you know formal guy he had British accent he was British and he said I told them if they brought a rock back from Mars I would eat it so I think he the odds I mean pathogens are so tuned to their hosts the odds that a pathogen on Mars is tuned to human biology might be kind of low but interesting yeah I mean we do have many pathogens on Earth and only a small fraction of those impact humans yeah um so that is a very good point um this next question is really intriguing to me as well from Daniel Lapin uh what are your creative processes that help you in your work and exploring Prebiotic chemistry they want to know if you have any contemplative creative processes that help you in your research or any embodied creative practices that you that help you in your research I I think I think going for a walk always helps you know just un unfocus your mind and just go and um see where that takes you and I think also um Library roulette I just think is I swear by it right go to a library and just unfocus your eyes and the first book that catches it grab it and see what it's about right yeah I've never done that before I love that idea I'll have to try that next time I go to the library we have a question so this is from our ambassador of the month Thunderbird um who in answering that question um about understanding you know defining life and understanding what key things might be different in alien life they've said that that anthropocentrism is the biggest problem in their view that we often only talk about things in terms of Life As We know it um and they say like what if what if it's a sensient light or a plasma or silicon based life or some form of Consciousness like in Solaris that we can't comprehend yeah um I I love those wh ifs uh uh how do you feel about that that question are we focusing too much on Life as we know it yeah you know I think the thing that really keeps me awake at night is you know there's this idea of the singularity and that we might not be that far away from such a thing if it is a thing right and you know that's a relatively short period of time that we've been making tools and being human what's on the other side of that thing I don't even think we can think about it right and it I would think that the majority of civilizations are so far on the other side of that thing if they exist that it might be really hard to yeah even fathom what we're looking for how to communicate with it or understand it you yeah it's a good good point one one of the uh one of the users on Twitter who responded to my poll also brought this up that we might not even be able to recognize you know a sufficiently advanced life form so much as in Arthur C Clark's quote that a sufficiently advanced technology would appear indistinguishable from Magic maybe in some ways a sufficiently advanced civilization to us might kind of appear in a way that we actually can't comprehend it being what it is yeah I think about this a lot I mean how much you know even perception of the natural world depends on on cognitive structures we have right and there's some things if we see them we can't even integrate them into our environment right conceptually because we know they don't exist for us right yeah absolutely well let's jump to another question here hendrik Holst on YouTube has asked uh given all known metabolic processes and corresponding molecular species interactions could an AI design a plausible minimalist organism that could arrive from non biotic chemistry wow that's a cool idea yes why not um maybe we're not I mean we've been trying to do some work on that kind of topic not using AI using more combinatorial of computational tools but yeah that's a that's a cool idea um yeah I'm sure computers are going to be a big part of of cracking these questions honestly so and probably AI so yeah absolutely it's changing so much already and it will change the future most certainly uh we have a question from Aruna Vadar um a past ysp participant um arunava wants to know if multicellularity is a strict requirement or prerequisite for intelligent life to originate in the universe wow um or is you're even single cellularity right or cellularity itself I don't know I I mean I guess it was here um what maybe it will depend on what we mean by multicellularity maybe colonialism is you know living in colonies is the equivalent and that can lead to some pretty complex behaviors in cognition I don't know it's very intriguing to think like could it be possible could there be a Solaris planet where there's not really any cellular material at all but it has a Consciousness and an intelligence of its own um and so yeah you know it's very intriguing to think of what is possible based on what we know what is consciousness on top of that right yeah I mean yeah I mean we talk about you know we don't have a definition definition of life we don't really have a definition of intelligence nor a definition of Consciousness either and maybe we have to meet some some smart civilizations out there first before we can actually kind of answer any of those questions um there is one question here I see coming in that I'm going to answer uh from era Ravi on YouTube they want to know if uh they say neutral bacteria I think they just mean any any kind of General bacterium can mutate and transform into being an extremophile um I think it's important to remember with this term extremophile just applies to something that can survive and thrive in extremes relevant to us and so extremophiles on Earth we use that term to apply to things that are extreme to human life but to some organisms that's just normal living and we humans who breathe oxygen you know this crazy thing that breaks stuff down we are the ones who are extreme and so my answer would be you know yes Evolution finds ways to feel niches in the environment and that includes pushing out to the extremes of what's possible for life um but a very fun question uh now Jim for you uh the the wise Turtle fun username wants to know um if our def the definition of if our definition of life is open enough to allow for nonbiological life oh so non terrestrial biological life I guess um I think it is I think it is um you know I think what it say chemical systa working definition is chemical system capable of imperfect self replication um you know that captures Darwinism and it captures reproduction and all that and you know that that could be a pretty broad class of things right yeah yeah yeah I think the question too is like you know like post biological life you know right now there's a big question are we going to create artificial general intelligence in the near future here on Earth you know and if we do is that life is that a living system um we had Dr Sue Schneider on the show many episodes ago now it's we're on episode 67 now she was on some time back but we had discussed this idea of is alien life more likely to be post biological built out of these AI systems that that living systems have created and it's a good question we just don't know yeah yeah yeah I mean the the you know there's like the next year kind of future and the 5 years from now kind of future but the the 500,000 year kind of future I think is really Tippy you know in ways that we can't really anticipate right now so yeah yeah every time we try to anticipate the future we are wrong you know there's a lot of things we've been right about in science fiction and and you know writing our stories you can look back at Star Trek and see Technologies being built you can read em forsters the machine stops you know the early 1900s predicting the internet there's all these things we can do but but yet we're almost always missing out on some key things that can happen yeah and so it's amazing what you know what comes into existence uh through our progress and change yeah I the way the ways that our technology changes us too right it's it's a it's an interplay yeah um yeah I I would I would I don't know what your consensus you guys came to but I would guess that most life in the universe is post biological it seems yeah it seems likely yeah if we're looking at you know human civilization you know we're thinking you know humans have been here for a couple hundred thousand years human civilization tens of thousands of years and we're already maybe at the end of that we might be at the at that cusp where we're going to create a post biological life form so maybe alien civilizations once they emerge don't have a very long period of time before they go to that we really don't know but it is possible I mean I think the the the space of time between Agriculture and and written language and today like that's a blink of an eye right um we have two more questions I'd love to get to in the time that we have left first off uh from Ruth on YouTube who's watching um they want to know um about measuring and detecting molecules from abiotic sources from Earth and Mars um and what the most common patterns are they share I guess maybe the larger question they have is about abiotic sources of organic chemistry and how we did how we distinguish those from biological Mater materials yeah so so um well this kind of goes back to Stanley Miller I guess was you one of the first examples of showing how you could AB biologically make biological molecules um and we you know we know of a few processes there basically different kinds of high energy radiation impacting different kinds of chemical mixtures and forcing them into excited states that recombine to make more complex molecules um there's there's a lot of nuance to the ways that can happen right and what the outcome is so we probably need to get a a pretty good survey of all the kind of background ways that can happen before we go looking for for biology yeah that's the key right now is understanding you know abiotic sources biological sources and how we distinguish them and that's it's it's crucial for looking for life out there both for Life as We Know It And for agnostic bios signatures as well um we have one more question and it's from our senior production assistant who's also watching and interacting in the chat on YouTube uh Sarah uh not too long ago went out on the jy's resolution um which was doing some Drilling in the lost city hydrothermal vent field um so Sarah is now also an affiliate at bmis and Sarah um she's very intrigued in the idea of there being an origin of life in vent systems um either the high temperature hydrothermal vent systems or like lost city hydrothermal field which is a low temperature vent system here on Earth and so she wants to know what your thoughts and feelings are maybe on the idea that life can originate in vent systems both for here on Earth as well as for our icy moons in the solar system yeah that's that's you know one of the big I I mean I want say there's kind of two major models for origins of life one is the kind of tidal pool model and one is the kind of bottom of the ocean model and uh you know they're they're both interesting right um if the the title pool One turns out to be right I'm not saying it will that doesn't bode so well for Icy moons I guess if the bottom of the ocean one kind of supports that idea a little bit more um I think I think we're still at the point where we have to keep an open mind about all the possibilities not rule anything out I love that the question why why is Earth the only planet that seems to have life in this solar system right yeah yeah I mean as far as we know so far we haven't found signs anywhere else yet yeah we're still looking yeah that's right yeah but yeah I love that Jim let's keep an open mind let's work towards the future to keep answering questions about the past and about where we're going uh thank you so much for joining me for this conversation Jim thank you for having me it was a lot of fun I appreciate it yeah it's been a huge pleasure uh that's the end of our time now for those who are tuning in right now live on YouTube or watching later on uh the video recording uh if you'd like to learn more about our show uh get updates from NASA astrobiology about really awesome events and opportunities and all the cool things that are going on across the astrobiology realm please sign up for the mailing list it's the best way to learn about what we have going on at ask an astrobiologist also the great way to know what NASA astrobiology is up to in general uh so for Jim Cleaves for joining us thank you so much for your time for answering our questions to the audience watching thank you so much for joining us uh now and in the future and remember everyone stay curious [Music] [Applause] [Music] he [Music]
