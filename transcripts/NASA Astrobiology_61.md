[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] e like that kind of okay I think that works okay I'll do welcome everyone to day two or three however you want to count it was Monday day one I guess so welcome to our planetary protection session I'm so excited about this one because as astrobiologists we don't um always think about the geoconservation of things um and it's something we all need to keep in mind so I think this is going to be very informative our first talk is by Sarah swis um talking about the case for conservation of outer space and Analysis of conservation as a planetary projection strategy thank you okay is this volume good great okay thank you guys so much okay yeah so today I'm going to talk about conservation of outer space um from a policy perspective and I am going to talk about that but I'm also going to make it more of a broad talk today um about how the humanities and interdisiplinary research Theory might inform your research and maybe spark some ideas for how you could collaborate um with other biophysical scientists and then maybe people outside of the biophysical Sciences so this this is quite the pace change maybe from all the other talks you guys have been sharing such wonderful science and kind of engineering information um but this is just a fun way to maybe kick off the middle of our conference and hopefully you leave with some different perspectives um so first off don't that's my bad oh you're all good well my next slide is talking about this image this is called Manifest Destiny it's by a painter from the 1800s and you might keep this in mind as we roll through U the policy analysis perspective on uh conservation and then I'm from the University of Central Florida I'm starting my second year in a master's program there in interdisciplinary studies and I focus on Law and policy and ethics so I want to start with this image to kind of set the tone of maybe what we're doing as astrobiologists or at least back when I was doing the science I kind of like this it resonated with me and then also now when I do more of the social side of things uh sometimes it does feel like this sometimes it just feels like days are long um but there is a major element of curiosity and open mindedness and empathy I think that comes with an interdisciplinary field like astrobiology this is the flan engraving we don't know who did this it popped up in some meteorology textbook in France in like the 1800s so just an interesting idea to ground us yeah so today it's going to be a broad talk and I hope you walk away with something that might resonate with you so we're going to talk about planetary protection from the space law and policy perspective the issue of ISR isru and situ resource utilization and how that's going to pop up and maybe affect astrobiologists conservation as a policy strategy what's up with that and you'll hear a lot more later with one of our other talks in planetary um protection Humanities and interdisiplinary research in astrobiology what are some benefits a little bit of my experience and how I've really enjoyed that and then colonialism and planetary science that's what I've learned from my interdisplinary research and maybe there's some insights you all will want to take away today or think about so planetary protection policy there's two main ideas grounding this there's backward contamination which is the idea of preserving the Integrity of the Earth's biosphere from contamination from any sort of space life forms and then there is frontward contamination so preserving outer space environments from contamination by um Earth you know organic compounds or life forms these are the two grounding principles and kind of the reasons why behind planetary protection why there's whole offices there's whole um un you know talks about it and a lot of funding that may or may not be affecting your research around planetary protection and something to note too in the policy space is that the transition or handoff um or interplay between like public and private research and government research is a big deal here we have a lot more private sector work in space after Decades of you know the government nationalist Space Race and that's going to affect planetary protection because frankly we don't have a set legal limit um or kind of enforcing body that can really go hardcore on enforcing planetary protection so that's kind of the policy context kind of the law context now let's think about the economic potential of space so in 20123 the space industry was valued at $630 billion which is a lot of money there was like a McKenzie report in a world economic Forum report saying that in I think the next 5 years it might be at like $1.8 billion with all of the prospected technological advances and this is a lot of this money is coming from plans for expansion into sub industries that are built around space resource uh utilization and a lot of that is resource utilization for exploration of space without having to continue to go back and forth you know between Earth and outer space could we mine resources from the Moon could we mine resources from asteroids to take us on this kind of like space highway so you could think about maybe 50 years ago in Rural America there might be gas stations along the highway that get you from you know somewhere in the South and from Florida up to to the to the Northeast well that's kind of the idea of development here and this is kind of intertwining and sometimes opposing scientific government and Industry interest as we have more public or more private driving of this development of the space economy this is just a little reflection moment what is the value of the Apollo 11 Landing site like what would it be worth what comes up to your mind is it a number A Feeling a fear I don't know so that's just an idea as we think about the development of the space economy and this broader planetary protection context um so now let's think about the extractive potential we know that we live in a global economy based on extractivism where we extract resources from resourcer areas um some of the geology side there and then we bring them and we um bring them around the world in different trade patterns and sectors and so the idea behind the development of the space economy has a lot of extractive language tied to it and a lot of extractive logic we're talking about shifting from kind of the satellite hanging that's driven a lot of space economy over the past couple de decades and a lot of space concerns around orbital debris to now resource identification and utilization infrastructure which is quite different um and that involves interaction intense interaction with planetary surfaces and bodies uh which could really affect our science or our scientific opportunities um and then also thinking about National interest and National Security that's a lot of the language too U militarized language or um the way we frame other countries and our interactions with them or relationships with them this you can see if you Google like lunar helium 3 mining of the Moon there's a lot of National Security interest or framing around that and then also infrastructure development so like we said gas stations on the Great Space Highway what's going to take us from point A to point B without always having to come back home here I hinted at this there's potential effects on our scientific inquiry and capabilities um you know we want to do science people want to do development there's a lot going on there and it also might affect how science is doled out um and how science is given a priority or not given a priority I know this seems like a pretty pessimistic T take there's also opportunities right maybe for things to coexist um with private development and expiration so I want to you know lend a thought to that too but I'm just pointing out maybe some potential roadblocks or issues that could pop up from our scientists perspective and the societal effects this is just a really broad issue um there's a lot we could think about with how space mining could affect global Society um and socioeconomic inequality or flourishing our health here on Earth that's something informed by our current global distribution of resources and the way our economy runs and it could really be affected if we add in this huge influx of value and materials and money from outer space um so that said here are just some reflection questions related to isru and City resource utilization so kind of the space Highway how are we feeling ourselves and getting resources just some stuff to think about and thanks to Erica for helping me come up with these questions um that might be relevant to you as a scientist or engineer you can take a moment to just read them maybe something pops out to you and if you really like these types of questions maybe you would like policy work um but yeah so transitioning on a policy solution um often in the literature the space policy and law literature people say Okay conservation like we do it on earth right we do it good amount on Earth maybe nowhere near enough as we should um but this is something we could do to protect lunar and outer space environments and there are some strategies which they might sound kind of fun or funky but this is really like stuff people are saying to do and it really is just kind of mimicking what we do here on Earth so space Park systems very much like our national parks this coming from a US perspective but I know these are successful in many countries and I'm sure we've all had like many wonderful beautiful memories hopefully like at National Parks so a similar idea to that um establishing more world heritage sites but considering expanding what we talk about as the world this could be inspired by a precedent of like the dark um night sky the idea that that's part of our common human Heritage and like protecting that which is great for us astronomy oriented people um and then also really important for people's cultures and ontologies and then looking at extra territorial um region law and policy so extr territorial that just means like research like what they do like in Antarctica or how we have the law of the high seas or like the law of our climate or like the atmosphere which our regions nobody can really own and it's not like we can just tell the UN you know solely to govern that so we have some precedence from how we've dealt with research or resource utilization in those areas of the world um when we think about conservation terrestrially though it's usually in a reactionary sense right it's reacting to the impending or pending threat that's constantly there of something being enclosed and extracted and used or something not being used responsibly um because that's just how economic incentives generally work in a global sense and so keeping that in mind might help us when we think about conservation outer space is are there some Logics or some experiences that we're just replicating and doing Earth 2.0 are there ways to maybe reform or make things better or is conservation maybe just not the best framework for us or maybe it's really useful these are all questions that maybe someone from the humanities or a policy analysis perspective would ask and want to think about and so one useful kind of critique or critical perspective is the myth of the frontier which is entwined with imperialism and colonialism if you grew up here in the States this was in a lot of our messaging whether that's interesting TV shows um or in classes at school or AP History this is just a big part of it um and it kind of relies on the idea that there's a panus or there's a nature or an earth or an environment separate from human activity that ought to be preserved or overcome or managed and that logic underlies a lot of what we do in terrestrial con conservation and we might repeat those ideas um which we could say might be ethically undesirable or um not just in outer space so is there a need for conservation the whole point of what I'm saying here is that conservation in itself while we've all had probably many positive experiences with it on Earth for sure um and seeing it maybe protect our home local environments or something else we want to save for future Generations um from destruction it's not necessarily in itself like a morally good thing you could argue it's something we do in response to other human activities and the need for it is shaped by how we uh construct our economies how we construct our social processes and so it kind of lives in a bigger bigger idea so if space exploration continues through an imperialist approach with the language and the function and the economics of that conservation yeah we could repeat it and it could be a great way to help us um but there are worlds where maybe we don't necessarily need conservation as a policy approach um but if we're going to move forward in this extractive way it seems like we are we should really consider it as a important policy strategy but we can also be critical of where it's coming from and the limits of it and also I'm not saying conservation's bad by the way you know I'm not again it's not necessarily good or bad that's not the argument today it's more just to provoke thought about the context um for why or why not we could use conservation as a policy strategy and where do we go from here so this is all kind of stuff that I'm thinking more um or that other people are arguing but interdisciplinary work really helps us see how our science fits into the bigger picture it helps us see how maybe our goals of objectivity in science or that kind of standard that we claim to enforce may or may not line up with how other knowledge systems in the world are working and that can be scary or confusing and it can also be an opportunity for sharing and growth um and improving our science and also just improving the world in all Pursuits of human knowledge it's also important to collaborate with social scientists law on policy people which I've heard so many people already talk about their interest in personally doing that or their experiences with that I think there was a talk yesterday Michael where literally collaborating with philosophers which is amazing um so yeah and then also maybe most importantly a little self reflection on our values and our experiences in the world and understand where where imperialism is inherent to the processes of funding research development language that we use and understand that there are other perspectives in the world even though the dominant perspective is so p is so dominant and we can do our best to listen to those voices Center them and respect and uphold their rights to exist and um be a part of our conversation so at the end of the day context is just really important it's something that sometimes in the hustle and bustle of being aign stist or an engineer trying to get funding turn things out sometimes we lose sight of that and so it's good to be aware of the context for what we do the social context and that's what the humanities can bring to astrobiology I think again this was not you know a super dense idea here today it's more just to provoke thought um where can maybe the humanities or social sciences inform your work um or provide A New Perspective and because I'm getting my masters in interdisplinary studies I sometimes I'm like what what does that mean right my little jokes like masters of none like Jack vre's masters of none but I think there are some skills um that come with interdisplinary research Theory this is a field people work on or like the science of Team science science and technology studies you might have heard these things at your University or social scientist or practitioner of the humanities talk about these fields but really the skills that underly interdisciplinary research kind of like the competencies that Crosscut them are things like empathy taking perspectives understanding complex adaptive systems and resilience um translating between different disciplinary vocabularies and ident identifying context so these are all just skills that I'm sure you all develop every day um in science these are inherent to Scientific processes but maybe you know just like lend a second or a thought or reflection on how you feel like you're doing with these and if there's opportunities to improve them or maybe ask others for help or learn from others and I would love to hear your stories and learn from you about those um too and then I know we're coming to the end here so I'll wrap it up by saying in my interdisciplinary research experience I did work in undergrad related to climate loss and damage policy which had some interesting cross connects um with like astrobiology and space policy especially in that extr territorial sense like who owns something or can legislate something and so there there was kind of some work I did on decolonization from the perspective of a settler trying to understand what that idea is and how to engage with it meaningfully um so here are some ideas that are important there and then also my future work I'm hoping to work on is common objections I've heard this is just very anecdotal of people when they hear about decolonial Theory which is a very practical theory about repatriating land back to people um it can be something we think of you know psychologically or that we support which is important but at the end of the day it's about centering indigenous peoples and letting them have rights to self determination so I want to work on kind of providing some response to fellow scientists um and engineers about um maybe some objections they're feeling to that so yeah um I would like to acknowledge Sam Baker and Amy um liblu de Bara who were my research Partners years ago when I first started this research Amy used to go to AB grad conon back in her grad days um yeah and I thank you all so much for listening again this was just to provoke thoughts so please let me know your thoughts [Applause] hi Alexia from Cornell that was really interesting um I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what work is being done on the policy side in terms of like our government and what the current state is as far as like space conservation goes yeah um I not sure of like the current state as of like maybe this last fiscal year or I don't want to speak to that I'm not necessarily an expert in that but I do know that there are a lot of like inter agency working groups this from a federal perspective um not necessarily International um but there's a lot of inter agency or there's at least one inter agency working group dedicated to like planetary protection and what that means is it's just representatives from like different federal agencies or um members of Academia or um Private Industry experts who are going to come together and talk about this issue what it means for specifically American policy objectives um the current administration's objectives or interests and goals and then how to move that forward and I know they produced a report I want to say last year again I don't want to like try to summarize it or anything um because I'm not quite sure I'm just coming back into this field but there are there is work being done it is not legally enforced or like mandated there is no governing body internationally but there are experts sitting in a room talking about it producing reports that would be my summary so yeah hi Danny bucke uh Penn State I was curious about what you've seen of successful ways for scientists to make connections with people in the humanities and invite in people who maybe don't have expertise on the subject of astrobiology specifically but might have interesting insights based on the the work that they do and how that could have links into what we think about I guess I'm just asking what are some of the ways that you've seen successful collaborations begin yeah definitely one that's like so interesting of a field and something I'm hoping to work further on like in my Graduate Studies and investigate that more from that like kind of Science of Team science perspective and how that actually plays out um and some of the values or interest or Logistics of that I will say what comes to mind is one just looking around and asking other people has that played out for you how is that played out like I don't think there's really a resource that necessarily gives a guide book or an outline for how this goes um if anyone knows let me know like um in another field or astronomy astrobiology space science related so definitely it's more I think anecdotal and just listening for success stories which I feel like I've sometimes and then also there are some grants or specific situations I'm blanking in this moment but there was one astrobiologist I think his name is Dr Steven Freeland who ran a like Workshop where he brought together practitioners from all different disciplines um and they did some interesting like activities to kind of translate between the vocabularies of the humanities and the Sciences so there's some examples of that and that was a big report a very good report on that in like 2016 um but otherwise I can't really think of like a book or a manual or an examp example um I think a lot of times it's just those informal connections and then people being willing to do the process of explaining where they're coming from and having a listening ear and like taking that perspective was not a really great answer but I I can totally email you like the link to that one [Applause] Grant e oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

we're going to have to forgive me losing my voice today as well so we're just dealing with that mic issues okay our final talk today is going to be Fletch or final talk in this session is going to be Fletch talking about exoo conservation of Mars putting Theory into practice and I'm going to say I've introduced myself as Fletch to probably everyone here but if you ever want to find any of my work you are going to have to use CLA Fletcher my actual government name um so that's just a quick caveat for everyone all right so to get into it a little bit about me um first of all I got into geoconservation because I did a master's on the oldest evidence of life on Earth over in the pilra and how we would create a road map for the conservation of those sites um from there I got really into Mars and I decided I would do a PhD on the EXO geoconservation of Mars and right now if you have no idea what EXO Geo conservation is EXO for space Geo for Rock conserv a is what you know and love the word was invented in 2018 it's why no one knows what it is um so pretty timely and I have been looking at both policy and practical aspects of EXO geoconservation so the first year I was looking at policy if you are interested in policy particularly after Sarah's talk um please read my paper but I'm not talking about that today instead I'm talking about my second year of work in my PhD the Practical Elements which I did with experimental work at the Mars desert research station where I was for two crew rotations earlier this year so why would anything geological need conservation I'm going to take an example from my masters these sites are stromatolite fossils from the pilra they're 3 and A2 billion years old and they've been exceptionally well preserved now these sites have been used as a Mars analog most recently in the perseverance Mission uh and that is because because they are 3 and a half billion years old which is similar in time to Mars's theorized warm and wet period but their exceptional preservation is not just the fossils themselves it's the broad environment that you get there these fossils within their ancient environmental context is key but even though this is a really important site it's very rare ancient scientifically valuable there's been significant theft and damage of these fossils and it's not just aesthetically displeasing but uh this is actually a real issue because by removing the fossils from their broader context we lose information about the environment of early Earth and how life may have formed or evolved in that environment so why then would Mars need geological conservation I will not explain to anyone in this room our goals for going to Mars I think we are all familiar um but what I would like everyone to keep in mind here is that to meet all of these goals the sites that we need to go to and explore are sites with really key land forms minerals paleo environments maybe even fossils and what that is describing is sites with geoheritage and that we might want to explore and do our science on but without damaging like we've done to the pilra and that is what exog geoc conservation is so again if we use a little example from Mars this is uh the home plate digitat um these little white lumpy bits um and they are opaline silica found by the spirit rover and this site is an intriguing site uh because of the morphological similarity to digitat found on Earth and the digitat found on Earth have been shown to be microbially mediated um so even if if you don't think that the hom plate digitat a microbially mediated it's an interesting site because how can pure geology make the same morphology as something that's biomediated that's an interesting question and also home plate is both has evidence of both Alkali and acidic Hot Springs preserved there so another really interesting geological question but it's really small so the digit Tates occur discontinuously in this area in the dash line um and that means that small simple actions can destroy an entire site like a rocket landing and even though it's a little silly animation that rocket is to scale on home plate that's Falcon 9 to scale over home plate so there are actually real risks here despite me being a little factious about it so I decided for the second year for this practical aspect of going to the m desert research station that I would look at developing and testing methods of simultaneously exploring and doing exog geoc conservation uh as a way to allow for the effective insitute decision making strategies guiding EXO geoconservation of Mars it's a lot of words um and so this this is what I'm talking about this practical aspect and I'm going to mention here that no one ever has done a practical EXO geoconservation study um for Mars and certainly not done it experimentally in the field um so that's what I chose to do at the Mars desert research station and I was there for two crew rotations so a full month living and working in an analog environment but why mdrs um first of all like I've said EXO geoconservation shouldn't limit our exploration in our scientific study we don't want to do that um however no one will blast me a Mars to explore it while doing conservation work so I needed a geological analog here on Earth um and preferably somewhere where I can live and work in an analogous environment to what it would be like on Mars there's also been about 20 years of continuous Institute research at mdrs and if we look at uh similarities to Mars exploration and science it's not dissimilar from the amount of time since spirit and opportunity landed on Mars so there's a lot of data at this site and really key um is that we're mitigating risks by doing this not only am I not risking billions of dollars or human life by going to Mars but we're mitigating risks of accidentally destroying important sites on Mars by trying to test these sort of things here on Earth first so a little crash course at the mdrs MD D RS site um the geology is a flat as you can see um it is very undeformed um for anyone that's a real geological nerd in the room this is the Morrison formation that we're in which is one of the key dinosaur bone finding formations so it's an extremely well characterized geological formation but importantly flat um and it hosts a series of marine regressions and transgressions um and therefore cool paleo environments that definitely had water shallow Seas uh and you know paleo channels fluvial deposits and you can actually see this along here is a Paleo Channel um and these paleo channels in particular have been extremely well studied and characterized at the mdrs by previous research there's other geological similarities between this site and Mars um mdrs hosts a lot of conc ctions of a similar size and form to those found at meridiani Plum however they are a different minerology um and it's pretty lifeless on the surface but what you do have is lithi which you can see in this little green Arc in a broken open Rock here uh and there are the occasional plant or lyen but mostly litho and this is all working in my favor for using this as a Mars analog for my EXO geoconservation work so a quick note on methods and it will be quick um I spent a lot of time before going there identifying what sort of features I would want to look out for conservation mapping them planning transects a through D um lots of planning beforehand and I decided I would also draw up some methods uh for how I would make decisions while I was in the field and there's quite a simple Matrix and a very slightly more complex decision tree don't look too closely though because now is where I reveal um Mars's heart it all went wrong for a month oops um happens to the best of us uh so to get into the issues the first challenge I had was in our mission operations you need permission to do everything out in the field where you drive where you park where you walk where you stop where you sample you can't just go and follow the interesting geology and if you're a geologist in the room um you'll you'll realize that that's a little inefficient for one and for two pretty antithetical to regular geological research uh and so for us what we would do is typically go out to a site study it in depth and return rather than a traditional transect and this meant that um and for Mars as well this means that you don't actually have have a truly comprehensive idea of what is in an area only at sites it's Point data versus continuous data another challenge that we had was the distance that we could actually travel uh I was there in Winter our Rovers were battery powered you do the maths on that one um that's not an issue for Mars we've solved that we can power a Rover that's fine uh what is interesting to note is that I personally over my 4 weeks there traversed 86 kilm which is the equivalent of spirit and opportunity and curiosity to date combined it's a bit of distance um over the two Crews 291 and 292 our total cumulative distance traversed was about 480 km so that's the radius of argia plena on mars or if we want to put it into a local context it's the equivalent of here to Plymouth so we we went a bit of distance and even in that time we could not find all the targets that I was looking for and we certainly could not predict where they might crop out um which was annoying and I mean sorry I'll go back to this for a sec you can see um we stayed pretty close to the roads uh not always but generally and that is because we had some Mobility challenges um of course it's a suit and you're trying to climb a hill uh anywhere where a Rover couldn't go would actually be a risk to human life uh we found um but most of our interesting targets were in these difficult topographies particularly these paleo channels here um so we need to look at some more novel methods of exploring sites like this before risking human life you want to know that it's actually worth the risk to go to these sort of sites we also struggle with field ID um if you do anything with your hands at all but particularly geology you'll know that having big gloves on and holding things 30 cm away from your face through a perspect frame it's not helpful um but it meant that we had to take samples and that's not really what I wanted to do um but it was important to us that those samples told us something if we were going to take them and so I put a lot of effort into knowing what samples we had back at home what we needed to know and what the minimum sample size was to learn that information I also struggled a lot with the scale of our or my study targets versus the surrounding landscape um many of my study targets are in the order of centimeters to a few meters when you've got a GPS with plusus 3 meter accuracy at best uh that's not super helpful Mars also doesn't have GPS and so what was really key was that I was there for two crew rotations and we could go back to sites and see them again and use relative positioning to find what we were looking for and this is also where I note that it's us as scientists that determine what the value of a site is scientific value was just made up by us and that also meant that the exog geoc conservation value was just made up by us and so it changed over those two different Crews we also struggled a little bit with recordkeeping um papers had indicated that certain databases would be available to us we asked the director he wasn't familiar and we don't know when between those papers being written and us getting there those databases sort of fell off no one expects bad recordkeeping particularly not from people going to space um but it happens particularly with time and changes in administration so the more we can do to stop this the better so to summarize this really quickly and give us some lessons for Mars's EXO geoconservation firstly we can't do EXO geoconservation remotely there is not enough detail in that we need to do on the ground work but when we're on the ground it means that we have to conserve on the go because we can't plan it properly beforehand uh but conserving on the go as hopefully I've shown is kind of challenging and it's also time consuming so when we go to Mars and we're sampling it but trying to be conservation minded it wasn't important necessarily for us to have the tiniest little sample or only one sample from a site this traditional conservative sampling method it was more important that the samples were considered they actually told us something and we learned something new from them so all in all um we do have a really strong need for a best practice guide for field methods for going to Mars and there is a role for exog geoc conservationists in Mars mission teams not just present Rover teams but future Rover teams and crude missions thank you questions what's a Paleo Channel what's a Paleo Channel um old Channel uh basically um it is the channel from a river and the it's hard to do with holding a mic River um and you'll get sediments washed down and cement together and over time in this case we have inverted paleo channels um the surrounding material is softer it erodes away and the bottom of the river is preserved now up the top of a hill so it just allows you to see all the river deposits in sequence y I'm Miguel from the Spanish Center for astrobiology thank you so much for this amazing talk uh so I was wondering um how is how is exactly the process of choosing what needs to be conserved do you have a set of guidelines or is there a degree of like arbitrary decision on your part it's both so when I first began this study it was going to be a much smaller portion of my thesis um and it's blown out to be quite big um and this is because I thought initially I would do a literature review from literature on Earth about how we decide what to conserve and I found essentially nothing when it comes to conserving geology the the best guideline we have is the iucn the international Union for the conservation of nature sets out what they call seven key elements of comprehensive geoconservation um and they say for any broad area if you conserve at least one of uh like one of each of the Seven Elements all seven in total you've got comprehensive geoconservation those seven elements are really broad it's things like evolution of life it could be any fossil um or it'll it'll be like representative land forms uh so our system on Earth is pretty poor um and so I did I did use those seven elements uh in my study which I I haven't gone through here but I've identified um what I thought would be key features at mdrs in each of those seven elements and then I did a more targeted look at those evolution of Life elements in terms of what has good like preservation potential those sort of things um but once I got there and actually was doing this study that's sort of where things changed a lot because our team values changed it meant that what was important like what's a representative landform you know um and that changed because our crews decided that something was more representative than something that I could look at on a map remotely in Australia before coming here and say oh I think that'll be representative so there's no real good system but even if you try and use a system it doesn't work very well okay so I'm sure anyone that's taken a geology class knows that you've all the time just go out and see a road cutting and start hacking away at it with no precaution at all and you're like how much Rock can I destroy um it kind of becomes a game so I have experienced classes where we go to more um like ideal sites where we learn about geoconservation and preserving them do you think teaching geology students from like first year level about geoconservation will make a difference in the long run um for future asro geologists or do you think that's just kind of too difficult to put into place on a like Countrywide or worldwide Spectrum short answer yes um the long answer is that uh there are some sort of like best practice guidelines vaguely about field sampling um and when I say some I mean like one maybe two in the world um which I tried to do a lit review on and failed miserably because there was only one or two um but there are some sort of guidelines about oh do you sample at this site do you not what what should you do um and introducing those earlier rather than later I think it's a great way so that everyone is aware that that you should be thinking about responsible sampling throughout your whole career rather than just whacking any old rock and taking any old rock and um I mean if we go literally all the way back to the beginning this is so annoying um these sites in wa and their damage this is like I can't explain to you how middle of nowhere Western Australia this is um and also I don't know about you guys but most people look at these and go that's a wiggly Rock like that's nothing uh they don't realize that it's an important piece of you know Earth's history um and so we presume that these sites are actually being damaged by scientists who want essentially a trophy it's it's geology's the answer to trophy hunting um which is kind of upsetting honestly um so the more that we can do to to think about that at all stages and if you are teaching undergrads you know bring it up to them um they probably shouldn't be taking home literally like 30 kilos of rocks um you know bring it up tell them uh it it's something that we can all do a little bit of [Applause] yeah all right we are on break until 1040 Sarah is no 10:20 let me double check I think it's 10:20 yes we are on break until 10:20 Sarah's on her way back with fresh coffee for everyone [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

ahead and get started while people are coming in just so we don't cut into lunch our next session is going to be to infinity and beyond all about exoplanets the first speaker is Cara pesota talking about Prebiotic chemistry from hydroling Titan and exoplanet hay analoges sweet hey is it on can you hear me Yay good morning everyone uh first of all I'd like to start by saying a huge thanks to the organizers for having me here and putting on such a great conference so far Round of Applause thanks Meg cool and I'd also like to thank you guys for coming out to the exoplanet session uh I'm not a biologist at all but I do love lab work and it's been really fun to see all of your experiments and what you guys are up to and today I hope to convince you that exoplanet laboratory work is also really cool and interesting so today I will be talking about my work in understanding atmospheric hazes and what their role is in our broader conversations about astrobiology uh so I know there's a wide array of backgrounds in this room so I'd like to start off very simply by introducing you to my friend methane I'm sure that many of you are super familiar with this molecule in a bunch of different ways we've already heard about it this week but this methane molecule lives as a gas particle in the upper atmosphere of his Planet he enjoys traveling being an active participant in his planet's methane cycle and he enjoys hanging out with his good group of friends including nitrogen water CO2 and helium who all live in the atmosphere with him his pet peeves include UV light that shines in from his planet star and charged particles from cosmic Rayes or energetic particles that get accelerated in the surrounding magnetospheres these things are pretty destructive for methane uh but unfortunately he does have to endure them quite a bit so when UV light and energenic particles reach a methane molecule it undergos a chemical reaction called falsis so this incoming energy from the radiation breaks apart the methane molecule or photo Associates it uh breaking it apart into these where's my pointer these um highly reactive radicals that can recombine into other molecular species and this doesn't just happen to methane it happens to all of his friends in the atmosphere and since we're no longer just talking about that carbon and hydrogen from uh methane uh we get these really complex molecules that have nitrogen and oxygen in them as well so these solid particles are our hazes so to summarize the last few slides hazes are solid particles suspended in the atmosphere that are produced from photolysis of atmospheric gases we generally care about hazes because they affect things like a planet's energy budget atmospheric Dynamics and even surface processes it can be pretty difficult to tease out like how Haze affects these things because it often depends on the haze particles size and composition but thanks to models observations and lab experiments we are starting to tease this out one of the coolest things I think we've learned about hazes is that their composition is chalk full of Prebiotic molecules most notably amino acids and nucleo bases this means that Haze could be a source of organic material when we're thinking about life on other planets and because of that we want to study what happens to Haze after it forms so let's jump jump back to our little Haze cartoon friends uh Haze is efficiently removed from the atmosphere and falls out onto the surface whether that's through time or something more efficient like rain if anybody lives in a place where wildfires are common uh you know that smoke that sits in the air um you'll know that it takes either a few weeks or really good rain to get all that nasty stuff out of the atmosphere this is the same thing that's happening to Hayes on Earth and on other planets um so Haze is efficiently removed from the atmosphere is one of the main suppliers of material to a lot of surfaces and can make up these large scale features like dunes or it could find itself in some liquid body of something right and I don't have to tell the people in this room how important aquous environments are for chemical reactions and I especially don't have to tell you about how liquid water is important for these reactions so this prompted us to ask the question what happens to organic hazes when they interact with liquid water do their compositions change maybe we see signs of polymerization and can we detect these changes in real atmospheres but before we ask these questions I do want to introduce some of these real atmospheres to you this is Titan the well studied hazy Moon of Saturn it has a nitrogen and methane Rich atmosphere that is efficiently photoed and it forms this really thick Haze layer in Titan's atmosphere now methane on Titan is like water on Earth there's a methane cycle and methane rain meaning that the haze can be efficiently removed from the atmosphere and end up on the surface we see Titan surface in this image here uh these lighter spots are the Dune fields and these darker regions are the methane Lakes but underneath this surface Titan has a Global Water Ice shell and underneath that shell is a global Water ocean so there's plenty of water on Titan it's just all locked up inside it would take events like impacts or eruptions of a cryo volcano to expose and warm up this water uh and models suggest that liquid water could be stable on the surface for hundreds if not thousands of years as a result of these types of events all of these things together make Titan a really intriguing Target for answering our Science question another very unique opportunity we have comes in with exoplanets so there's types of planets out there that we don't have in our solar system uh you may have heard of super Earths or warm Neptunes and these types of planets have tentative observations for both Haze and water in their atmosphere now in this case we're using uh atmospheric water vapor as a proxy for liquid surface water which is something we think we can do in temperate exoplanet atmospheres um and of course we'd like to know that for sure but there's really no way to understand these worlds since they're so far away in the same way that we can understand closer in Worlds like Titan but that's where lab experiments come in right so we are informed by observations and we not only want to match and Aid those observations but we simulate exoplanets here on Earth in order to understand these worlds in a way that our current technology doesn't allow so some of my labmates have done a lot of amazing work in characterizing hazes on other planets and their experiments with temperate waterr exoplanets uh readily produce Haze and the chemistry of these Haze analoges um are distinct from our Titan Haze analoges and they're also distinct from each other with only slight differences in exoplanet conditions so with that in mind we're going to answer our question what happens to Haze in liquid water for three planets or worlds I should say Titan a 300 Kelvin water Rich exoplanet and a 400 Kelvin water rich exoplanet first I will walk you through our Haze production process then our conditions for hydris and lastly we'll get into some results this is the phaser chamber located at Johns Hopkins University U my adviser Sarah HST built this uh to simulate photochemistry in a wide range of planetary atmospheres so we can choose what gas mixtures we want in our atmosphere and then warm or cool them to a desired temperature we flow those mixtures through this stainless steel chamber where it is irradiated uh by different types of light so we have a UV light to simulate light from stars and we have a plasma source to simulate charged particles uh Titan experiments glow purple it's really cool and that's due to the nitrogen content and then our exoplanet experiments are like more blue in color because of oxygen so that's always fun might be a video it's not a video just kidding anyway after a few days of letting these gases react with the radiation uh solid particles start to build up along the walls and the bottom of the chamber these are Haze analoges so we scrape the sides of the chamber and collect these samples to do analysis on or use in future experiments so my future experiments were hydris so I just dunked them in some water in these little vials and let them to sit for 3 weeks uh and after those three weeks you can see an appreciable color difference which was a good sign to us that chemical reactions were indeed happening U then I will also note that we had to separate the soluble and insoluble components of this sample for our different analysis techniques uh this whole experiment was a bit proof of concept because nobody has uh taken these types of measurements of hydrolized samples before so you know bit work in progress it was fun to figure out the methodology but yeah this is what we had to do is analyze them separately sweet okay so the results we are looking at today are called transmittance Spectra they were taken by a furrier transform infrared spectrometer and in this plot we're going to be looking at wave number on the bottom x axis and wav length on the top X AIS uh I'm sure hopefully you're familiar with at least one of these two things um they both are measures of light essentially uh but wave numbers are typically used by chemists and wave lengths used by astronomers so I do have to be very careful to include both on every single plot transmittance on the Y AIS uh means that a transmittance of one means that no light or excuse me all light makes it through your sample while a transmittance of zero means that no light makes it through because it's all being either absorbed or scattered by your sample uh the brown Line's going to be the insoluble component of our hydrolized sample while the Orange is your soluble component we also have this like white or gray line which is the original unhydrolyzed sample Spectra for comparison uh we took Spectra from4 to 28.5 microns this covers all of the jwst range and most of Hubble's range as well uh but for today we're going to focus on this small mid well it's not that small it's a log scale small infrared region of the Spectra because that's where most interesting things are happening so experimentalists care about this because uh functional groups show up here but astronomers like it because a lot of molecules absorb in this region and those absorptions create almost like a fingerprint of the atmosphere they're looking at cool so let's start with Titan uh in the upper left we have our full spectrum while our mid infrared is front and center here for a time I can't go into all the changes that we see after hydrolysis what's happening here so I'm going to just start with a few that I think are most interesting so for our Titan samples the most interesting thing that happened was oxygen incorporation our original Titan synthesis has no oxygen in it right it's just falsis of nitrogen and methane so these Peaks it's that little guy right there and that little guy right there those are new peaks in our hydrolized samples that weren't there before and those correspond to co stretching uh so that's really big news I think that you know this has major implications for habitability on Titan because it opens up a whole new range of possible Prebiotic Pathways okay cool exoplanets uh our 300 Kelvin waterish exoplanet sample uh the exoplanets do have water in their original synthesis so we're not looking for incorporation as much as just shifts in the bonding structure and we do see those here highlighted in purple green and and yellow uh so the purple region is going to represent different o stretches that are changing somehow and I think they correspond to these green and yellow regions uh that are responsible for nitrs isocyanates and amides we're particularly interested in the green region because that's where a lot of amino acids show up so I'm very curious to characterize these samples further and understand where that's really coming from we unfortunately can't get that from transmittance Spectra but stay tuned we're excited and lastly our 400 Kelvin water exoplanet uh you'll see right away that there's no orange line that is because we did not collect enough soluble sample to analyze um it's interesting because the Spectra look broadly similar to the 300 Kelvin exop Planet but there must be some difference in production rates due to different chemistry that's happening so I will be running these experiments again this summer with some updated methodologies and we're hoping to get production rates as well to maybe tease out why the 300 and 400 Kelvin planets are producing different chemistry cool so as I mentioned these transmitted Spectra don't actually give us really detailed composition measurements uh instead the goal of these measurements was to use them in deriving Optical constants Optical constants are wavelength dependent values that describe a material's absorption and scattering so they Define that fingerprint that I was telling you about earlier uh modelers and observers use these in to produce their synthetic Spectra so ideally these people would have access to huge databases of optical constants just filled with every molecule that they could possibly see in their atmosphere so they can mix and match these Optical constants until they match the Spectra that they see in real observations we would like to add hydrolyzed hazes to these types of databases so if there's any modelers out there hit me up um yeah it would be awesome to see hydrolized Haze in a real atmosphere for next steps uh based on the Spectra we do think you could see the changes from hydrolyzing the samples before and after in real Spectra but we'd like to produce our own models to show that for sure so that's a good Next Step but then the main thing I'm interested in is this Mass spectrometry measurement because that's going to give us detailed composition analysis of what amino acids what nucleobases are being created and destroyed so stay tuned for that uh hopefully I'll be doing that within the next year or so sweet so I'll just say a quick thank you to the Hurst group at John's Hopkins particularly my adviser Sarah Chow Heath for teaching me everything about the lab Sarah Moran for giving me samples and life advice and of course everyone at Hopkins and my friends and family I will leave up a summary slide and take [Applause] questions hey Mike Wong from Carnegie Science one wonderful talk great results I always enjoy seeing phaser lab things I was wondering when you take the haze product from the phaser lab and put it transfer it into the vial for the hydrolysis do you keep that anoxic or is there still is there oxygen in the head space of that tube that's a great question so we collect all of our samples in a nitrogen glove box uh and that's typically how we store them for these experiments um a bit for Simplicity but also because we knew that these were sort of preliminary we did take the samples out of the glove box to do the hydrolysis we didn't want to put water into the glove box and right now we don't have like another one to contaminate um but we figured well we're going to be putting them in water anyway what's like Earth's atmosphere going to do worse than what we're already doing with the water maybe that's not the best approach but since these were preliminary we ran with it and I would love to hear any experimentalist suggestions for how to make that better cool thank you oh oh sorry uh hi Jan from University of Arizona uh thanks for the very interesting talk uh I'm just wondering when you like uh simulate the production of the haze in the chamber like will it be uh slightly different when you consider the transport on Titan like both horizontal and vertical transport that's a great question so since this is all happening in the upper atmosphere of the planet like most of this UV is happening way up high before it gets absorbed by other things um our pressures in the chamber are really low it's on the order of a few mbar so I don't think we have to worry so much about like the intense winds that are on Titan um but the gas is getting continuously flowed through so there's no like stagnant gas in there yeah thanks one more so great talk um I loved it I also do stuff on Titans so I love and um I've actually cited your adviser in a paper before um so I know you mentioned that under Titan surface with possible like liquid water if there was like you know a comet or some type of like destruction could come out and like be on the surf wouldn't that necessarily just exist then as a solid just because of how outside the habitable zone Titan is from liquid water existing and would it have to be warmer for that to happen and then also sorry um another thing about your methane cuz love methane too um but since methane exists really small and it's an IR like a irreversible destruction do you think that you know potentially there won't be any I this is just more purely sorry um but like later on um um methane can't be you know reproduced and stuff like that so do you think that would impact these you know organic molecules in the atmosphere yeah great I'm going to answer the second one first while it's fresh in my mind uh so yeah the whole like methane story on Titan is not super well known um it's obviously very effectively destroyed but we don't know what the replenishment mechanism is uh I would love to find out and that's definitely you know if we ran out of methane we'd stop getting Haze and that would be weird really weird implications for Titan but yeah I just say that's an open question in the field still and the first one was yes right yeah so we're really basing that off of a set of like models that had been done that showed I I don't remember like the impactor size right now but for a certain impactor size uh it's the impact generates enough heat to keep liquid water stable for a long time and you know hundreds of thousand of years is not a long time like geologically or anything but it's plenty of time for these types of reactions to occur so you know there's also plenty of work to be done if you took the sample out earlier like if the water was there for a lot less time but you know that's all future experiments cool thanks sweet that's it thanks [Applause] [Music] all right our second speaker in this section is going to be pulaa speaking about simulation of potentially habitable environments on the surface of exoplanets okay um okay there is a laser yes okay than so hello everyone can you hear me out okay nice um so I'm paulaa I'm a MTH student in astronomy at the valongo observatory in Brazil and my advisor is Lan gazi and here you can see our collabor collaborators and to summarize my research is about potentially habitable environments on the surface of exoplant but but what are those potentially habitable environments okay uh here I have this list of potentially habitable WS last year it was potentially hitable exoplanets they changed it this year and in this list you can see exoplanets most likely to have a rocky composition and also they are in the habitable zone of each star but what is the haveone uh is the distance of the planet from its Stars where it's possible to have liquid water on the surface of the of the these planets okay so um pay attention for this first one Proxima centar B uh it orits the closest star of our solar system it has around 11 to 12% of uh larger than the earth Mass uh it was discovered by radial velocity method of detection in 20160 and it was confirmed recently in 2020 by sis mascar uh all of those PL exoplanets here were found around M dwars because of the limits of our uh detection methods uh except of those two ones that I highlighted here they were not find found around mws so ignore them but uh what are M dwarfs M dwarfs are low mass stars around 08 to uh 55 uh solal masses here in this Peck you can see a comparison uh the size of Proxima B and for example Jupiter and our sun M drops comprise around 70 to 75% of our solar neighborhood and they are interesting to S exoplanets as you can see in the potentially habitable World list however andrs can be very challenged because of it fles can be frequently and intense uh in a flare event the star realize a large amount of radiation including UV radiation and UV can be important for life for example the vitamin D production in a human body but accessive exposure can lead cells uh to oxitive stress and nucleic aess damage so considering all those features of M DS remember interesting to exoplanet however uh challenging environment of radiation and flares we can make the questions can life Survival on these conditions so to try to provide data to try to answer this question um we perform experiments at the lab with extreme conditions considering UV aration and gas compositions we performed our experiments with microorganisms and then compare with the pr and B prma B surface okay first we have to choose our microorganisms um we us it a East Hoda D it was collected in Brazil Jam CH uh our group uh have been studying um jaman China because it's a interesting place with interesting feat uh featur that can be analogous to the Mars environment for example the high solar incident of radiation and the presence of iron oxides in the soil H and we call it d23 because it's from the 23 collection site okay but what about our eradiation experiments we used two light sources uh the first one was a UVC tubular lamp where it has this peig in two uh 54 nomer in the UVC range and the second one was a UV continuous Spectrum lamp this lamp uh covers the entire UV range so just remember we can split the UV range in UVA UVB UVC here you can see the we lines so again the UVC lamp is only for the UVC and the UV covers all those three UVA UVB and UVC okay so uh our re uh we aded in in saling solution and also desicated it in the nature you can find the where is is not uh in the presence of water and that it has has a low metabolic activity and uh the we use the asog Asam is space and planetary simulation chamber where you can change the pressure the temperature um the gas composition the light source so I think you guys are usage to it because of the past lecture um okay about the atmosphere of Proxima B we don't know the composition yet also we don't know if this planet can hold an atmosphere so we have to make our guesses uh we used two interesting compositions um for biology uh the first one was 100% of CO2 what which is a extreme scenario case for CO2 and also it's close to the mar atmosphere of 95% of CO2 and also a possible composition for the primitive Earth of 80% of C2 and 20 uh 20% of N2 we keep the pressure of the earth and we used the continuous pcture lamp and our East was desicated in this experiment okay so just to summarize We performed six kind of experiments the first group of experiments was in silent solution use the UVC lamp and con Spectrum lamp and the second group was our e desicated with the U lamp J spal lamp asro C 100% of CO2 and asro C PRI Earth 80% of CO2 and 20% of N2 okay uh after our experiment we count the colony from units where we count the colony of viable cells and our experiments were performing trates okay so let's see our results so for the axis the y axis I have the V n per n Zer n z is our control samps it was keep in the dark all the time and N is the IR radiated samples for the xais we have the fluence value Jews per meter Square okay and at the top here we have the desicated for the continuous spal lamp in green and UVC lamp in uh blue the X uh and here at the bottom we have the orange for the UVC lamp in silent solution and purple for the continous spal lamp in silent solution so as you can see we have a steep decreasing for our sing solution curves and the desicated curves keep almost constantly actually we are expecting these results because of the low metabolic activing desate cells so it can dis better with the uh radiation damage okay now for the desicated experiments but for high values of fluence um again the blue one is the UVC lamp and the green one is continous Spectrum lamp so here for the continous spectal lamp you can see counting of viable cells until 10,000 ju per met square of fluence and uh for our UV lab we have counted to six ,000 um value of fluence um so and also you can see a steep decreasing as well for the cous Spectrum lab compared to the UVC lab um a possible explanation for this is because the UVA UVB and UVC range are responsible for different kind of damage the UVA and UVB areal for reactive oxygen is species and UVC is more for for the products so here in our continuous spectrals the cell the cells are dealing with these two kinds of uh damage uh for as can now and our estimate SP compositions again the same axis uh we have the Contin spectr lamp uh again and we have the pink and Diamond one for 100% of CO2 and we have the yellow gold Circle one for the Primitive Earth so you can see that 100% of CO2 is is very close to theous spal lamp but there is a difference between the 100% ofu And primitive Earth we are not expecting that so we want to perform more experiments to investigate this difference okay now about the Flux Of flares of our star proimos senturi um to obtain a spectrum of the star is very challenging uh especially UV flare and for m draw uh remember that we don't have UVC in the surface of Earth UVC do not reach reach the surface of Earth and also MRA had that peig and the infra infrared so um it's about modeling um but we found this um work of Wes 2007 who analyzed the FL of 52 M dwarfs uh he observed this it stars in the galaxy Evolution I SP in the univ Nu UV bands here you can see it's very close to the UVC and after some math we calculated average value of 7 wats per met S at the distance of Proxima B which is 0 485 uh ABA 2020 also used this value for average value of FL so okay um again our results for the desicated East with u lamp Spectrum lamp if we calculated uh the time remember that we have cting to 2,000 10,000 and 6,000 okay so calculating the values to the hour to reach this values on the surface of prma B remember the seven wats per met squ we can found it to 6,000 uh for the Uvis lamp it can resist to a flare of 2 hours and 2 hours and a half and for extremely scenary case that the continous spectal lamp you have a survival to a flare of 24 minutes about so to our future at perspective we want to do the same analysis for other exoplanets and is files we also want to perform more experiments with asro can and with this work we want to provide valuable information for the future analysis of Bio signatures uh for this uh generation of telescopes and Facilities uh and my message is uh we perform a radiation experiments with the UV lamp UV UV lamp and ISRO cam our e Hoda n showed um interesting micro microorganisms to study the radiation resistance and the potential of Brazil and Jama China to search for ex files or is the analog environment and also the prab environment can be challenge for Life as we know cuz Okay it can survive to a flare event of two hours or maybe some minutes but if you consider much post fles per day or per month maybe it can be challenge for life so that's it thank you yeah uh thank you so much for the for the talk um I had a question how did what was exactly the protocol for drawing the cells uh okay um let me show you the th again so here we use the this is the Teflon to make the cells easier to remove it and to count after our radiate experiments we DED the cells in desolate water and then I made some drops here in the tff and let it dry to make sure the water was evaporated so it's dry dry CS here no I I just wanted to see that you didn't dry them with Salon solution so that's that's great okay hey great talk hello yeah uh I was wondering if you've thought about like future experiments with other bacteria or other types of stars and how you think that might affect your results um yeah I'm thinking uh about to do the same analysis for other ex exoplanets [Music] um uh I'm in very interesting in movs and the environments of movs and they can be very challenged uh in the this aspects of radiation and also if a planet can like Earth can hold an atmosphere so I'm very excited for the next Decades of results from jwst and so on so um for the future uh okay I want see if there is an atmosphere or not not okay so it would be a difference the atmosphere to protect the life and and also the aspects of how much uh the large amount the amount of UV radiation reach the surface so I expect this uh the time of the flare events can be shorter or tiny depending of the radiation that the start realize that's cool thank you yeah if I was just wondering how you like deter the viability of you reg them and cfu or how do you meas theil of ah okay uh okay so the E are here so I put them again in a silence solution and then I do all the uh the dilutions seral dilutions and then I put it in plates uh like that three drops and every drop there is a community of colonies of viable cells so it's here we have two drops right forever delution and every job has a group of colony and farming units so I count this Colony so here you have some amount of viable sales so this it's how I made my [Applause] CS e testing testing okay hello so hi everyone my name is Cindy Lou I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas at San Antonio just finished my first year um so my topic will be can the presence of a super critical ocean explain the atmospheric composition of k218b I don't think I got the pointer I'm so sorry okay so what is k218b it's a type of Exel planet called a sub Neptune so it just means it's between the size of Earth and Neptune and we don't really know what their structures are like we don't know if they're more earthlike so more terrestrial maybe Rocky maybe habitable or more like Neptune so more gashes with these deep envelopes or something in between but these exop planets they make up the majority of confirmed exop planets so we really want to be able to characterize them to see you know how many of these are more earthlike and you know what are most of these EXO planets like so a lot of different structures have been considered for this exop planet so first we have a mini Neptune so like a smaller version of Neptune second is a rocky world so that's a super Earth with a terrestrial surface maybe a liquid Ocean World a magma ocean world or a super critical ocean world so these are very very different structures with a lot of different implications for habitability and interior processes so how do we narrow down which one is the most plausible we have to look at its atmosphere so this was from sorry I don't have it cited here but M medus it on 2023 so the transmission spectroscopy revealed the first detection of methane and CO2 in this type of exop planet ever and that's exciting because for some reason there's this missing methane problem where we see methane in a lot of solar system atmospheres but we're not finding them a whole lot in exop pen atmospheres so finally we found methane out there somewhere and there was also a non detection of ammonia carbon monoxide and water and so this paper said that these results are consistent with a hyen world that would be a temperate Global liquid ocean world that has a hydrogen dominated atmosphere and they also said they have potential evidence of dimethyl sulfide that would be a biomarker as it is produced by algae and phytol Plankton here on Earth but of course to really know what's the most plausible structure we have to check against all those other models before we say for sure that's going to be a Heen world so we've tested a lot of them already not we but like other k218b people um so deep atmosphere no surface case shallow atmosphere with a rocky surface shallow atmosphere with the liquid ocean and then a deep atmosphere with the magma ocean have already been tested the super critical ocean case hasn't really been tested yet but that's what we're going to talk about in this presentation so before I get into that I want to talk about the results from the previous modeling efforts so first the Deep atmosphere case so we're looking at a mini Neptune not really a tangible surface we have a layer where clouds are condensing with water and so this can explain the absence of water in the atmosphere it does explain the methane and CO2 abundances through deep atmosphere quenching but for some reason it predicts quite a bit of ammonia and Co compared to the non detection in the observations so it can't perfectly explain the observations yet now for the hyen world cases there are two subcategories explored here so first we have a lifeless hen World a liquid ocean there's nothing in there unfortunately um so no life yet but this does not have nearly enough methane to explain the observations it' be destroyed through photolysis and oxidizing reactions and so doesn't really match the observations we don't really see this in the race anymore now for an inhabited hen world the inhabitants are considered to be some kind of Arcane microbes right so this can explain the abundances of methane and CO2 but there has to be methane coming from the ocean perhaps from these microbes but the thing about a liquid ocean world is that it has to have a very thin hydrogen atmosphere to make sense with the mass and radius constraints but this exoplanet is very very close to its hostar about 0.15 Au away so closer than Mercury and since it's so close and the atmosphere would be so thin that atmosphere would be stripped away from the extreme ultraviolet radiation so something would have to be replenishing the hydrogen we know that volcanoes replenish hydrogen but we don't really expect volcano here so there has to be something else replenishing the hydrogen lastly it's also expected to experience a steam runaway greenhouse a hydrogen dominated atmosphere will have a lot of collision induced absorption this drives up the surface temperature and it enters that runaway greenhouse State a lot quicker than say a nitrogen dominated atmosphere like Earth so we have a very very unstable climate here and we need a lot more explanations to really see if this is a feasible scenario now the rocky planet case we're not even looking at that anymore it's not even possible um so it would be way too dense to match the mass and the radius it would have to have a very very thick atmosphere of at least a thousand bars so it wouldn't even be a super Earth anymore it' have to be like a mini Neptune but yeah this one's out of the race unfortunately now the magma ocean case this would be a mini Neptune that has a silicon hit magma melt at the bottom so this could explain the non  detection of ammonia and of water the nitrogen would be very soluble in the silicate melt so it would stay in that layer of magma instead of entering the upper atmosphere but it also predicts why do oh no it's not layer okay that's okay it predicts a lot of carbon monoxide as well along with the CO2 and so again given the non  detection we still need an explanation for that so now the super critical ocean case thinking back to that liquid ocean case where it was very unstable we would need that deeper atmosphere to maintain the atmosphere and we had that super runaway greenhouse state so all those factors together will drive a surface ocean to become super critical and in if it were super critical it' be what we call a stratified mini Neptune so like a smaller version of Neptune but it has a layer of super critical hydrogen and water that are mixing together a layer of clouds where water is condensing and then a hydrogen dominated atmosphere we have some traces of helium but why haven't we done this before as you can see there's no clear boundary between the ocean and the atmosphere unlike a liquid ocean in a regular atmosphere they're mixing together so that makes things a bit more difficult photochemical models don't account for interactions between a hydrogen atmosphere and a supercritical water layer so instead of photochemical models we adapt with geochemical models and we want to explore the geochemistry of a possible super critical ocean we model an ocean in equilibrium as we expect that a super critical ocean would have very high temperatures enough to be in equilibrium and then we model the ratios of methane to CO2 and Co to CO2 and both the liquid and the gas phases and we want to see if that gaseous speciation is going to match the observations at all so first we begin with the ref prop database we just plot the saturation boundary of water here's a phase diagram where we have an inverted y  axis so as we Ascend it's basically like ascending in the atmosphere and the bottom kind of represents the surface then we use the aqua equation of State we generate pressure temperature profiles at surface pressure of 1 kilobar 2 kilobar and 3 kilobar then at surface temperatures between 100° C and 1,000° C at every degree so technically there's like 900 profiles here but we just show 10 of them then we use the Deep earth water model to get the equilibrium constants and Henry's law constants which will tell us about the speciation so here the red stars represent where we do the aquous calculations and then the red circles represent where we do do the gaseous calculations and if we take a closer look at this pH diagram there's actually two scenarios represented here so if we're looking at these profiles that go in the liquid phase and then intersect the boundary that represents a liquid water ocean interface so just your typical liquid ocean atmosphere on top we can easily do the calculations at that interface if we're looking at the profiles that go from the super critical phase then Vapor then inter a boundary the boundary then represents a cloud layer and we have to do this of course because there's no boundary between the atmosphere and the ocean so the next location we can do the calculations are at the cloud interface where the cloud represents another liquid region we also need to know the hydrogen concentration to do the calculations so from Mass radius constraints formation modeling interior modeling um we have two n member cases for the inventory of hydrogen and water so the first one says we have 0.02% of hydrogen and helium 50% water then 2% of hydrogen helium and 18% water this gives us pretty big range I might say of about5 to 42 moles of hydrogen per kilogram of water for the concentration we are working on constraining that a little bit more but so far that's what we got so first with the aquous speciations so each set of colors that represents the 1 kilobar 2 kilobar then 3 kilobar curves respectively and that black dash line represents the observed ratio from the transmission spectroscopy so there's the aquous speciation and then we have the gash speciation so they're not very different and that's what we expect we look at the gash speciation to compare with the atmospheric observations well it's kind of hard to see the range of error here there is sort of gray region around the black dash line but um that gives the temperature range of about 715 to 1165 Kelvin to match our observations we then do the co to CO2 speciation so instead of using hydrogen as a parameter here this is instead set by The observed CH4 to CO2 ratio because it's a lot better constrained as you can see oh well you can't see but below that black dash line everything below that is the region of eror so that's pretty big but at the very least it gives us an upper temperature limit of about less than 973 Kelvin to match our observations so putting them together we have a little happy super critical Water World here it's still in the running um so putting them together we have a temperature range of about 715 to 973 Kevin critical point of water is at 646 Kevin so this tells us that a super critical ocean is indeed possible on k218b is it still habitable well that's like 500 Degrees cus so at least from what we know right now here on Earth um it's unlikely to have life at least familiar to Earth it could have some kind of weird other life that we don't know about but as far as we know probably not not habitable but it's still a very exotic environment to explore I mean a global super critical water ocean so how does that fit in with all the other models well first we look at the methane of CO2 speciation if it's somehow so much less than what the observations say maybe we can have that super Earth with the liquid ocean with no life in it but of course we have a lot more scenarios that do match the observation so then we ask is there carbon monoxide and if not then that describes our super critical water ocean case here if yes we got to ask is there ammonia and if yes maybe it's the mini Neptune if not maybe we have that silicate magma Ocean or that super Earth that does have a liquid ocean with some kind of methane coming from the ocean so there's a lot of work still to be done to really see what this planet is like what's the work that we're going to do we will have to model the nitrogen species iation the reason why we didn't do it here is because we don't know a lot of additional variables such as the pH of the ocean low PH will have a lot more ammonia production high pH will have a lot more ammonium production so we'll have to consider that we also don't know how much nitrogen there is I mean atmospheric nitrogen doesn't show up in the infrared so we have to find some way to quantify how much there is and lastly ammonia is a lot more soft soluble than those carbon species so it's expected to condense in that cloud layer and we'll have to figure out some way of you know how much is condensing but lots of exciting work and I'll leave you with my conclusion so a cold liquid water ocean is inconsistent with my equilibrium calculations not mine sorry our um and a super critical water ocean is instead possible between this temperature range I'm not saying that it is for sure a super critical water ocean but um it's definitely something that's still in the running that we still need to consider and hopefully in the future we'll get a much better constrained Co mixing ratio to really minimize that region of air thank you so much for [Applause] listening hey Cindy thanks for the fabulous talk and all this great work I was wondering what your interpretation of the dimethyl sulfide uh detection is based on your geochemical modeling assuming that it's actually there my interpretation um let's see I don't have much confidence in the dimethyl sulfide um let's see if I can go back to that figure uh I believe in the transmission spectroscopy a bunch of like biomarkers were tested and they kind of just see which ones match the best but the paper kind of cites a lot of marginal evidence potential evidence and I think in general I personally feel like it's probably not there I of course could be wrong but I think there's a lot of other papers suggesting it's probably not there but maybe maybe who knows yeah cool thank you uh hi I'm I'm Veronica hegine from Cornell um are there a um future uh J J wst um observations planned um and how is that going to um uh help you uh further reine um your uh testing of of of the different models yeah so there are future observations planned and I think mainly we're really hoping it constrains that ammonia mixing ratio and carbon monoxide mixing ratio because I mean the difference between a lot of these structures oh sorry let me go back to that flowchart depends on whether or not it's actually there but maybe there's just low levels and it hasn't been detected yet so it will definitely make a huge difference in deciding which one of these will be a lot more narrow and um yeah we'll definitely have to refine our models to see if it can match those constrained observations good okay thank you all right thank you than while Austin's getting settled I will introduce him so Austin we is going to talk about continuous habitable zone predictions for habitable world's Observatory Target [Music] Stars okay can you hear me okay right yeah hi everyone Austin we sixth year graduate student at ASU um yeah so talking about continuous habitable zones um for uh habitable worlds Observatory all right so first I guess I'll just kind of describe what hit worlds Observatory is or hwo um so here you can see um the louar a concept design um so lir and habex um were Mission Concepts that kind of inspired what hwl will be um so not an actual image of hwo we don't know what it's going to look like yet but maybe something like this um and so this will be NASA's next um Flagship astrophysics mission after the Roman Space Telescope um it's going to be a six meter class uh UV Optical and uh infrared uh direct Imaging telescope um with a chronograph so it'll block out the light from the star with the chronograph and then hopefully be able to see the planets around it um and so it'll have a goal of um surveying the habitable zones of around 100 um sunlike stars so these are FG and K spectral type stars um and then hopefully um characterize uh spect spectroscopically characterize the atmospheres of 25 um Rocky habitable zone planets um and so just to give you an idea of the massive um observational and literal costs that will be associated with each planet um for the habex and lir um reports they set an upper uh limit on the integration time um for observations of 60 days uh so it's going to be sitting there and staring at one planet uh for potentially months at a time so just a massive cost just to be able to maybe characterize the atmospheres of a planet One Planet so here's uh just a summary overview of um kind of a preliminary Target list for hwo so this comes from the exoplanet exploration program Mission star list um and so there's total sample of 164 stars as you can see mostly FG and K stars there were like three M stars that did did fit their criteria though um and then separated into three different tiers where tier a Stars uh will be the most accessible uh have the most accessible um habitable zones for this six meter class telescope and then progressively worse as you go down into here or requiring better technology um uh yeah and so the prioriti this current prioritization uh is based off of the casting at all 19 93 uh habitable zone limits kind of like the first habitable zone uh limits uh for the Sun and then those are scaled uh by the postar Luminosity for non solar targets and so importantly and I'll get into this in a second here uh this prioritization does not consider how the hital Zone depends on the effect of temperature of the hostar and also does not consider the age of the Star right so yeah we have a large sample of stars and hopefully planets and a just ridiculously high observational cost per uh Target and so if our hope is to detect life on these planets um we want to PRI prioritize those systems or planets uh by those most likely to host detectable life um and so to do that I'll be talking about continuous habitable zones but first I should probably Define what I mean when I say habitable zone here um so I'm always going to be talking about the circumstellar liquid water habitable zone uh so assuming an earthlike Planet so Rocky with sufficient atmosphere uh if it's in a certain range of installation uh it will um it could have liquid water on its surface um but we often think of this the hone as this static thing that just exists around any given star but if it's not static it's going to evolve over time as the star evolves and the planet too so uh in my analysis I consider the continuous hone so here we have a plot of um the hone radius on the waxes versus time and we see as the star evolves the habitable zone moves progressively out outward as the star gets brighter um so we can Define The Continuous habital Zone as the orbital area remaining continuously within the habitable zone for some length of time um but how long in the habitable zone is long enough is really the important question so as with most things uh we can look to the Earth for answers uh about this so we have we have atmospheric O2 uh versus billions of years ago um and around two billion years after the formation of Earth or 2.5 billion years ago the great oxidation event occurred where photosynthetic organisms um produced a significant amount of oxygen and potentially produced a detectable signature in Earth's atmosphere um and so if you were just in interested in maybe like uh detecting disequilibrium chemistry in an atmosphere you could probably go to an earlier time than this um but this kind of gives a conservative uh length of time for how long a planet should be in the habitable zone uh in order for life to arise and then make a detectable impact on the atmosphere so we can Define the the two gig continuous hital zone or the chc2 as I'll refer to it from here as the orbital area remaining continuously within the habitable zone for two billion years or longer uh but so in my analysis what hital zone models am I actually using um so here we have Stellar effective temperature uh and the effective flux incident on the planet relative to Earth um and the uh red and green lines uh correspond to the moist moist greenhouse and maximum Greenhouse habitable zone boundaries from coer appu all 2013 um so these are two of the most commonly used inner and outer edge boundaries um and are the most similar to those used in the habex lir and uh uh hwo Mission star list um but crucially these are defined with with respect to the effect temperature of the star and we can see that they relatively move outward as you go to lower effective temperatures um but then the third uh line here the blue line um is from tbad dool 2023 and this defines the water condensation limit um and this uh functions as the initial um inner habital Zone boundary um so once the star enters onto the main sequence this defines that initial habitable zone boundary if a planet once uh its host star is on the main sequence is in interior to this line uh the blue line um it will not be able to have uh water condense onto its surface so after that initial magma ocean cools the water will be uh in the atmosphere and if it's interior to this there's just too much uh uh incident flux um to be able to have the water condense and so it will stay in the atmosphere until it is slowly lost to space over time but if uh at the uh beginning of the main sequence uh the planet is outside of this line um then the water will um rain down onto the surface and be able to form oceans uh and so I have plotted here uh modern uh Earth and early Earth and modern Venus and early Venus and we can see even though modern Earth is interior to that blue line now um early Earth when the sun was dimmer was outside of that line and so of course we have oceans um but Venus uh was never uh outside of that water condensation limit and so if these results are to to be believed that means that Venus was never able to form oceans uh on its surface on its surface um and so this is really important to include when uh doing any type of hone analysis because it basically tells you planets can and cannot form oceans on their surfaces and so uh I combine these hital Zone models uh with uh teego Stellar Evolution models um to model The habal Zone over time and uh uh this is inside of a basan framework that I use to then come uh predict the probability that any given radius around um a star is with in the chc2 so just kind of a simple description of what this model does so we take the prior probability that the orbital radius is in ch2 so this is based off of the Stellar Evolution models combined with the H models um and then we have the likelihood of the models given the measured Stellar mass metallicity or composition uh and age and so essentially just multiplying the prior and the likelihood together we then get our posterior likelihood which is the uh probability that any given radius is in the chc2 so what does this look like for the sun um so here we have yeah probability of any radius being in C2 on the y  axis and then the distance from the Star um and also plotted here we have the uh orbital radi of uh Venus Earth and Mars um and so without so here I'm not considering the age of the Sun so assuming we don't know the age so it can have any age between the beginning of the main sequence and the end um and kind of get this like gaan distribution for the probability um and we can see here that the that this would predict that Mars actually has a higher probability of being in the chc2 than Earth and this is just because of based on these habitable zone definitions over the full main sequence lifetime Mars would spend more time in the habitable zone in Earth but once we consider the age of the sun which you know really well um know it better than this I just use um an astrophysical estimate of the sun's age uh just it's more relevant for what I'm doing um but yeah so we know it really well and so it goes from being kind of this like weird looking gaan to basically just a top hat function because we know the mass uh the composition and the age exactly for the Su um yeah and so but yeah once we consider the age then we can see that Earth is given 100% probability and of being in the chc2 as expected and Mars is too but that's for other reasons unrelated to the star all right but so for uh exoplanets um and for their host Stars uh we we don't know the mass uh composition and age exactly and for the age in particular we maybe have a rough idea of it but in most cases we it's fairly uncertain um and so taking into account those other uncertainties we get more of a a daan distribution um for uh exit Planet host stars um and so the these are two stars that are in the hwo sample um and uh yeah so for the one on the left here Kappa One CTI uh G5 star um has a relatively young age about 1.25 billion years based off of my estimates um so that would give it a maximum probability of around 40% that a radius is in the chc2 um and really if we that age was more certain it would have a 0% probability because it's not even two billion years old and then for charara G zero star um has an a mean age above that two billion year mark so has a much higher maximum probability of around 90% so we can see how much the age uh influences these distributions and it's really critical for this work um yeah so how do we take these distributions then and turn them into a usable number um that we can then use to like rank a system or a planet so if we knew planets in these systems we could just say oh is that this orbital radius so it has this probability but for the hwo sample we actually don't know um we haven't discovered any uh habitable zone terrestrial planets around these Stars yet so what we can do so first I should discuss just quickly the inner working angle so when you're using a coronograph um obviously you cannot see anything inside uh interior to the edge of the coronograph so you have a inner working angle that defines where you can see um inside that system um and so um if we were to just say uh the inner work the angle is about here so taking into account how far the star is from us um what we can do is integrate over this probability distribution outside of that inner working angle and kind of come up with then an effective chc2 range um to compare between different stars um yeah and so actually for these two stars uh they these are two of the best in the hwo sample the full habitable zone will be visible um even with the most conservative estimates of what the inner working angle will be um so yeah as you can see the chc2 completely lies outside of the inner working angle here uh so if we do this integration over the probability distributions we can then see that Chara uh has a much higher uh effective chc2 range than uh cap one stud does mostly just based off of the age here and so we could use those to then rank them and say you know Char is probably a better uh candidate to uh spend more time looking at than Capital One Saidi is all right yeah and then just uh summary and next steps here uh so using the C2 probabilities we can further prioritize observations uh by considering those planets or stars that are most likely to host detectable life um and so for both my work and for just studies of habit ility comparative planetology or just in general accurate and precise ages are critical and is really one of the areas that we are most lacking in in astrophysics right now um because if you don't know the age you really just can't put anything you're observing into context yeah so this is still currently a work in progress um I've done these uh estimates for all of the main sequence uh so dwarf stars that are in the hwo sample um but I'm currently expanding our stellar Revolution catalog to be able to include those more evolved phases uh so we can include the sub giants that are in the sample um and so I'll publish the results for the full 1644 star uh list along with estimates of the mass and age for all of those Stars yeah and yeah I'll leave this up and take questions thank you [Music] thank you thank you hi um this is hpaa media from ASU um this is a totally naive question because I just do like little baby solar system objects what causes so much like uncertainty in the ages of the Stars like what makes those uh measurements so difficult uh yeah so so for my estimates I am just using my stellar uh Evolution model to fit the measured properties so obviously there's the associated uncertainties in the mass and composition of the stars um and also I'm just using 1D models so there's only so accurate that a 1D stero of relution model can be if you want to be really accurate you could use 3D models but that would that would take forever to run for even one model for a single star and so there's just a lot of uncertainty in the evolution models um due to simplification a in the physics um and there's also a very limited number of uh independent methods for the measuring um ages so you can do it based off of dry chronology so basically you measure how fast the star is spinning over time it will spin down due to Magnetic breaking um and so that can give you an estimate but that really only works for young stars um if it's in a cluster um you can get much better estimates because you can kind of do this like fitting tacons but you can do it for a huge number of stars and get a much better estimate of what the age is um but that also mostly just works for young Stars uh so really the problem is that we don't have a lot of great ways to measure ages precisely for older stars um yeah cool thank you that was great hi really interesting talk I'm benu Vegas from here at Cornell um my question relates to your kind of the setup of your prior using that two billion year age cut off so um how sensitive is your output and your model uh to that initial input so given the understanding that that's the point where sure we see oxygen but prior to that we have a billion well depending on who you believe up to a one and a half billion years of life that could be producing something detectable that's not oxygen so how uh sensitive are your results to that initial input yeah uh so they are going to be pretty sensitive to it obviously yeah the two billion year mark it's it's fairly arbitrary uh it's like an educated arbitrary guess um but yeah so um the biggest I think issue is going to be as you if say say you go down and you just make it like 500 million years you're going to have a lot of the Stars reaching a maximum like 100% probability like most of them are going to then be in that and so it's going to be a lot less informative uh it's much easier for a Star to have spent 500 million years in the habitable zone than two billion years and so really I guess the thinking here is really just that you know by two billion years on Earth there's lots of detectable signals in the atmosphere uh and so this is like a conservative estimate saying that if you know your planet's been in the hital zone for 2 billion years it's either got life and it's detectable or it doesn't so yeah uh so that's why we go with that conservative uh two billion years and not something much younger but you it's very easy to change it if a younger age would be preferred [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

aerosols on exoplanet atmospheric retrievals mic working no not working sorry thank you all right now can you hear me cool awesome thank you so much can I grab quicker thank you um yeah so hi I'm Lily renthal um I just finished my first semester of graduate school at University of Arizona's lunar and planetary laboratory and yeah today I'm going to be talking about aerosols in exoplanet atmospheres um so when we're thinking about on is this not okay cool thank you all right pointer is now working so uh yeah when we're thinking about um exoplanets in the context of astrobiology like at a conference such as is this we think a lot about atmosph atmospheric bios signatures which are um I'm sure you all are aware atmospheric species uh that can be detected in the atmospheres of exoplanets that could indicate um the possibility of Life on those planets um and uh we are able to study exoplanets um through a method known as transmission spectroscopy again I'm sure a few people have already covered this today um and we can this is really our main method for constraining the comp positions of uh exoplanet atmospheres um and potentially detecting bios signatures just because like remote sensing is our is our option for uh these bodies um and uh transmission spectroscopy Works in that the um the planet transits in front of its host star the staright shines through the planet's atmosphere and it tells us gives us a spectrum that tells us the composition of of the planet's atmosphere um and yeah so every uh molecule has uh or has distinct um spectral features and that can be uh relatively easy to pick out if you have only one uh one uh species that you're looking at um spectrally however in a system like an atmosphere where there is a mixture of various molecular molecular species it can be uh much more difficult to parse and uh it can be a challenge to kind of pick out what the components are and actually uh constrain the um the composition of of an atmosphere so in order to do that in order to get actual information about atmospheric composition out of um uh out of exoplanet uh Spectra we use a method known as atmospheric retrieval which um involves taking our observations and running a bunch of models based on different parameters and essentially going through and sort of determining uh the most statistically likely um scenario uh for our ma our um observation through which um Which models um match up the best with our observe Spectra um and so that is how we can get um beautiful Spectra like this one from JW jwst and uh there was I think Cindy showed one earlier that was also really beautiful um you can sort of pick out the important molecular features that are going on and that um yeah once we get matched to a to a model that sort of gives us our best fit so give that transmission spectroscopy is our method for you know for um really our only method for studying exoplanet atmospheres and potentially detecting bio signatures uh we end up in a sort of classic If You Give a Mouse a Cookie situation where uh if you give an astronomer a transmission Spectrum they're going to ask for a retrieval Pipeline and when they ask for a retrieval pipeline they're going to want that retrieval pipeline to accurately and robustly represent the conditions and um uh parameters that are present in an exoplanet atmosphere so that kind of leads us to the question of what are some of those processes that need to be accurately and robustly um represented in these models that could have an an impact on our ability to characterize um these atmospheres and this this uh slide is a little bit of a hint um we're talking about clouds and aerosols generally um and we really don't know a lot about clouds we don't we really don't know clouds at all uh in the in the context of um atmospheres and exoplanet atmospheres um but we do know that they are ubiquitous in exoplanets um as well as solar system bodies so they're they're all over the place um our modeling of them as now is very simplistic um we really don't have a full understanding of how they impact Spectra and our ability to derive information from Spectra um one of the you know kind of a one of the impact that we do kind of are able to see already um in this cartoon from Barstow um is you know the clouds kind of raise the lower part of the spectrum um and prevent us from seeing deeper into the atmosphere and that can you know block out some of these like important little little spectral features that we're seeing over here um so we do know they they make it harder for us to see um so really what it comes down to is so our ability to um gain accurate information from Rich revals um and you know constrain the uh compositions of atmospheres and the uh potential to find bios signatures um that is dependent on how well we can um we can model these parameters um and so how can we improve our U models of um these aerosols in atmospheres in order to improve our retrieval methods um one approach is we can look to our neighbors in the solar system we got a lot of uh nice nice planetary friends pretty close by a lot of them have uh significant aerosol presence in their atmospheres like um we got Titan Mars Venus Saturn uh Pluto um all of these and of course solar system bodies have the incredible advantage that we are able to study them in situ so we can establish ground Truth uh for what's going on in their atmospheres um and this kind of leads into the work that that I've just gotten started doing um we are using uh the vast array of pre existing um occultation observations of solar system bodies to kind of establish a catalog of ground Truth for those atmospheres and then uh compare that that ground truth to um our models of these atmospheres to see just how well our models are currently representing what we actually know to be going on in these solar system bodies um so we're kind I'm kind of getting started with with these two with Mars and Titan uh eventually we're going to move on to the others uh just to fully um have a full comprehensive catalog of uh the solar system and what what uh the atmospheres of these these uh closer to home bodies are doing and if it's accurately represented in our models so there's a lot of data out there um I'm getting started with uh these I've really just been starting to dig into the maven data um and I think yeah it's it's really kind of amazing that we have this sort of incredible untapped resource for um doing this kind of exploration um because yeah a lot of people have worked on these missions and uh made this possible and I think like I know the theme of this uh this conference is standing on the shoulders of giants um I think it's equally if not more valuable to stand on the shoulders of a whole bunch of regularized guys um like like like the people who uh every all the people who worked on these missions and who have made this data um available and uh to to then further our um our studies of of other things so yeah really grateful that this exists as a resource and that I can start digging into it um so yeah just getting started on some of this uh this is some preliminary data exploration from Maven iubs instrument uh which is a Mars am Mars mission um we are seeing uh in terms of number density of aerosols um kind of a little bit of a mess it's kind of all over the place uh it's not constant as some uh models would assume it to be uh it's not even super l there's just a lot going on um and it's important to to recognize this and to see kind of the comp the complexity that is not being represented in models that is present in real real data um and yeah so this is just from the the first campaign from Maven so there's a whole bunch more data to dig into there um and yeah it's it's really um it's valuable to see you know what trends we can find and how how our models might be uh not representing them well and how we can improve so the second part of this uh project will then be taking what we've learned from these solar system aerosol profiles um and the ground Truth uh and models that we we establish and um applying that to our parameterizations of exoplanet uh aerosols and um again kind of validating how our models work and if we are indeed getting you know as much information as we can out of our our Spectra um and then yeah to to wrap up um we currently are understanding of aerosols in the atmospheres of exoplanets um is needs needs to be expanded if we are to derive the most accurate um information from those Spectra about composition and uh structure of of exoplanet atmospheres um and it's really exciting that we have such a wide array of pre existing um data to um kind of start with and use as our ground troop and yeah there's a lot of exciting work uh to be done and I'm looking forward to to getting into it um so yeah got some references I want to thank my adviser Professor Tyler Robinson at University of Arizona plus uh the habab group uh Sierra Zera and Arno um the France Arizona Institute for Global Grand challenges for funding appreciate that I like to get paid um I'm grateful for everybody down at LPL at University of Arizona um and I'm really grateful for the organizers of this conference for putting together such a fantastic event and giving me the opportunity to talk about my as of now very fledgling work on this topic so thank you so much um also if any of you out there are U familiar with any of the data sets I mentioned I would love to talk to you because I'm trying to find uh ways to reduce some a lot of that data so if you if you know about it talk to me um yeah thank you I'd love to take any questions hey carata Hopkins uh I'm wondering if you've thought about using any of the data from the um Cosmic dust analyzer on board Cassini yeah I think we are going to use some of that yeah when we get into the Cassini data for Titan and Saturn yeah cool that's yeah one of the things uh Steven coffee from um Columbia University and I'm wondering if there's like clear cut definitions of the differences between like clouds and hazes is it like the opacity of like clouds are completely opaque and hazes are not or uh they are it's kind of a a situation of um how they're formed so clouds are formed through condensation that's how they're they're um identified hazes um are formed through photochemical processes um and then dusts are like aolan like wind driven uh um aerosols so that's kind of how they're divided it's it's by sort of uh their mechanism through which they're formed yeah it's a good good question last call thanks for that talk Fletch from the University of New South Wales um if you skipped your preliminary results graph really quickly I'm just wondering uh you see there's two um lines that appear kind of linear in that data are those like balance of detection of that instrument or what is causing that um that is a really fantastic question and at this point I do not know I'm only just starting to get familiar with this data set so um that's something I would be very interested to to figure out as I go forward yeah excellent yeah thank you all right that was our last talk for the session we have Panera waiting for you outside salads and sandwiches we're back at 1:30 for Ice Ice Baby is it charged

session um this next talk session is icy worlds or Ice Ice Baby um the first talk today I'm sorry I'm just laughing um the first one will be from Jennifer Yak um and it she'll be talking to us about enhancing the search for life on icy ocean worlds through high pressure experimentation take it away Jennifer well thank you wait Can You Hear Me is This on okay perfect um thank you so much my name is Jennifer I'm a second year PhD student at the University of Illinois in Chicago hold on I'll fix this okay so I'm going to be talking today about high pressure experimentation specifically evolving a strain of bacteria to cope um and live under extremely high pressures okay so understanding how life evolves and survives under extreme conditions um is really important for astrobiological study as we all should know um these extreme conditions include things like high temperature low temperature high salt concentration high pressure um when we go to other worlds or other off world environments um the environment is way different than what we're going to find here um so I'm again talking about high pressure Earth supports life as far as we know up to 125 megap pascals of pressure this is like the bottom of the ocean so the life we find at the bottom of the ocean is generally 110 125 megapascals um that it's living at but High Press environments are going to be relevant to the icy moons that we're currently researching such as Europa it's thought that europa's sub surface ocean is 110 to 260 megapascals so this is going to be way higher than life um as we know it can tolerate and then Titan is up to 800 megapascals at the bottom of its subsurface ocean so again way higher than Life as we know it and then Enceladus as well 1.5 to 10 megapascal so a little bit lower but still high pressure um so I want to talk a little bit about some previous experiments that we we have done we used the bacteria shanella onid Denis and we put it under 150 megap pascals of pressure we did two different experiments we did one at 15 minutes and we did one at 2 hours both of those experiments yielded survivors and then we did transcript omic on the 15 minute experiment so our results from the transcriptomic are showing up regulation of DNA repair genes which is to be expected so organisms that are known extremophiles or organisms that can live in really extreme conditions um they utilize DNA rep uh repair mechanisms to cope with those extreme conditions and survive so this was expected we also saw changes in fatty acid biosynthesis regulations so we saw a little upregulation of Branch chain um fatty acid biosynthesis again this is to be expected um the branch chain fatty acids would be incorporated into the membrane to give the cell membrane fluidity under Hy pressure um and then we also saw a downregulation of the ribosome sorry recycling Factor this just means that the cells after 15 minutes of pressure were starting to turn off protein production so it looked like their focus was more on protecting the DNA and protecting their membrane than actually building proteins um we did longer term experiments with shanella onid densis for 2 weeks at 150 megapascals and we had no survivors from that experiment so my research is hoping to expand on this by not just throwing this bacteria under extremely high pressure like straight off the bat I'm trying to make it evolve to cope with these really high pressures so I'm doing this with a technique called adaptive laboratory Evolution um and this is pretty straightforward you take an environmental condition that you want to evolve your organism to so in my case it's going to be high pressure but you could do this with anything like temperature high temperature low temperature salt any extreme condition so you take your organism you put it in that condition and then you slowly increase or decrease it so in my case I'm doing high pressure so I put it in at a low pressure and I slowly am increasing the pressure um this is going to hopefully promote the cells to uh become more fit to this condition so hopefully we'll get a a mutation that allows the organisms to survive that condition um and that will be reproduced throughout the the population and then we will have an evolved strain of bacteria that can handle this high pressure um so bacteria reproduce really quickly this is why we're using bacteria to do this the organism I'm using shanella onid densis it has a doubling time of 40 hours so that means in 40 hours that population will double in size um so hopefully we will get some mutations fairly really quickly that will allow it to cope with this pressure uh Al or the Adaptive laboratory Evolution experiments also gives us insight into how these organisms evolve or adapt to these conditions oops okay so to do this uh we use a custombuilt high pressure panel made by hardwood engineering um it's an air driven hydraulic pressure [Music] system this is what controls the pressure pressure it gets pressurized through this panel here and then the pressure gets put into the vessels these are the vessels that the experiment actually goes into uh this system is unique from other high pressure systems because it can go to extremely high pressures we can reach two Giga uh 2 gigap pascals and our vessel is it can hold more uh culture than most other high pressure systems so our system can hold about 15 milliliters of culture where other systems can hold maybe a mill tops um and then we also make in our lab these uh fluorinated ethylene propylene bags this is like a Teflon bag so it can withstand the pressure while it's in the vessel and this is what we put our um bacteria culture in okay so the goal of my experiment here is to evolve a strain of bacteria to withstand 150 megap pascals or higher of pressure and not just withstand it I don't want it to just simp simply survive I want it to be able to grow and reproduce um under this pressure so how I'm setting this experiment up I'm using again chianella onid Denis mr1 so this is the same bacteria that we used in our previous experiments um I started this I started two different um experiments basically I started one at exponential phase and then one at stationary growth phase and then for those of you here who are not biologists we can think of exponential phase as this organism has all the resources it needs to reproduce very quickly so it's trying its main focus basically is to reproduce and make as much bacteria as possible and then the stationary growth phase this is when those resources start to run out and the bacteria switches from trying to reproduce as quickly as possible to just simply surviving so it turns on a whole different Suite of genes we call these the stress response genes um and I I wanted to do this um just just to see how these two different growth phases affect the initial uh pressure tolerance all of our previous experiments were done at um exponential I'm sorry stationary phase so I wanted to see how they handled it at exponential phase um so I grew cultures in a broth media I put them in those little Teflon bags and then I started the experiment at 15 megap pascals of pressure and then here's just a little schematic of how the experiment works so it stays in the high pressure chamber for two weeks at at the pressure I take it out and then I sample that culture um I do some protein quantitation I do some cell counting I do different microscopy um viability essays different staining techniques which I'll talk about later I also start a backup culture um just to make sure that this uh bacteria actually survive that pressure and in case anything were to go wrong in the pressure chamber if a bag to break I have something I can go back on um from that culture that came out of the pressure I take 1 ml of that samp or of that culture and I start a new bag with it and mix it with 3 milliters of fresh media so I basically take it out of the pressure give it some more food so it can continue to grow and then put it back in the chamber and then we put it back in the pressure chamber at a slightly higher pressure okay so I said I wanted to make sure that this bacteria was actually growing Under Pressure this is one of the goals I don't want it to just simply sit there in a dormant State surviving the pressure and waiting till it comes out to grow so one of the things I do is a protein essay um so this graph here is just showing the protein growth during these two we periods under the pressure so on our x axis we have the pressure of each experiment in megap pascals and on the Y AIS I have the protein um concentration of growth so this is how much protein it gained while it was under pressure for 2 weeks um the blue bars are going to represent the exponential phase experiment and the purple bars are going to represent our stationary phase experiment um so we can see in the beginning the stationary phase was doing much better at coping with the pressure and growing Under Pressure um but as the experiment continues to go on it evens out with the exponential SP okay and then oh this looks different okay sorry this looks different on my computer sorry guys I'll still walk you through it okay so this is another graph showing the protein growth Under Pressure so on the left side we have the exponential phase on the right side we have the stationary phase um that is supposed to be two separate graphs uh the x axis has our MEAP pascals or pressure in MEAP pascals and and then the Y AIS has our protein concentration after the experiment in micrograms per milliliter so we have the circles here are going to be our control group these are the ones that are not pressurized and then the triangles we have our experimental group um what I also call the survivors because they have survived the pressure um and as we can see the control group is doing much better at growing outside of pressure than the pressurized ones but I just want to make a note that the pressurized ones are still growing and they're probably growing a little bit slower because they're under extreme pressure okay sorry this is all messed up um okay so we want to measure um prote or we want to measure growth of the bacteria that are under pressure again this is one of the goals we do this in several different ways so we do protein quantitation um for this I use the BCA protein aay method it's a color metric um protein aay that uses a spectr photometer to determine the protein concentration in a sample I also do microscopic measurements so I take the sample or a sample of the culture before it goes under pressure and I look at it under the microscope and take measurements of how big the cells are and then I take a sample of the culture after it comes out of pressure and again I take measurements of how big this cell are and what they look like so what we're seeing on the top picture is before it goes under pressure and the bottom picture is after it comes out of pressure so we're seeing that these cells get longer more filamentous um a more chain like pattern and it's thought that the pressure um so the cells when they're in pressure they're doing everything to grow they're building biomass we see that they're building biomass with the proteins um they're doing everything to get ready to divide but it's thought that those stress response genes are turning off the gene that makes the septum that physically divides the cell so it's thought that because they're stressed out and Under Pressure they can do everything to divide except physically divide okay and then we also do cell counting and we use the fluorescent stain dappy to do this um dappy readily enters the cell and it binds with the DNA um and it will make the cells fluores under the microscope so we can count how many cells there are so if we have more cells in our culture that comes out of high pressure then we did that went in then they obviously are reproducing Under Pressure we also not only want to measure growth we want to make sure our cells are metabolically active under pressure and that they're alive or viable um and to do this I start um that backup culture in the tryptic so broth media and if they start if they survive the pressure and they're growing that media will turn turbid so the bag on the right here that is going to be turbid those are cells that you're actually seeing the bacteria and then the bag on the left is um It's not turbid nothing grew in that one okay we also use another stain it's called keline am this stain will take bacteria that are metabolically active this die works by readily going into the cell through the membrane and if the cell is active it's producing an enzyme called esterase so esterase will bind with that celum D molecule it will cleave off a piece of that and then that Dy will start to um flues under the microscope so the cells that we can see in here are metabolically active and then another one that we are working with is the live D viability stain um this one works by entering the cell through a compromised membrane so if there's like a hole in the membrane or a pore in the membrane that Dy will go in it will bind with the DNA and it will flag that cell fluorescently um our problem with this is It's thought that Under Pressure the cells develop pores in the membrane or little holes in the membrane that are not necessarily deadly that that cell might be able to repair and still keep on Surviving so we are currently trying to see if this is actually going to work with our experiments or not okay so our next steps for this um I'm currently working on doing some genomics to track any changes to the genome we have a genome of this bacteria annotated already um that has not been pressurized so I'll be able to compare my genome from my um bacteria that's currently under pressure and see if there is any changes in it if there's any type of evolution happening um also shanella in the shanella family there's another species called chianella btha it lives at the bottom of the ocean so this is one of those organisms that can tolerate 110 mpas or 125 mpas already so I would also like to if there are genetic changes to my organism my strain I would like to compare that to the Genome of shanella btha and see if those changes are the same or if they've come up with different ways to adapt to to that high pressure um we are also working on transcriptomics to compare the strain that's currently under pressure with the 15minute 150 MPA experiment to see if it's turning on the same types of genes if it's using the same mechanisms to cope with that DNA uh to cope with that pressure or not and then I also want to do flow cytometry to check the accuracy of our cell countings and our different staining techniques and see if these are actually working and good techniques to use okay and then some takeaways from this so by using this Al method uh we've been able to grow the strain of bacteria at increasingly higher pressures it's currently in the high pressure chamber right now as we speak at 42 mpas it's still surviving it's still alive so it's working so far um I know we're not anywhere near 150 MPA yet but we're slowly getting there um we saw earlier that the experimental strain is glow growing slower than the control group but this is to be expected again it's thought that the pressure is making the uh decreasing the growth rate and then by using a combination of staining methods and the protein as say we are able to show that this protein is not only growing or not only surviving it's growing building biomass and reproducing under pressure and with that I just want to thank um all of you the audience I want to thank the organizers for abgr conon 2024 I'd like to thank everybody in my lab The Edge Lab at the University of Illinois in Chicago Dr Fabian kig um one of our undergrads Tai he spent countless hours with me trying to do this and working with the pressure machine um and then a special thanks to Dr Michael molaska at J uh JPL and then if anybody is interested I've heard a lot of talks earlier about microbes and bacteria and if anybody's interested in working with high pressure feel free to reach out to me my email addresses up here along with my website all right we have about two minutes for questions if you guys want to come down here hi Abby daring Georgia Tech it's a really interesting project I was just wondering I think you might have mentioned it but could you talk a little bit more about how you're sure that your cultures are staying in the exponential or stationary phase when they're there for two weeks that's a good question I did not talk about that they are not staying in exponential um because we're feeding them they're going right back into exponential as soon as we uh restart that it was more of I wanted to see at the very beginning how exponential and stationary compared to handling that initial pressure but yeah ever since that very first um two weeks they're they're all in exponential now thanks we got time for one question um very interesting talk Sarah from Michigan State uh have you seen uh biofilm formation within your cultures after applying pressure not after applying pressure um in the control groups though they do F uh form bofilm but not I haven't seen it under pressure and that might just be because they're grow growing a lot slower than the experimental groups um and maybe if they were left in longer they might form a biofilm but uh shanella does form biofilm so and you're running all your experiments under aerobic conditions right uh yeah anerobic anerobic anerobic sorry thank you give another round of applause for Jennifer [Music] okay our next talk will be from CL elbin I'm talking about Anor robic biological formation of Magan maganese oxides in the Gulf of Mexico deep hypine anoxic basins take it away Claire all right thank you Taylor all right I'm Claire I'm a fourth year PhD at georged Tech um and I'm going to talk about uh a really big collaboration with the oceans across space and time team where we went to the Gulf of Mexico dehab called Orca basin okay so microbial manganese oxidation occurs in soils and sediments as well as freshwater and Marine systems so it's pretty much everywhere and some good examples of aquatic manganese oxidation by microbes um please there we go um so in the basalts at the Lohi seed Mount um there's a very diverse group of microbial communities um that are catalyzing this um they sort of sit on top of these manganese oxide nodules that they produce and form a bofilm around it so these are sem images and remember what these look like it'll come back later uh at Caltech their tap water they were able to isolate a bacterial chemoth autotrof that uses manganese oxidation um and so what's really cool about manganese oxides is we're going from the insoluble form of Manganese 2+ to the insoluble particulate form of manganese 4+ and it turns this really nice purple color so it's very very conspicuous um these are the manganese nodules that uh these guys produce at our lab at Georgia Tech we have a very thriving happy leptothrix community in an old filter system that we don't use anymore forming lots of Manganese oxides um and perhaps the most interesting to me is the Black Sea has a suboxic basin where a lot of really fast manganese oxidation is occurring via these microbes who are thought to use even just nanomoles of oxygen to drive this reaction so overall there are quite a few different ways to form these particulate insoluble manganese oxides um and overall it's thought that this really needs oxygen to work because it's very thermodynamically difficult to form so because of that the formation of manganese oxides is thought as a really good bios signature for microbes forming it and it's also used in the sedimentary record for oxygenation on Earth but there are a few ways to form maganese oxides anerobic um and in particular it is thermodynamically feasible to do this as a microb with denitrification it just hasn't really been shown yet but it's thought to occur in anoxic Marine systems that um can support this type of metabolism why you all might want to care so I'm really more a microbiologist and I'm going to always say it's good to know what kind of metabolisms can happen on Earth so we can have legitimate real hypotheses if we're looking at stuff elsewhere so in the example of Mars there's bioavail or biologically useful nitrogen in the form of nitrate that's been found in Gail crater as well as manganese oxides um that can't be explained Alone by any sort of other um just regular chemistry going on so deep hypers Salan anoxic basins probably a good place to look for this kind of metabolism because they are eight times as saline as typical Marine seawater this is because evapora deposits open up and they form these giant hypersaline anoxic waters super super salty um don't go into to a brine pool you'll end up like this guy wouldn't recommend it but there's also a Halo Clin that is right above this brine water and there are some only in the difference of a meter very very strong geochemical changes so we went to the Orca Basin off the Gulf of Mexico this is the anomaly of salt so this is the evapora deposit and it fills this entire Basin with that super salty brine water we took an ROV and um we did you know typical ctd cast as well uh Veronica was on the ROV team and they were really cool because they went down into the brine pool and that's never been done before so Veronica you're my hero what I really like about orca Basin as well is that there is this insane peak in particulate manganese oxides so if you're thinking like a microbiologist you know I can't just look in the water and find the microbes I like to call these metabolic crumbs I can't see the microbes but I can pretty much guarantee you something biological is making this happen then you go out to see so when we're chasing metabolic crumbs for the rest of this talk I'm going to be uh focusing on this 2200 meter depth and I'm going to explain to you why so this is right at the brine seawater interface so this is right before everything gets really really weird so pH starts to have a little hump and then decreases here here uh temperature is right at this part of starting to increase this is that 8 times saline dissolved oxygen is completely gone at 2200 M and we're just starting to see that salt go crazy really interesting to me is this right here is indicating we're in the zone of denitrification so that means Oxygen's not being used nitrate is being used in its place and soluble manganese 2 is available to be used so if we overlay this um older cruise that went out there 2200 m is also that point where this particulate manganese oxide Peak occurs so very interesting spot for me to want to look at so you go out to see and then you sample stuff with all your friends on the ctd um the first thing that I did I wanted to identify manganese oxides and see if cells were hanging out around them so this is a depth profile this is the Deep brine really really yucky smelled weird too um but this is at manganese oxide Peak so you can kind of see there's already this like dark purple occurring just from 45 milliliters taken so I used a method used by a previous grad student in our lab that was developed called simultaneous staining with lbb blue this will only stain manganese 4 in the form of a manganese oxide it makes it this nice pretty blue you can point out the exact spots that these o Ides are and then you can use cyber to St stain the cells they'll turn this nice green and then you can overlay it and see if there's some collocation happening so for 2200 M for us we saw a lot of cell conglomerates looking like this you can already sort of see some minerals inside these conglomerates this is that same um exact same spot here it's uh turning blue with that manganes this is looking like where it is but this might also be magese here and then when you overlay it you can see that the manganese oxides in the cells are very very closely located if not touching and what we found overall was that manganese oxides are both present and like primarily collocated with cells at 2200 meters and this was done with two really great undergrads at Tech um and basically if you saw maganese oxide you were pretty much guaranteed to see a big clump of cells hanging around it or next to it so the next thing I wanted to do was I wanted to enrich cultures for manganese oxidation and nitrate reduction I wanted to see if I could get these bugs back in the lab to do this thing that I think they're doing so I took a lot of uh bottle cultures at SE with an anoxic overflow method basically just made sure there were no bubbles in the cold van at C where I spent all of my time I added uh dinitrogen gas to sparge out the head space and then added an oxic nitrate so this uh first set of samples and for everything else I'm talking about I was living in the glove box doing this first set of samples this first transfer was producing these kind of larger clumps of Manganese oxides which was a little bit different from what I was seeing in sichu but it was still doing something so then I did a bunch more transfers in a 2:1 ratio of nitrate to manganese 2 and kind of measured the fluxes and changes see if I could see um if they were doing what I was hoping they were doing so it looks like they are these enrich these enrichments from 2200 M are oxidizing manganese 2 to manganese uh 4 or as a manganese oxide kind of regardless of how much manganese 2 I was getting them giving them they're definitely increasing that amount I want to point out this is a nanomolar uh I don't know how well you can see this but it kind of looks like a gross snow globe at this 30 day period where you're seeing these little particles appear was also seeing that there was concurrent nitrate reduction going on so there was a lot more nitrate uh being reduced but this is probably not a pure culture yet so I think pretty much everyone was very happy to have a lot of nitrate all of a sudden so we've shown this and now we wanted to look more at the mineral itself um in particular we wanted we used um scxr D which was to get nicer photos of the microbes and then to see where exactly the minerals were and to sort of detect features we also did synchotron x ray defraction and that is to look a lot more at the mineral composition itself oh and I did this in collaboration with Ray Kai at Georgia Tech um in Dr tangs leab so back to that think back to those sem images this kind of looks like a nodule I think and there are cells all around around it forming some sort of biofilm I was really excited when I took this and I sent it to my parents and they said why are you taking photos of a nose so but the nose does have manganese Peaks so this is a manganese mineral so another type of morphology we saw a lot was this sort of stacked mineral structure with cells just kind of like stuck around this is also a manganese mineral structure we're seeing two different types of structures um but they were both manganes and they had cells so then looking at the mineral itself with that singatron xrd this is very new and I have not read enough about this to answer hard questions but uh we saw a strong manganese and iron oxide Peak with this data zooming in on the manganese oxide Peak um we're working on sort of figuring out with some control um how we can better look and see what exact type of mineral this is I think it looks a little bit like this but much more to come on that but overall maybe manganese um M2 so overall uh manganese oxides are highly associated with cells from that 2200 meter peak um I'm providing evidence for potentially a novel metabolism of Anor robic biological formation of manganese oxides that occur with nitrate draw down and the produced oxides um have cells covering them I'd say this is a pretty good potential bio signature for anerobic microbial manganese oxidation uh this is like I said very highly insoluble and so we're really looking more into the minerology and seeing if it's just very unique and different from other manganese oxides that have been recorded um and again finding hyperscaling metabolisms with these kind of funky metals and stuff is really great hypotheses for metabolisms or understanding life maybe elsewhere so what I have in progress um I've sent off some 16s uh sequencing of the transfers just to see who's there there was a secret experiment I didn't tell you about um that we did shipboard where we incubated some stuff with and without uh manganese and nitrate gave it some hpg to try to do boncat and jgi um this is really all thanks to Emily skoo who got this money but jgi is doing um micro dissection of the particles so they can just uh sequence the cells on the particles uh Miguel deare who's um at scripts as well is going to be looking at that um simult staining process but then using boncat tagged cells with that um lbb stain and then we're going to try to do TM edx of the minerals so a lot of people to thank um I'm just going to really quickly thank the RV Point sir crew and the research group there um it was a really great time and thank you for your time and I'll take any questions okay we've got about s six minutes for questions anybody have any questions maybe do you have a question okay I'll come over there thank you so much great talk um could you talk a little bit more about like how like the various ways in which you imagine it applying to like these these off World Systems like Mars like you mentioned um so for Mars that's going to take too long um so for Mars in the in gaale Crater there's you know there's nitrates that I've been seen um more on the manganese oxide cycle so this is um so rocks that have very high enrichments of Manganese oxides um and there's been a lot of look into it being a hallogen cycle that's kind of driving formation of Manganese oxides uh that was originally used as an argument for U Mars being oxygenated because on Earth manganese oxides are basically synonymous with an oxidized Earth um but sort of the idea now is that it was an anoxic system and there was very active hogen cycling driving that but that still thermodynamically doesn't quite match up as I understand um so I think finding a hyper saline um biologically driven oxidation of Manganese um kind of adds more to that sort of discourse of well someone can under hypers saing systems um sort of point the way to that does that answer it cool that was awesome thank you so much yeah hey Claire that's great work it's really awesome um I was wondering if I don't know if you can tell from the sem images but do they encrust or is it like uh like do the cells get encrusted with the manganese oxides or not at all that's what we're trying to figure out with tem because like I like the um the simultaneous staining it looks like the cells kind of have just like splotches of Manganese inside what looks like a biofilm this looks like a bofilm of cells kind of around a mineral which could also point to manganese oxidation is um also a very happy microbial process so these might just be manganese reducers here um and then yeah this one I'm not really sure I haven't seen um I know manganese oxides also work well as kind of like a protectant for cells so some will encrust manganese oxides around themselves but I never saw anything that was a cell with manganese it was always more manganes with cells engulfing around it okay and then secondly do you have any uh sort of hints as to any particular enzymes you might suspect is this like an open space or are they reusing something else maybe there is so Brad TBO has done so much work on this there's a multicopper oxidase that's sort of uh being pointed to as what could be driving this kind of metabolism um I know there's a there's a couple other oxidases that have been pointed to but um nothing that's like a very clear thought out pathway we'll wait for the transcriptomes exactly hi uh Ben Vegas here at Cornell um can you can you go back to your slide where you have the potential uh nitrate reaction that you think might be going on here oh dear God sorry I no you're fine all the way back to the beginning here the jokes aren't funny in Reverse okay so is the thought is that this is some kind of form of denitrification where you're releasing N2 yes okay um so then my question is is are you GNA ever going to be doing this again and can you measure the Isotopes of that n to that would be very cool right now I am uh setting up to measure so we have a GC ecd so I can measure nitrous oxide um and most denitrification is a little bit leaky so if I'm seeing nitrous oxide forming I can sort of extrapolate through kind of doing mass balance that okay there's some denitrification going on um but nothing nothing with Isotopes no I just my thought process is by monitoring the N2 species that can help you uh Trace back to this process rather than say nitrate being taken up by something else right in your body um and as as a deep time nitrogen person I just want to know what the isotope effect is yeah it would be cool to know yeah thank you give another round of applause for [Applause] Claire e okay the last talk session um will be by haia Mara via and she will be talk to talking to us about what could amino acids on Enceladus or Titan tell us about detecting life take it away cool thank you um can you all hear me okay that all right okay um I'm hypa media oh gra it quicker cool I'm G to talk to you about amino acids um I'm a first year Well a second year PhD student at ASU um so the work that I'm about to tell you about is like very much still in progress It's still cooking and so I am so excited to like get y'all's feedback and if there's something that I like missed or haven't thought of I really want to hear about it so I'm very excited so I think probably like most of us in this room uh the work that I do is very profoundly influenced by the Sci Fi that I watch uh growing up and especially about this project I think a lot about uh this one episode of The Original Series where the Enterprise runs into this life form that is silicon based and they don't realize that it's life at first and they don't realize that it's life until Spock is able to directly communicate with it and I think that this episode like is in conversation with like the D the the central question of astrobiology which is how do we find things that we don't know what they look like um I think it's it's our responsibility as astrobiologists to cast our net as wide as possible and so I like to think about other things that life could use like other kinds of life that could occur and so we'll talk about amino acids so my background is in like atmospheric chemistry and so when I think about that question of looking for life that we don't know I think about what chemistry could be biochemistry um and of course that has profound implications for a lot of aspects effects of astrobiology has you know bio signatures right what is a what is a fingerprint of Life what is the definition of Life anyway I think that if you asked five astrobiologists what life was You' get six answers um and it also gives us profound context for Earth whether you know there is sort of one way to get by as a as a biological system or if there are many possible ways to get by cool so um for Earth life there are about 20 amino acids that are Co that means they're included in our genetic code um they they hold information for us they allow us to reproduce um but there are lots of amino acids that are not coded and we don't really know why they're not coded we don't really know why we ended up with the 20 that we did we don't know why we ended up with 20 um and so I like to think about what other amino acids could be involved in life and how do we measure that and how do we compare sets of amino acids to each other to figure out which ones are could be biological and which ones cannot be biological so my uh background like I said is in atmospheric chemistry and so I've been thinking about Titan and Enceladus for a few years so that's where I decided to start we also have a lot of really cool uh studies that have been done about amino acids at these sites um so Titan for example um we have pretty consistently been able to reproduce the the production of like simple amino acids from uh atmospheric simulations um in Chambers but we haven't like directly detected it on the moon so there's like a lot of thought about about that um that's really cool but you know so so we have like these sets of amino acids that we think could occur but we haven't seen them really similar for Enceladus um yeah like like we we have the ingredients there we think that it might be able to happen but we haven't directly detected it there was this really cool study in 2017 by Guzman and colleagues um who proposed that maybe cometary material could have deposited amino acids onto the moon and introduce them to the system so they had like this list of amino acids they thought could be there and concentrations for it and recommendations for future missions which is really exciting um so even even if we sent a mission out there if if you know we sent a worm to Enceladus or we send dragonfly to Titan and we see amino acids what is that going to mean like like what does that tell us about astrobiology what does that tell us about the astrobiological potential of these sites how do we contextualize that information so I think one way that we can do that uh is with assembly Theory and assembly theory is a way of thinking about how we construct an object from its con ENT parts so here's a couple of amino acid examples we have Glycine and Arginine um so this is all of the steps that you would have to go through to build Arginine they're not chemistry steps they're like like Legos like you have a bucket of Legos and you're sticking them together and then at the end you build arany so this whole number of steps is called the assembly pathway and the number of steps you have to take for the on the shortest pathway the most efficient pathway is called the assembly index and that's one way that we can like measure how complicated at something is um so for example we can just like trivially do this with the the 20 amino acids that we have here uh coded so we have molecular weight on the x axis and we have path length which here is like assembly index basically uh on the y axis and so we can see that we have this nice consistent Trend as like things get bigger it takes more steps to build them you would expect that um and so we can also see that it does not take very many steps to build these things because they're really simple it's like glycine is like two steps and like tryptophan the most complicated one is like 14 so it's it's they're they're small and they're easy to build so um but what I'm interested in is not just like the pathway as a whole or the number of steps that it takes like some other Studies have been interested in what I'm interested in is the fragments themselves the pieces the Legos that we're adding together to get to this final product I'm interested in them because it's something that we can directly measure with a mass spec so you know lot of Precedence for putting Mass specs onto missions um and by breaking something apart by fragmenting it we can count the number of fragments and we can we can directly measure this so it has like direct Mission relevance so how do we apply this to amino acids so here's the here's the pipeline that I've been developing and and working on and we'll talk through it uh it's it's big and complicated but we'll go step by step so uh first I start with some amino acids that are involved in a reaction or that have been proposed for some kind of kind of system so that might be the amino acids that Guzman suggested that might be the amino acids that we've been able to form in Titan atmospheric simulation chambers that kind of thing and then I break them into pieces as much as I possibly can and then I build possible molecules from those fragments so I have my bucket of Legos and I stick them together randomly and I get other things that you could have gotten from those same fragments in a system that has those fragments what other things could have been built other than the these amino acids um but that these fragments you know you might have noticed on the pathway like these are not things that would be stable like if you put them out in the world they would fly apart some of them they're not like thermodynamically stable so when I do this part what I get out not all of these pieces are thermodynamically stable not all of them could occur in a real system so I want to ask chemistry what chemistry thinks as well so first I go through my Legos and I sort out the ones that are not thermodynamically stable uh I calculate their affinity and then I calculate the abundances for each fragment based on the reaction conditions that we did uh and then I speciate the fragment so I stick them together according to chemistry rules and I get out a different set of things that could possibly be built from these fragments and of course for that I need like my experimental conditions like pressure temperature and pH here's where we get the geochemical system that's affecting what could happen there so now I have a couple of different lists for like other things that could have been built from these items but we're not so so I'm able to map them uh across the space of like what parts do they share what parts do they not share um I'm able to rank them by like the assembly index that I was talking how complicated are they and also like their thermodynamic Affinity in different environments How likely are they to occur according to thermodynamics and it answers like some Central questions that get at what I'm curious about what other objects could be built from the fragments but weren't and why didn't we see them and what's the relationship between this this abstract assembly space so things that may or may not occur and chemistry where we have these thermodynamic rules that's controlling what can happen so coming back to our big question this can give us some context for Earth so you know I showed you those assembly Pathways that are like all these little steps that can get there if we have that's for one object if we have a set of objects we can think about the joint assembly space so it's all the steps that you would have to go through to build that set of things some of those steps will be shared right you know some of these amino acids have pieces in common um and so can you know if if two objects have a lot of things in common their joint dis simply space will be more efficient than if they're very different so here's two like sort of abstract spaces to explain what I mean so we have path a where we're making objects and path B where we're making objects so let's say you know we go to the system and we observe some things uh we can compare like these two different Pathways by their end objects the copy number like how much did we actually see there what's the abundance we can compare them by the assembly index like how complicated are they uh and we but what I'm really interested in is comparing them by their reuse of Parts how related are these systems within themselves how related are the amino acids right is it true that life consistently prefers a set of amino acids that are really similar to each other so you can like build them quite efficiently together without a lot of like energy expenditure or is it true that life prefers amino acids that are like pretty different from each other that might be able to fill like many different functions um we don't know and so I I'm really curious about that as I work through my pipeline so here's an example of what I mean uh we've got our nucleo bases here so you can see like there's some pieces in common that uh you know they they it suggests that they are like pretty similar to each other and can be built together pretty efficiently so that might be one way that we can tell an abiotic system from a biotic system by how many parts are shared how efficiently they can be built together so my next steps I am currently working through the pipeline uh developing all the little code pieces uh using some glycin glycine reactions that we did just in the lab um and but once it's all complete I want to run through the coded set of 20 amino acids so that I can compare that to the proposed or observed in analog sets for Titan and Enceladus those Guzman sets and horse sets that I was talking about earlier um I'm curious about the use of fragments within the sets uh what thresholds can be set for the assembly index and the copy number of detections and also whether amino acids could be built from hu systems but weren't why didn't we see them um yeah cool so I want to end on this because um this gets at the heart of like the study and why I think it's important so like I said I think it's the responsibility of astrobiologist to cast our net as wide as possible because the risk of missing life because we didn't know it was life because it's so far from us is simply too high um the symbol that's overlaid on this is from Vulcan philosophy which is like weirdly welldeveloped um um and it stands for infinite diversity and infinite combinations which is the central dogma of biology in my opinion that that you know we live in a world of combinations and recombinations and the pantheon of molecules and ideas of people should be celebrated and protected and kept safe um I want to say thanks to all the people that I work with they are so wonderful um I came from a very like different background and so they've really helped me get oriented in this new space and also I want to say that my work would not be possible without the union that I'm in um I would not be able to do the work that I do without the raises that they fought for and uh you should join your local union all right we've got about five minutes for questions question are you considering using um machine learning algorithms or neural neural network potentials um for predicting different uh connectivities of the amino acids that would be really cool that's not something that I've done yet but I think it would be really interesting especially because we have like these massive data sets that we're working with like you know ji or or keg or something like really tremendous stuff um that would be interesting to train like an AI on but I myself have not done that yet but that would be so cool hi Ashley harwig from Florida International University um what are you using or what do you plan to use to calculate the thermodynamic stabilities of your reactions and your fragments because I think it's a good idea and I really like the path that you're taking because it's kind of like going in reverse but like breaking a part like you said with Legos so I'm just curious like how you're going to calculate those stabilities yeah absolutely this is what I was working on un L you um so uh it's been a it's been a steep learning curve for me but I use um ASC and orca which are two tools that you can use to um optimize the geometries of molecules so they do a lot of uh Quantum thermodynamic calculations with like dftt and stuff like that um to wiggle the parts of the molecule to get it to an optimal geometry and you know recalculating it at each step to try to figure out where thermodynamically stable is for that molecule so I use ASC and orca um uh but then once I have those stable fragments um I use a tool that was developed by a a professor at ASU Everett shock called worm and it uh is I see some of y'all are familiar it's really great uh it's able to do calculations about things that are on like Earth Systems like submerged in water that kind of thing um to like I was talking about speciation stick them together and figure out what reactions would happen hi uh I'm Rory from CU Boulder and I really like this talk thanks um my question is if you have idea that with this assembly and Thermo approach if you could address this question of chirality and preference for chirality and biology that's so cool um I don't know I don't think so um well I don't know I I think that probably the difference in chirality might make a difference in the thermodynamics and like the way that they combine but I'm not sure that's not something I've thought about but that would be so cool because you know that's such a huge open question similar to like we don't know why these 20 we don't know why they're all sort of left handed you know yeah that's so cool any more questions any online you have another one hi I'm sha from George Washington University and your study was so good and you're planning to like work on amino acids so I'm just curious to know about like these amino acids have different different Natures like uh non polar polar and they have different side chains like so how we want to deal that with that uh problems on like you're working for amino acids for Titan so I want to know that sorry what no I I want to know that how you going to work with those amino acid like you said the next steps will be coded for 20 amino acids and they have different Natures like they cannot be dissolved in water and they can they can be dissolved in water they are acidic they are just basic so how you going to deal with that problem I want to know that yeah that's a really good question um so there are like some changes I can make within the the speciation software worm um to try to get a little bit closer to Titan system but it was really designed for Earth and so there's limitations to what I can do there um uh the as far as the amino acids themselves um once I like have broken them apart the idea is that like like a bucket of Legos you know you can build like many different things out of them without it necessarily being um geochemically specific and rather you know once we have this final product we test whether or not it could actually exist in that environment so like the the building process itself um on the the pipeline it it starts to get complicated like right about here once we get to once we get to specific systems but up until that point it should be um uh agnostic okay thank you and and this is not a question but I want to just give you an idea that there are 20 essential amino acids so there are only 20 amino acids there in the that have been discovered so far so if you can you just discover some others also perfect try all right let's give another round of applause all right so we're on break from 2:30 to 3:00 p.m. and then at 3 p.m. we have our um next keynote so be sure to make that because it'll be great um just reminder to just remember to say your name in your University when you're asking questions and then um if you're giving a talk tomorrow just make sure that some of the slides uh look good before you present uh Jennifer it was not your fault it's sometimes this computer is very mean to people so um just check to make sure your slides look good all right for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

[Music] e e e e hello welcome back from break everyone I hope youall had some coffee wake up a little bit for our second keynote um today we have Dr Jonathan lunine presenting for us on how I became a scientist in exploration of the so solar systems ocean world so Dr lunine is the David C Duncan professor in physical sciences and chair of the Department of astronomy here at Cornell although he just announced that he is now going to be Chief scientist at JPL starting end of the summer beginning of the Fall um he is interested in how planets form and evolve what processes maintain and establish habitability and what kinds of exotic environments might host a kind of chemistry sophisticated enough to be called life so I'll hand it over to you all right well thank you and it's really a pleasure to be here uh I was asked to give an autobiographical talk as well as discuss some science I always get a little worried about the autobiographical part because my life is not all that exciting uh there's a big difference between someone who studies rocks and stars and someone who is a rock star and sometimes you get they get confused but we'll give it a try here we go all right I was born in 1959 in New York City I I think that's my real hair but both my parents are dead so I don't know um and my mother was a rocket at Radio City Music Hall one of the famous Precision tap dancers my father ran a habd daser store I was interested in astronomy from very very early on I Remember The Golden Book of astronomy but most of what stimulated my interest was being so fortunate to be able to live in Manhattan seven blocks from the Hayden planetarium which is one of the great planetaria in the world and this is what it looked like when I was growing up it got completely renovated into something called The Rose center today but at that time it was brick building with a green Dome and as a little kid if I could get my mother or my older cousin to take me there it would just be going into the wonders of the universe and in particular in the Sky Theater there was you sit in these seats this Zeiss projector which could project uh the uh brightness and positions of thousands of stars would Rise Up from the center of the circular Star theater kind of like some alien creature and open up the heavens and in living in Manhattan you really can't see the stars very well and so this was the only way that I could do that and then controlling all of this before the age of the computer was an astronomer and the astronomer who at that time was always a male uh would you know stand at this console and operate dials and levers and tour us around the stars and I thought wow you know this is someone with a lot of power uh commanding this thing to Rise Up from the center of the Sky Theater and opening up the Heavens so this really made a big difference and I was very very interested in astronomy for that reason I was also interested in space and science fiction and so here I am probably around the age of I don't know 12 maybe and in my bedroom you can see the lunar module in the background from Apollo and those pictures to my right are uh art from the covers of analog science fiction magazin so I was very interested as well in both space flight and science fiction so Apollo 11 landed on the moon when I was 10 years old and the later apoll misss 15 16 and 17 were uh multi day geological Expeditions it was possible to order from the US government printing office these guide books on the moon with Apollo 15 or 16 or 17 they would detail all of the geologic stations and the time there and the various geologic features and the observations and activities now I discovered this after Apollo 15 so I ordered the ones for 16 and 17 and fortunately we had cable TV in New York City very early form of T of cable TV and there wasn't very much in the way of programming available for cable TV so the moon walks for 156 and 17 which pretty much have been abandoned by the networks were just broadcast without interruption on cable TV and so I remember sitting up at 2:00 or 3: in the morning as it happened to be for I think Apollo 16 and following along with the geologic guide book and feeling like I was really part of those Expeditions so that too made a really big impression on me the idea that you could even vicariously participate in some of the most astounding Adventures that human beings could have which is to not only walk on the moon but drive around and do geology and science there I was also into science fiction um first year of Star Trek I was too young uh it was after my bedtime but I managed to sneak a glance once and I was really fascinated so I was able to watch it in subsequent seasons and I became a total triky went to Star Trek conventions I also there were some science fiction authors I really loved Isaac azimoff and Arthur C Clark in particular 2001 the Space Odyssey the movie was a complete mystery to me but um I read the book and and I thought it was great and I went on to read childhood's end and the city and the Stars those are the original books that I had um I also had a tendency to get a little bit into uh fantasy and um things that perhaps a more skeptical person wouldn't have believed in I really was captivated by the idea that extraterrestrials had visited the Earth and had made their mark on human civilization and I was taken in by Eric Von donin's book Chariots of the Gods U this is a contemporary picture with my one of our two dogs EMT EMT is clearly very disappointed that I would own that book and uh has uh positioned himself where that book belongs uh it was really a nothing Burger but you know as a kid I just I I was taken in by this luckily around that same time a book came out that was both skeptical and Visionary and that book was the cosmic connection an extraterrestrial perspective written by a Cornell professor named Carl Sean this was years before the Cosmos series and I can't remember how I got wind to this book I think it was in sky and Telescope magazine but I ordered it it came in the mail several weeks later there was no Amazon of course uh and I I read it and I was thrilled because the book was at once skeptical and at the same time Visionary about the possibility of humankind's Destiny being in the cosmos it was a beautifully written book and I was so taken by it that I would read it out loud in our apartment uh my mother finally said why don't you write to Professor Sean and I thought well that's ridiculous I was first year in high school you know he's not going to write back to a high school kid but my mother was very insistent and so we always listened to our moms and I wrote and he wrote back and he wrote this letter April 1974 about how to become an astronomer in great detail and he also enclosed a couple of reprints from the Mariner 9 Mission which was going on at the time so I was really thrilled by this I wrote back we had exchanges of letters he remembered that years later this was really seminal for me because it connected me to a real astronomer and a real astronomer who is willing to tell me here's what you should study to become an astronomer study Physics and math and you don't have to go to in fact it was sort of ironic he was explaining why Cornell didn't have an undergraduate major in astronomy and today we have an undergraduate major in astronomy but he said at the time you really just need physics and so on so this was really thrilling for me and it pointed the way to my being able to be an astronomer and then I lost um courage right around that same time some months later I wasn't sure I wanted to be an astronomer after all the reason for that is that at that time the NASA budget in fact the whole research budget of the United States was declining and the NASA budget in particular was coming down from uh a high during the peak of the Apollo development to a value in 1974 that was uh a factor of three time smaller so if you didn't know what the future held which of course couldn't at the time and you looked at this chart it looked like NASA was going out of business and The Stereotype at the time was that physics or astronomy phds were finding careers driving taxi caps which is an honorable profession I mean it's very important here's a vintage 1970s view of taxi cabs in Manhattan but I didn't think I could really make it as a taxi driver so I decided I would instead become a medical doctor and like Jonas sulk I would in you know invent some great vaccine or some sort of uh you know cure for whatever so I uh I volunteered at Mount Si hospital as a high school student working for a cancer doctor that turned out to be mostly writing reprint request cards so in those days because you couldn't just go on the internet and get the paper you wanted doctors in particular would write out all of these requests on little postcards send them off and weeks later there would be a reprint um so I wanted to be a doctor my pediatrician who also turned out to have been a Cornell Alum I guess didn't think that that was necessarily the right career for me because he wrote a letter to me in August of 74 pointing out that there was a talk downtown sponsored by the Cornell Alumni Association all about Aro Observatory and the talk was given by Frank Drake very famous astronomer who really was the in Inventor instigator of seti and he was giving a talk on the new astronomy that was being done with arbo now that the reflector had been resurfaced with uh a uh not chicken wire which which is what it had originally or mesh but a real reflective surface so I I almost said I'm not interested I'm going to be a doctor I went to the talk I was fascinated I remember leaving the talk thinking I don't want to be a medical doctor I really do want to be an astronomer so here's another Cornell professor who kind of put me back in the right direction and may have saved many lives uh who could have suffered from my Clumsy medical skills and years later 40 years later in fact um because I was too uh intimidated as a high school student to talk to Professor Drake at the time of the talk 40 years later I had a chance to be with Frank Drake at the 50th anniversary of arbo and I told him the story he thought it was very funny he could be convince anyone to change their careers but he was very gracious about it sadly of sadly of course this no longer exists and the reflectors pretty much destroyed but at the time it was doing great great science um all right so so my father passed away uh right around the same time he was an alcoholic and also a pill abuser it was very dark times in my family and uh actually Star Trek and Carl San and the the Drake talk were things that really kind of kept me going but by the time I decided to go back to astronomy things were getting better my mother remarried uh this this is my stepfather Norman Jacobs who uh is retired now an Australian chemist and uh so that was going well and uh I applied to Cornell got into Cornell we couldn't afford it uh because our finances were just in bad shape our family finances but I got a great scholarship from the University of Rochester and had a terrific undergraduate education there Melora if anybody is you of are no okay where's Aiden so he's from the U ofr so I majored in physics and astronomy had a great education there uh had a wonderful uh Professor uh for Stellar atmospheres hu Van Horn who actually got his PhD here at Cornell in the late 1960s and he team taught it with Judy Piper who got her PhD here at Cornell as well and Hugh Van Horn became my senior thesis adviser so around the time I took that course uh spring of 1979 I still subscribed to Sky and Telescope the March 1979 issue of sky and Telescope had this beautiful image of Jupiter taken by Voyager One on its way inbound to uh the encounter with Jupiter now that image is not so impressive today Juno and all that do much better but at the time it was astounding it was much better than what groundbased telescopes could do and so when I saw this cover image I realized that the kind of astronomy I wanted to do was planetary science and I wanted in particular to participate in spacecraft missions like Voyager so Hugh was very very nice about all this uh he was not a planetary scientist but he said he would propose a senior thesis project as close to the planets as possible which turned out to be doing models of the Sun it's pretty close you know the planets go around the Sun but Hugh also introduced me to the person that would be my dissertation advisor I ended up applying to a number of schools um my stepfather encouraged me to go west so I ended up at Caltech and David Stevenson who also got his PhD here at Cornell about 10 years after hu Van Horn had just started at celtech as a new assistant professor and you made the Conta act and we started working together and he became my my PhD adviser so it was a very intense uh four years that's pretty short time um it was not all smooth there were some rocky periods uh Dave and I had nearly had a breakup because I kind of lost focus on what I wanted to do and you know began spending time doing other things both in science and outside of science he wrote me this uh letter handwritten letter two pages and um we had a long discussion and that kind of got me back on track so I think Dave's Dave is retired now I think his style of mentoring at that time might not be the style that's necessarily the gold standard today but it really did work for me and getting over that crisis and having him uh point out when I was losing focus was really important this was the most fun project posing an ocean of ethane on Titan's surface which was a motivation for uh some of the uh instrument designs for what would become the Cassini and huan's Mission so I got my PhD I went to the lunar and planetary lab in Tucson as a postto uh this is a picture of me around that time and I'm showing you that picture so that you can compare my face in the picture to my face now and to just point out to you that in your 20s and 30s you have much more energy uh much more of the things that come with youth and that that's a very important uh aspect to take advantage of I mean here I am smiling with these very sort of uh well I'm not going to attempt to describe it but anyway um yeah it goes downhill from there so that's the main point uh but I was a a postto uh this is my mother's third husband she remarried although she remained uh friends with my stepfather uh for uh up until her death so I was postto at lunar and planetary lab I did a little uh one term or one quarter uh stint as a visiting assistant professor at UCLA and I applied for faculty positions and there were a number I didn't get I didn't get the one at the University of Hawaii or round or this or that but there were two offers and one was from the University of Arizona and I came back to Tucson so this is my offer letter and if you can read it I want to point out a couple of things first of all this salary actually $29,000 is really good because in today's dollars it's over $80,000 which is pretty good for an assistant professor but I want you to notice the startup package the startup package which today is often hundreds of thousands of dollars or a million dollars sometimes uh guaranteed my first year summer salary for three months that's pretty standard and then it gave me operating funds in the amount of $1,000 wow okay that does not equate to a million dollars today to cover telephone copying all the things that we worry about today right and travel in the additional amount of $2,000 so and oh a personal computer an IBM PCAT does anyone know what a PCAT looks like it's this box with a fan and a TV screen on top and it goes and it was pretty cool all right so I actually started with a very small startup package now I'm not saying that if you apply for faculty positions and you get a faculty position you should say just give me $1,000 um but it turned out in my case that because I was so interested in in missions that it really didn't matter uh that a lot of the resources that came from NASA were the things that were able to to keep me going okay I got married in 1987 uh my wife uh Cynthia Ying now Cynthia lunine is there my sister is on my left and she's a dancer and our stepfather is there on the right uh we have one son Cynthia and I who's uh now living in Philadelphia and is a software engineer and uh I just got started proposing for Missions and uh this is the best list I could come up with for this talk it's probably not entirely complete but my point in showing this is first of all that you will never get all the missions you propose for the red ones are the ones that either my proposal was rejected or the team that I was on was rejected or the proposal was accepted but then either the instrument or the mission was cancelled that was the case for the comet rendevu penetrator the circle camera for the Rosetta choon Lander the whole Lander was cancelled and uh Europa Orbiter ice pack so this was 2000 so it has been 26 years 24 years sorry since um people were proposing instruments for Europa missions that's a very very long time right and we're within months of a mission actually launching so the big ones uh that were important to me voyager Neptune I was a guest investigator on the ultraviolet spectrometer for the Neptune encounter Cassini hyans has been a big part of my life from the late 80s up through the end of the mission in 2017 James web Space Telescope sorry about that James web Space Telescope right there as an interdisciplinary scientist 20 years of development 20 years of meetings of the science working group and of course that telescope went from a billion to 11 Bill uh 10 billion doll almost 11 uh Juno has been a great Mission orbiting around Jupiter and then Europa Clipper and juice so those are kind of the big missions and in all of this I don't I don't build instruments uh I don't really do data analysis uh in my first year in enm enm lab uh at Rochester I broke a voltmeter and also shocked my uh lab partner he was okay um so I really uh I've been a theorist and I've been able to work on these missions in roles like interdisciplinary scientist or COI responsible for uh planning and development of uh the science Concepts that would then lead to the building of those instruments and then participating in the data analysis uh and the theory that goes on behind it so that's really how my career has gone and it's worked out pretty well um in 2007 after thinking about this for a very long time I grew up in a Jewish Family I was baptized and confirmed in the Catholic church at the Newman Center at the University of Arizona where I was a professor uh not saying that you should do that as part of your career this was something that I had been thinking about for a very long time and realized that my own personal and spiritual beliefs aligned uh with Christianity and since that time I've pursued um work on science and Faith the question of the conflict between science and faith is it real is it not the harmony between science and Faith I've helped to start a few organ organizations I've given a lot of talks and this has been very enriching for me uh and uh for some of the students and others I've worked with but it's also I think for me personally when I did convert I was very worried that many of my friends who are Jewish would reject me and that turned out absolutely not to be the case and so it was a really wonderful thing to realize that friends who really are friends um will be a friend regardless of of you know how you change and that was a wonderful thing to realize so academically this has been my journey I start out at Rochester went to Caltech got my PhD there went to the University of Arizona taught there for uh 25 years thought we would stay forever we love Tucson but um I got tired of the some of the politics associated with the state and also the politics of being at a State University and watching ASU for those of you who are Sun Devils uh kind of grow um and overshadow the U OFA um during two sabatical and many s Summers my wife and I came to love uh Italy uh made many friends there our son didn't like it quite so much but around 2008 I applied for a three year teaching position and was able to negotiate leave of absence from the U OFA to go teach at the University of Rome T verata um this turned out in the end to be a real disaster uh because of burles scone was the prime minister at the time the education Minister was in there really to get rid of higher education as far as I could tell there were strikes by the younger researchers it was just it was really a mess but in the middle of this around 2010 Jim Bell who had been here at Cornell moved to Arizona State University I have nothing against sundevils by the way I think it's it's great place so he moved to ASU and that left an empty position at Cornell and a colleague of mine called me up and asked if I would be interested potentially in coming to Cornell so I said goodbye to uh Rome and said goodbye to the University of Arizona everyone was very gracious there and moved to Cornell in 2011 with my family been here for 13 years had a wonderful wonderful time um have been the director of the Cornell Center for astrophysics and planetary science department chair uh and then an opportunity has come up in a place where I have done most of my scientific research over 40 years and that's jet propulsion laboratory to help uh guide their science and develop strategic plans at a time when science is not doing all that well in Nas NASA uh compared to other things so I agreed to do that and so it's back up to Pasadena California I don't have any intention of going around this game board again uh once around is enough and uh then I will retire so I wanted to talk briefly about mentors mentors are really important and these are some of the ones that I've had over time so Carl Sean inspired me and showed me that I could be a scientist Hugh Van Horn uh was the best Professor I had at Rochester and and introduced me to my thesis advisor David Stevenson who I thought was um really a great thesis adviser despite some of our ups and downs Don Hunton who's passed away now was my postto advisor at Arizona and both Dave and Don plug me into studies for the Cassini mission that were going on during the 1980s that enabled me to then write proposals that allowed me to get onto the the uh first the hyans part and then the Cassini part of the mission Charles elachi at JPL uh got me involved in uh discussions about what you could do with a radar system on Saturn's moon Titan and that eventually led to my being on the radar team for Cassini but it was angeleta cordini who was uh my best friend in Italy who had a lot of influences on me I met her when I was still a graduate student she also plugged me into studies for Cassini and invited me to um to U uh conferences that were relevant to this and uh then she arranged for our sabatical and uh even until she got into a big fight with the people above her was going to uh groom me to be uh the next director of The Institute that she was running angeletta was the director of two Institutes of space astrophysics in Italy which at the time was very unusual Italy is behind the United States in terms of diversity and opportunity she was one of only two women who directed A Research Institute in the '90s and oos uh passed away from cancer in 2011 but the thing that I remember most about angeletta is she was the one who was willing to tell me what my flaws were which uh as a mentor is really essential but can be done in a really bad way or a really good way and she managed to do it in a really good way she she showed me told me what my kryptonite was and unfortunately I learned about this too late to kind of correct some of the things that had happened earlier in my career that were part of this personality defect but once she told me about it it was something that worked on for a long time after that so she's the one I'm really most grateful to and unfortunately is no longer with us so what can we learn from this part of the talk uh mentors are super important and being a mentor is a great responsibility and most of us are not as good at it as we could be because we're not well trained so training of mentors is super important and now the National Science Foundation requires proposals pi on proposals to write out a mentoring plan for their students and to give progress reports on that every year of the proposal and is something that NASA should do as well graduate school I don't need to tell you this it's pivotal habits are formed when you are a graduate student focus is important I lost Focus halfway through grad school luckily my adviser pulled me back a passion for what you're doing is super important because we're not in the highest paid jobs in the world to be honest compared to finance so please do make the most of it and here's that point you really are at your intellectual and physical best in your 20s and 30s so that's a good time to take those risks that will allow you to really find your strengths and your weaknesses and uh to uh recognize that while we kind of grow in wisdom after that wisdom doesn't really Trump um some of the advantages of Youth and they're twists and turns in life to the extent that you can take advantage of them I love this quote by geralo cardano who was a 16th century doctor and kind of a Renaissance person and he wrote at the end of his autobiography year before he died that one should live cheerfully and good in the exercise of some art in which one is skilled and what we're doing in science is the art which we are all skilled in here so I want to move on on in the last 20 minutes the talk to the search for life in the outer solar system and I want to focus on three objects that have the best evidence for liquids either on their surfaces or in their Interiors Jupiter's moon Europa Saturn's moon Enceladus Saturn's moon Titan all three have oceans under their surfaces uh in the case of Europa and Enceladus there are multiple lines of evidence for those oceans in the case of Titan is a little shakier and that ocean is very deep down but Titan has another kind of liquid liquid methane and ethane covering 1% of its surface and that makes it a very very intriguing place so let's start with Europa and you know I recognize that some of you who are working on these objects know this stuff so um please chime in in the question period or now if you want uh so Jupiter's moon Europa is the size of our own moon it's a mostly Rocky world has a density of 3 gram per cubic centimeter uh has a very tenuous atmosphere it's embedded in a very intense radiation field of Jupiter that makes it extremely hard to explore Europa even with robotic spacecraft and it has a subsurface water ocean under an ice crust that has very few crators on it so that it's evidently a very young and active surface and this image from Galileo shows a region where the ice has been broken apart and rotated over what must have been at the time of that rotation a liquid of water liquid ice floating on water so the Galo probe actually discovered that that water is in existence today I'll explain briefly in a moment how that's known given the density of Europa and given then and the amount of ice that can be present given that the liquid is somewhere can't be too far below the surface one can do a model of Europa that demonstrates that the amount of water liquid water in Europa is somewhere between the amount that's on the earth that's this little drop here up to about twice that so europa's ocean is between one and two times the volume of the Earth's ocean which is extraordinary because it makes for a lot of space for whales for sure but the question is are there whales are there any organic molecules of any kind at all and that's been the difficulty in understanding that ocean so this is kind of a model the other important thing about Europa as opposed to ganimat and Kalisto which also have oceans is that because Europa is mostly Rocky and actually doesn't have that much water ice and liquid water the base of the ocean is at a pressure that's below the pressure at which High Press ices of water become stable and so the contact between the Rock and the liquid water ocean is not interrupted by high pressure ises the way it would be on ganim or on Kalisto or even on Titan and that means that minerals that are leeched from the rock are accessible to any organisms that might be present in that ocean so that makes Europa very special among the gallan moons so the way that this ocean was really discovered came from the Galileo magnetometer Jupiter's magnetic field axis is tilted relative to its rotation axis so if you look at the if you're in the plane of europa's orbit which is this green line here what you see is the magnetic field lines bobbing up and down relative to the plane of the orbit if you look at that image long enough you see those field lines bobbing up and down so from the point of view of a conductor in europa's orbit two things are happening one is the field is moving at the rotation speed of Jupiter so it's sweeping through the body whether it's a conductor or a insulator and number two there is a Time varying magnetic field because of this bobbing which if this body is a conductor in orbit around Europa generates Eddie currents which then generate an induced magnetic field and it was the induced magnetic field that the Galileo Orbiter in 1997 and 8 detected during several flybys of Europa and the geometry of that field and its strength required that it not be deep down an iron core which Europa probably doesn't have anyway but rather had to be near the the surface and something like the conductivity of slightly salty water so that was really the slam dunk for an ocean underneath the surface of of Europa and it was remarkable because it was one of the few things that the Galileo Orbiter which had a damaged antenna and a broken tape recorder could really do it couldn't make very many images because of problems associated with its uh launch and deployment all right so the question then is um are there signatures the ocean on the surface of Europa and that is the big question there are a lot of brown stains on this icy surface a lot of that is probably stuff from EUR from IO nearby IO uh that has been deposited sulfur deposits magnesium salts and so on that are then radiation darkened but there's also indications of other things this image was not taken by Galileo this was taken by the Juno spacecraft in a flyby of Europa a couple of years ago the camera the Stellar reference unit is actually an engineering camera designed to take pictures at low light levels of stars in the background of Jupiter so that Engineers can determine the orientation of the spacecraft but it's also a great geology camera and this image was taken uh when the sun was on the other side of Europa the Imaging the light was Jupiter shines this is taken in Jupiter shine and what you see here is an area of Europa that is crisscrossed by lots of different fractures and has this very curious feature here which informally um we call the uh platypus and if you stare at it long enough you can see that it really is a platypus with the eyes and the beak and the body there um so Heidi Becker at JPL is the principal investigator of the science component of the the Juno SRU and led uh a paper which we published uh earlier this year this was a lot of fun because this feature was also imaged at poor resolution by Galileo in the 1990s at a different angle it was possible to put together a stereo image it's possible to put together topography and it turns out that this part of the Platypus is slightly doed and that allowed us to distinguish between ious models and the model that fits the formation of this feature best is one that was published by Britney Schmidt about 13 years ago in which you have um a warm uh region that comes up to the surface melts a mixture of ice and salt a brine essentially uh that causes the feature to collapse and then as it refreezes the expansion uh causes the center of it to dome up and that fits this thing very very well so this is evidence and there are other features like this uh of liquid water and salt melting in the crust the other thing you see here up in this region is a fracture with these dark stains on it and that's very similar to a feature that Galileo imaged Elsewhere on Europa and was analyzed by Len quick at Goddard space flight center and Matt Hedman as being the deposits from Little plumes that uh are along this axis and depositing this material which is then radiation darken so what is the material that's actually contributing to that radiation darkening well it turns out that Europa has um been uh a great Target for Hubble Space Telescope and James web Space Telescope in 2019 Samantha Trumbo and colleagues Samantha was a graduate student in Caltech at that time she's been a 51 Peg B postdoctoral fellow here at Cornell and is now on her way to San Diego in a faculty position uh they mapped salt sodium chloride spectroscopically on Europa surface and saw that it correlated geographically with those chaos features that chaos terrain with all of those crisscrossing lines and and features like the Platypus so sodium chloride could would be from IO but how why would it be geographically located like this it looks like something from the interior what pointed to this really coming from the interior was that when the web telescope was launched it was able to look in the infrared and m carbon dioxide on europa's Surface and carbon dioxide also is correlated with those same chaos features the thinnest part of the crust the most heavily fractured the most most likely places where the ocean is going to be coming out onto the surface so in two papers trombone Brown and another by led by hanano viena uh the CO2 data were published it really looks like the ocean is in contact with the surface and produces carbon dioxide and salt from its interior so does it have Organics and where in detail are those places located well that's the role of Europa Clipper the mission that will be launched in October uh Clipper will orbit Jupiter and make 50 flybys of uh Europa and that way the radiation dose is minimized relative to if you were to orbit Europa itself and Europa Clipper is extremely well instrumented it has two Mass spectrometers it has ultraviolet visible and near infrared uh cameras and spectrometers it has a thermal infrared uh bom for detecting hotpots there's a radar that Professor Schmidt's involved in that will hopefully penetrate to the ocean and then it has a much better magnetometer and plasma measuring device than Galileo which will get the salinity the conductivity and therefore the salinity of the ocean uh much more precisely than Galileo could and then gravity will get the overall structure so um it'll be launched hopefully in October fingers crossed uh a mission called juice Jupiter icy Moon Explorer is already on its way built by the European Space Agency its main focus is ganim me and Kalisto but it will do a couple of flybys of Europa and hopefully contribute to those investigations so let me move on to Enceladus Enceladus is a surprising object because it's so small it's a moon of Saturn 500 kilometers across it turns out to be as you learned in the Keynote dressed by Morgan cable on what are we Tuesday night Monday night Monday night okay I got second guess good uh so you learned all about it there I'm not going to review that it has this marvelous plume which material is pouring out the Cassini spacecraft the Cassini Saturn Orbiter carried two mass spectrometers and was able to fly through that plume which it discovered and make measurements of the composition of the ice and the gas and by doing that it demonstrated that this material was really from the ocean and then by making other kinds of measurements of the libration of Enceladus in particular demonstrated that there really is a global ocean of liquid water so one of the things I want to focus on is the potential for life and in a paper by Hunter weiten colleagues in 2017 Chris glin at swery in the supplement portion did a remarkable calculation in which he took the data from the mass spectrometers which showed the abundance of carbon dioxide methane water and hydrogen as Morgan talked about and he assumed that these were related to each other through a process that's called methanogenesis that carbon dioxide and hydrogen were making methane furthermore it was possible to constrain the pH the acidity of the ocean because chlorine and other components of salts were also measured by Cassini so it was possible for Chris to put together a plot of the What's called the Affinity chemical Affinity which is the departure from equilibrium assuming that this reaction occurs or set of reactions that are summarized here versus the amount of hydrogen that's present in the ocean and uh there these lines are lines of constant pH uh assuming this reaction ction is relevant so if you plot where the Cassini data lie they're in the blue here constrained by the ph and constrained by the hydrogen mixing ratio and that's a significant departure from equilibrium the Affinity is zero if the ocean is in equilibrium if the CO2 and methane and hydrogen abundances are what you would expect in thermodynamic equilibrium but they're not so you say aha potential for Life yes but most life on the Earth keeps its environment close to thermodynamic equilibrium basically if you walk into a pizza shop and there are lots of uneaten pizzas there you assume that there are no human beings there to eat the pizza and you go ahead and you consume it bringing the pizza shop close to equilibrium in this case this is a little suspicious but in fact as Tory holler pointed out in 2022 there are terrestrial ecosystems microbes which can't keep their environment close to equilibrium because they're limited by the nutrients they're limited by the amount of hydrogen or something else and so this blue box actually sits pretty comfortably in the range that terrestrial ecosystems that have methanogenesis in them actually lie and so it's possible that indeed there is life in the ocean of Enceladus generating methane from carbon dioxide so how do we find out well one way is to go back with better Mass spectrometers so the Cassini Mass spectrometer the inass one of the two had a mass resolution that uh could only tell you whether you were seeing something of mass 28 or 29 or 30 in other words unitary masses so if you had a mass 28 which Cassini did you couldn't tell whether you had carbon monoxide or nitrogen or ethylene they all have mass of 28 but modern Mass spectrometers that can be flown in space like mpex which is on its way to Europa get 100 times that resolution and so they can see the fractional masses associated with The Binding energy of these atoms in the molecule The Binding energy takes away Mass from the atoms and so you end up with what's called a mass defect and that's different for carbon monoxide then it is for nitrogen then it is from ethylene C2 H4 and so you can determine distinguish between all these molecules and just flying this through the plume of Enceladus would remove a huge number of ambiguities and allow us to say what the composition is and even whether there are amino acids present so Kelly Miller is the principal investigator for Mass specs for our Enceladus mission that we've been proposing and also the other Mass spectrometer the um uh the the mass spectrometer for the solids on Cassini was able to tell us that there are some sort of heavy Organics there as Morgan pointed out but not the identity of those and so flying something with much higher Mass resolution will get us the identity of these heavy Organics and furthermore with today's technology you can go out to much higher masses the mass range were in fact biological molecules heavy amino acids dipeptide peptides fatty acids Etc would be present so this is what we want to do we want to be able to measure amino acid and fatty acid abundances and distinguish between the biotic and abiotic abundance patterns so far it's been difficult to convince NASA to do this but we're all going to give it another try and Morgan cable is one of the key people on this uh Mission proposal beyond that landing on Enceladus is in the Enceladus orbe Lander concept that was proposed for the decadal survey that was led by Shannon McKenzie at APL um would be a way of collecting even more material than you could collect from the plume all right so let me finish with Titan so I'll be five minutes over I apologize all right so Titan is enormous right and if you look at Titan if you had something like this in the sky uh over Ithaca or New York wherever you say whoa what did I eat or what did I take uh it's larger than the planet Mercury it has a dense atmosphere 95% nitrogen the rest is methane Earth has a nitrogen atmosphere the rest is oxygen in the case of the earth water is the meteorological fluid that creates clouds and rain and rivers and Ice turns out on Titan because it's so far from the sun it's Saturn and so cold methane does exactly the same thing plays the same roles but the difference is that methane is the starting point for a rich organic chemistry so high in the atmosphere of Titan the density of the air of Titan's surface is four times denser than the air in this room so ultraviolet light or cosmic rays really don't get down to the surface few cosmic rays do but high in the atmosphere ultraviolet light can break up methane to form acetylene ethane and then a whole series of other hydrocarbons and because nitrogen is present the nitrogen can participate as well making hydrogen cyanide and that's the starting point for a whole Suite of nitriles and Emin and so there is this Rich organic chemistry that is known in Titan's atmosphere but not so well known yet on the surface these are all less volatile than methane so they condense out and rain out onto the surface the methane and the ethane are liquid at tighten surface temperatures of 94 Kelvin and evidence for methane liquid is found at all scales from the Cassini hyan Mission from the hyan probe descending by Parachute these three images put together show a dendritic uh feature on a hillside presumably carved by methane and when the hyan probe landed on the surface uh nearby out in this region because the bottom of it was warm and the mass spectrometer in Inlet was heated methane began pouring out of the surface methane and ethane so there is methane and ethane soaking the soil and carving these features on hundreds of kilometer scales lakes and seas discovered both by Imaging and by radar Titan's atmosphere is hazy so radar is really gives you the clearest images this is liia Mari 500 kilometers across which makes it as big as Enceladus is in total shows you how small Enceladus is and the Cassini radar was able to detect not only this this feature which is very smooth and very dark in radar but it could detect both the Reflection from the top and the Reflection from the Bottom of the Sea the time delay between the two gives you the depth so there's beety for these C's and the attenuation of the signal from the bottom relative to the top then gives you the composition using laboratory data and that composition is methane and ethane so now we know thanks to Cassini and lab data that these are methane ethane C's and then finally on the very largest scales seasonally when Titan reaches Equinox there's large scale rainfall in the equatorial regions which darken the surface on scales of thousands of kilometers and that is presumably due to methane as well so what is going on on the surface well that we know very little about the Cassini hyan Mass spectrometer could only tell us a limited amount but laboratory experiments show some very intriguing directions that in fact the organic chemistry on Titan could involve further Evolution on the surface so liquid ethane combined with Benzene uh can produce what's called a cocrystal and in some work by uh Vu cable and colleagues they show that this is what happen as the ethane uh as the lake dries up and uh what's left behind includes these sorts of co  crystals so they uh in a later paper by Morgan cable and colleagues postulate an entire organic minerology on the surface that is based on Association of different organic molecules with each other and this is totally different from anything we have on the earth and it begs the question where does chemical ution and on Titan surface Titan surface has diverse energy sources it has long temporal and large spatial scales it has a chemically Rich surface where Life as we know it can't exist there is no liquid water and so the chemistry is unimpeded by biology now in a paper uh led by Mike Wong in 20123 exploring the question of why the universe seems to evolve toward ever more complex and information Rich structures uh they pointed out and it's Mike Wong here in the audience that um that um the the the laws of physics that we have are alltime symmetric except for the second law of Thermodynamics and the second law of Thermodynamics doesn't tell you why systems become more complex and more information Rich so they postulated a missing law uh which uh is called the law of increasing functional information which certainly is applicable to biology and even minerology on the earth because minerals have evolve with time and maybe is applicable to all complex systems that have access to lots of energy and lots of time so Titan surface is a great place to test this idea to see whether the abundances of species that are on the surface do or don't obey uh the simple laws of chemistry to look for things that are not not uh uh defined in their abundance by simply free energy of formation but rather by this tendency for systems to evolve toward ever more complex structures so for example if we find graphine on the surface of Titan rather than cyanoacetylene graphine is an excellent storage uh molecule for hydrogen and would be a way for Titans surface and atmosphere to continue to reconstitute the methane that's been destroyed in the upper atmosphere so how are we going to find these molecules what are we going to do well flying a dual quadcopter or flying Rover or however you want to call it is the way to do it so this is dragonfly which is being developed by APL for launch to Titan in 2028 it has uh a chemical analysis system where material is brought in by uh literally a vacuum cleaner because there's air on Titan so can have a vacuum cleaner uh ziby turtle is the mission pi and this potentially could detect through its mass spectrometer the kinds of molecules that would be part of Titan minerology and maybe even part of an increasingly complex functional chemical system in the absence of life itself all right I want to just close now by pointing out one more Mission and one more place to go the Uranus system has five moons three of which may be uh or has five moons two or three of which may be ocean worlds we don't know Voyager two didn't get a great look at those moons but the Uranus Orbiter probe Mission came out of the planetary decadal survey which you heard about earlier this week from Morgan as the highest priority mission after Mars sample return and I was the panel chair for the panel that recommended this Mission the secret to being a good panel chair is to have a superb panel Vice chair uh who in this case was Amy Simon and she was the science Champion for this Mission and really carried the ball all the way and the vice chairs and the panels were actually on the steering committee as well whereas the chairs were not which was an interesting and good way to do things so this is beyond my time Horizon like the late 2040s but it's an opportunity to explore a completely new kind of planet that we haven't EXP explored well with spacecraft an ice Giant and uh I think that one the surprises that will be found uh are things that um as with earlier Planetary Exploration we just cannot predict thank you so I know some of you have to set up your lightning talk so please feel free to if you have to do that don't worry about that I'll actually start with the questions um hi Alexia kubis Cornell I had a science question actually about the the Platypus platypus chaos feature you mentioned that you think that's a thin region of the ey shell I was wonder if you could just expand upon why we think that because I would think just with tital heat dissipation dissipation and rotational Dynamics I would expect like the poles to maybe be thinner yeah so um that's of course a speculation don't know if it's thinner area but the Platypus is located in a region where there uh is a very large number of fractures and ridges that look very very young uh and so that's an area that can be contrasted with for example uh the area where the one big Crater of uh an Europa is PU uh PW y l and that has to be an area of very thick crust uh because the crater itself is I think 30 kilometers across and has to be maintained uh so we don't see craters like that in those U heavily fractured areas so presumably the crust is thinner than it is over in the one place that has craters now whether that's the thinnest area I don't really know but what is interesting is that it's an area where there appears to be these these s things these smudgy things that have come out of the fractures which presumably were Organics or salts that were then deposited on the surface and radiation darkened so those had to come out of some sort of liquid if they were from a plume and that also suggests a relatively thin area where the the heat has either liquefy the crust itself or the ocean is actually under there but we won't know the answer to that until you rope a Clipper so you could be right it could be the poles are the thinnest but that's something that Europa Clipper will definitely tell us and it's super important to understand that if we're going to go back with a Lander to look for biology great thank you are there okay have microphone hi sir I'm I'm sha a post dog from George Washington University and also I am a a professor in India assistant professor so as being a professor my question is like first of all very uh motivational and inspirational and knowledgeable talk that was and my question is like you in your early phases of uh like job you might have faced some institutional competitions like sort of things so uh how did I want just an advice for that because for science I can talk in personal outside but for that I want to know that if if you want to give any advice like how to face these institutional competitions and yeah the patent uh preservations right so the question is about institutional competition at a time before you actually have tenure um competition within a department for example um so I was very fortunate to be at an institution the lunar and planetary lab of the University of Arizona which was not Cutthroat in other words they hired faculty with the intention that those faculty would gain tenure after six or seven years and there wasn't a sense of trying to weed out faculty and you know in the United States Harvard has been the classic example of places where you know people don't get tenure they won't give you tenure unless you're the best of the best Carl Sean was an assistant professor at Harvard and didn't get tenure and that's why he ended up at Cornell but I wasn't in a place like that and so I felt that um I was being well supported as a professor however I had a colleague who came in a year before me Carolyn Porco very famous planetary scientist team leader for the Cassini Imaging team and she was also an assistant professor and she didn't feel supported because she was a woman and the faculty with one exception were all men and looking back at it you could see that she was not supported that it was a tougher environment for her so she decided she could best do her science from a private entity Space Science Institute and so she left and uh so today the intent and the goal should always be to support everyone regardless of their identity what's important is that they are human beings doing science and teaching um and you know I look back at that time and realized that the support that I got was not universally applied to others in particular my good friend who was just a year ahead of me in the whole process so I don't know how that applies to India because I don't know India very well I applies or I'll try here Al hope thank you so much you're [Music] welcome thank you um hi I'm ades from um Georgia Tech I'm a graduate student just joined um Georgia Tech so I had two questions one non science and one science but I'll go to the non science question first you said that um well graduate school is like really the pivotal point in like any any person's like who's like a graduate student at this point it it'll be their pivotal point in their career so it you also said that it es and flows so like how do you deal with like days when you just don't feel like going to the lab or like working right right yeah um so when I was a graduate student there was a period when I had too many of those days and I ended up just like going to the wait room for example uh when I should have been at colloquium seminars that was one of the things that I kind of got criticized for but um you have to the I think you know that was a particular circumstance so there will be days when you have normal burnout and you don't feel like working and you just accept that you don't feel like working and you let people know that and say I you know I just need a a self care day and that's okay because by and large today and you can contradict me if this is not true I think that faculty and research supervisors are more sensitive to that than they were 20 or 30 years ago at least I hope so if you get to the point though where you really feel like you just can't go in where you know days go by and and you're really stuck then it's time to try to um to get some kind of help and you know most universities in the United States um there student health services which can be helpful their friends um if you have a good relationship with your Mentor you can talk to your Mentor but the important point is to be honest with yourself and recognize when you're really beyond the point of just having a bad day and you need to do something to um to to cure yourself to take care of yourself that's not an easy thing to do I mean a lot of times we don't realize when we're depressed or um run down in some way that's pretty serious so having friends who are willing to let you know that that's the case that's that's important too people who can look at you and say you know hey what's going on so friends are super important in grad school and understanding mentors and if your mentors is not understanding and there other mentors you know think about going to them okay thank you that was like really insightful so the second question is like I assume all of these missions that you talked about this is like dynamic in nature so the objectives of those missions would like change over time as you discover more and more data so how does that work out like how what is the pipeline for like if you like have like some data from like one of those missions how does that change the perspective for the next um I don't know flyby or something right that's very good okay so the question is about the Dynamics the missions and the fact how do you account for what you've learned from let's say a previous flyby for the next flyby and it really depends upon how versatile the mission is so Cassini Cassini Orbiter part of the Cassini hyan mission was very very flexible you could change the orbit by adjusting the way that the spacecraft flew by Titan and that would change the orbit so in that case there would be um meetings of the project science group and the instrument teams to evaluate what was learned and use that to plan not necessarily the next flyby but you know five or 10 flybys of Titan further on down not just for exploring Titan but for example for going into the plume of Enceladus so when the plume was discovered by Cassini by the Imaging instrument and the magnetometer uh in 2004 and 2005 the project science group immediately formed a tiger team to answer the question how close could you fly to Enceladus how deep in the plume could you fly without wiping out the spacecraft from the particulates in the plume and that required doing more remote sensing from cassinii to model the size distribution from the scattering of light uh and it required the engineers to say what was the maximum Siz particle that could hit the spacecraft without damage and that took about a year and after that it was determined yeah you could fly started out at 100 kilm and then worked down and subsequent flybys to 49 km so I guess the lesson in that is having a big team and having a very flexible spacecraft which really means a flagship Mission uh gives you the most flexibility uh missions that are more focused more limited have a smaller mission team there's less ability to respond to discoveries in the same way and I think Cassini was the Apex I mean it it would make discoveries and then follow up on those discoveries the way that I described you're welcome maybe thank you so much for for your talk um Lily rinth University of Arizona LPL um uh I am curious what your um highest priorities are going into your role um now at JPL and then what science you're most excited about okay great so question was what are my highest priorities going in as Chief scientist so the nice thing about this position is it's not a line management position I don't have to manage Departments of scientists it's really a strategic planning position and right now my view is that jpl's relationship to to NASA to uh other to universities and so forth is not as good as it could be particularly to NASA so really high priority is trying to reestablish those good relationships that that JPL has had at times in the past it's a national resource uh even though there are other places that fly planetary missions they all have their own particular skills and jpl's ability to land spacecraft on Mars for example Rove around do things like that really is unparallel so being able to rebuild that trust is very very important and as far as which science is really interesting so of course I'm a planetary scientist but I have to say that um I've always so I've been involved in astronomy and astrophysics I have some time on James web Space Telescope of course as we all are I've always I've been concerned about the environment of our home planet and I actually did a little bit of work uh some papers on Stratosphere tropospheric change with Don Hunton and I wrote a textbook on the earth so I have a pretty broad view of what's interesting what I'm actually looking forward to is learning about science that I haven't had a chance to focus on and getting really interested and excited in those areas uh and to be able to represent and articulate those areas as well as planetary science welcome thank you all right I have a question so I'm going to step yes on the side of the mic now um in reference to the first part of your talk more of your journey and how you got here do you have any advice for us that are kind of finishing our graduate career but are unclear of what step to take next particularly Academia or industry sure um so in my particular case I was very sure what I wanted to do so I don't have the um the experience of being unsure I really wanted to go into Academia um but I've had graduate students have have gone into industry as well well and have made that decision at times almost at the last minute I mean I had a graduate student uh who graduated in 2016 who had a job offer at JPL as an exoplanet um uh post doctoral fellow and had a job offer at JP Morgan so for him it was JPL or JPM and he picked JPM but he picked it almost at the last minute so I I think the the advice that I would give is if you're unsure of what you want to do after grad school just plan on applying to different kinds of jobs just the way that uh my student did dong Wong uh and you know you can I mean you can coming out of your disertation you can apply to post doctoral positions you can apply to Industry at the same time um you don't have to apply to just one kind of thing and so that's one way to do it is just to hedge your bets the way that he did and if you've got you're unsure whether it's going to be academic or Research Center industry just apply to jobs in in all of those if you want to be able to plan ahead a little bit more then depending upon whether you're two years out from finishing or one year out you should start talking to people in those different kinds of areas you should reach out to people in Industry who have phds in in astronomy or something else and very often often your Mentor or another faculty member in the department will know people will have contacts that will allow you to to make those connections and then really just talk to them about what those careers are like and most people are very interested in talking about you know what they're doing and what their job is like and so uh definitely if you've got a little bit of time plan on reaching out for people in industry in Academia and find out what their experiences are like and that may help you you to make make your decision and don't be afraid of the fact that you're uncertain about it because you know often times the the most rewarding things come out of the most uncertain times in life either in research or in just life itself uh I mean that happened with the whole Italy thing which turned out for us to be kind of a disaster and so I ended up here so you know don't be afraid of those uncertainties but information is power so be sure to to talk to people in those different kinds of fields hope that's helpful okay I one um so I love the way you ended this talk this was really cool and when I did AB gradon in The Proposal writing Retreat last year I wrote about like a geochemical investigation of Uranus's moons and I think it seemed cool because it uh it felt like something that you know wouldn't necessarily get a lot of funding uh in real life so this question quick one uh inspired by Veronica she asked this to group at sparked a heated discussion what do you think is the most overrated and underrated ocean world or potential ocean world I think we would all like to know and then I'll hand it off to AB the most okay um so probably it's easier maybe to start with the most overrated um I I think it's going to turn out that Triton is going to be the most overrated ocean world because I think that we're going to find that that ocean is sandwiched between layers of high pressure ice at the bottom and of course the ice at the top that doesn't matter but once you have ice intervening Between the Ocean and the silic then you have a tough time getting nutrients to organisms that's true for Titan of course Titan wouldn't be interesting at all if it didn't have these methane lakes and seas the ocean itself is not so interesting and Triton is like just on the boundary of this depending on how you model it so I'm gonna that's what I'm gonna oh are you working on Triton no I just love trit oh I love Triton too I mean I you know Voyager that was the Triton part of the Voyager Neptune encounter was what I I worked on um but Pluto is not underrated because Pluto is less massive than Triton and so it's ocean might in fact be in contact with rocks so that that is all good the most underrated that's really hard to for a long time Enceladus was underrated people were saying oh it's too small there's not enough you know it can't circulate nutrients it's just sort of a a dead world and I think when the phosphates were discovered in the Cassini data recently and published by post bodol people began to change their minds on that um and then I would just say that that I think the Uranian moons are perhaps not underrated but neglected and if we do get to Uranus with the Uranus orbit or probe going to find out that there are really ocean worlds there so and I want to apologize to Triton and all Triton files because I love Triton too but you put me on the spot so I yeah okay all right all right hi uh Abby during Georgia Tech um I just wanted to ask you about about Outreach and um science communication experiences that I mean you've obviously benefited from but um things that you're participating in or things that you might recommend that we as early crew scientists might want to participate in yeah um the answer is I don't really know um in terms of programs that are available today uh I'm not actually the world's best speaker and I um have myself tried to improve by taking singing lessons for example uh which really does help in terms of voice control and your graduate programs may have courses in in public speaking uh I know we had we had that at Caltech um but in terms of actual Outreach programs that you could sign up for I have to say I don't know but you should definitely talk to some of the people across the way in the opag meeting because NASA undoubtedly has some so I'm I'm really sorry but I just have to be honest and say I don't know okay all right I'm Sam Hi Sam University of Minnesota so I've never LED or proposed a NASA space mission um but I imagine it involves a lot of talking in some sense that you have a lot to make a lot of very complicated very high stakes decisions you have a lot of people involved with different backgrounds my question is do you have any suggestions for to lead productive meetings in those situations where you have to make high stakes complicated decisions with a lot of people involved you had this list of all the proposed projects and the projects that actually happened you're involved in yes and I see Decades of meeting happen yes absolutely absolutely right okay um so first and foremost I would say it's a really important skill to be able to lead meetings and it's related to this Outreach question uh as well who oh hi yeah uh what was your name Abby Dear Abby so aby's question uh there are actually some really good programs at most universities on how to lead meetings and conduct meetings the Kryptonite that I referred to earlier in my talk for me was related to that and it I had a bad habit of waiting to say something that would be really clever and I would say it and then I would follow it up because it was so so clever was something really stupid and that would derail meetings and it would derail relationships so and that's just one example that was by kryptonite that angeleta told me about she was Italian so she used the term stupid doy uh which is much more colorful than yeah um so you can get training in how to run meetings at your University uh I don't know where you're at but Minnesota in Minnesota I mean there are definitely uh programs like that uh sometimes through the university sometimes through graduate student council but you should definitely look for those and it's a super important skill to be able to sit with a group of people and really listen to what they're saying and be able to uh to incorporate that back I mean one way to to to say that is the Lara technique where you listen you affirm uh you sort of uh renew um this L uh um you react to what they say you listen to what they say you affirm what they say you react to it and then you add to it uh so that you're not driving the conversation you're you're accom incorporating what everyone else is saying so anyway that's about public speaking and listening really really important as far as leading a mission goes um you don't want to sort of jump into that too early in your career because it is an incredibly time consuming and emotionally draining thing the first time that we proposed elf in 201 um 16 i' had been the deputy Pi on another mission I'd gotten a lot of experience with that that really helped me but I still totally freaked out halfway through the process when things were falling apart because it's so complicated you really want to start with uh research analysis proposals to NASA you could start with small instrument proposals and then build to uh small missions for example and that way you build the uh experience without destroying yourself I mean being rejected after working for you know two years on something like this is really devastating so you want to start with something where the stakes are not quite so high that's what I recommend but I I think it's great that you're interested in doing that and hopefully there'll be many opportunities ahead and there's now there's there are new categories of planetary missions now smaller than Discovery Missions at Nasa and that I think will really help build a a much larger Cadre of potential pis for the bigger missions thank yeah okay yeah hi I'm good the microphone the battery go out I'm pretty loud okay um there it is yeah I was wondering for the future like what would like what what finding would justify a landing mission on any of these moons right and the role of privatization okay great it is that's all those are both great questions so one is what would justify a Lander and and privatization okay super so for number one I'll take Europa and in the case of Europa if the Europa Clipper is able to identify with it spectrometers places on the surface where there are there's fresh material amino acids or organic compounds that have not been Fried by radiation then those are areas where material is regularly coming up from below that is Europa goes around in its eccentric orbit which is what's responsible for in part for the ocean the tidal Heating the cracks open and close uh stuff comes out if if places can be identified where that material is coming out and there places where you can actually put a Lander that would really justify your rope a Lander um Enceladus I you know I think we can get a lot from the a plume fly through Mission so I think we really want to do that first privatization so right now the value proposition in space flight for doing doing deep space science is very very difficult you can justify uh a business can justify getting involved in uh low earth orbit and even lunar operations because there are lots of contracts available um but Private Industry actually does participate in very key aspects of these planetary missions usually a subcontractors so honeybee robotics for example which is relatively or was a relatively small company is the company that designed this vacuum system for collecting material from the surface of Titan for dragonfly and so there is a definitely these days role for small businesses uh as well as larger ones having a private company do a planetary Mission there have been a lot of false starts including when I was at the University of Arizona whoever is there now I saw her yep hi so there was an entrepreneur who had made a lot of money and came to the director of the lab and said that he was going to do a private asteroid Mission and the lab got involved with him and it didn't not only didn't it get off the ground but it didn't even get to what we call phase a at that point so it's economically it's tough to to really have Private Industry do the whole thing yep okay we're going to respect the time of the opag meeting and our colleagues presenting there so but Mary Juliana has been waiting here here so we're going to give last question um and then we'll all head off to the I'll do a super short answer so good okay could be a short question um so yeah and I go by Anna Wayan um from Memorial University of New Finland you talked a lot about your mentors and I'm wondering if you have any insights of how you know a mentor is not for you so yes uh you have to you have to so thank you Anna you have to really trust your early impressions of that Mentor you know if that Mentor is very dismissive or doesn't want to spend time or doesn't listen to you um those are real warning signs uh it's really good to have some sort of a mentoring agreement or contract with your Mentor uh in some places that's required now but you definitely want to test your Mentor out by seeing if they're willing to draw up some kind of a mentoring agreement to deal with various things if they say no that's another warning sign some of these defects are fixable you know you might say to your Mentor you're really not paying attention to what I'm talking about maybe they'll correct it um but if you see that repeatedly then you might want to go look for someone else thank you all right okay thank you e [Music] [Music]
