what is your favorite thing that life on Earth does as a microbiologist the thing that fascinates me most about life is the connection between life and the non living world and how sometimes that delineation is kind of fuzzy especially at the microscopic level microbes are constantly taking non living matter and turning it into living matter and then decomposing living matter back into inorganic material and it's this constant cycling of minerals water gases into living material that just absolutely fascinates me and I love that really everything on this planet life and all the non living things as well are interconnected and I just think that that's incredibly fascinating
