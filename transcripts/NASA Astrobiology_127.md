[Music] our second keynote speaker of the conference holds the Chancellor's distinguished profession professorship in physics at UCSD he's a theoretical physicist whose work is wide ranging and whose Twitter bio says I'm interested in everything before joining UCSD he was at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign for over 30 years where he led the biocomplexity group within the Carl R woes Institute for genomic biology and where he both founded and directed the NASA astrobiology Institute for Universal biology his research has been highly multidisciplinary ranging from condensed matter and hydrodynamics to the ecology and evolution of living systems among his many accolades Nigel received the 2020 leop kadenoff prize from the American physical Society for quote profound contributions to the fields of superconductivity fluid turbulence and dynamical pattern formation it's been a pleasure to have him as a professor and it's a pleasure to have him with us here today please welcome Nigel goldenfeld happy birthday [Applause] thank you very much for the kind and invitation to speak at Brad Khan I love this conference I've sent my students to it I've been in it before I think it's absolutely wonderful and I was really thrilled to see that NASA is still supporting it and even to uh to uh to catch up with an old friend and acquaintance from my days at the NASA astrobiology Institute hi Mike so I'm going to talk about something that uh that by All rights shouldn't exist and I don't mean life itself and I mean uh Universal aspects of living systems I'm a physicist as you heard from the introduction and so my approach to anything is is ridiculously as simple and is almost surely destined for failure but we try to fail in a in a grand way and at least see what we can learn from our attempts to understand uh the physical principles that govern uh life so I'm going to talk about Universal biology the genetic code in the first billion years of life on Earth and I have uh collaborators my first collaborate I want to mention is a Carl woes who will feature in this story and many of you may know Carl woes he discovered the Arca he was a very famous evolutionary biologist and he was my mentor when I started doing biology about 20 years ago I was one of my graduate students who did a fantastic work on the generic code and was in fact also at the University of Wisconsin where Alex was as a as a student before um uh Apache Jaffa is now uh as a in in the Netherlands and tomato bianchalani is now working in a genotech here in California all right so I'm going to tell you about work that was done uh over the last uh uh 10 or 10 or 15 years or so through the NASA astrobiology Institute and I hope you're going to find it interesting if you have any questions feel free to interrupt during the during the talk especially if it's a clarification and I'll be of course be happy to take questions as as we go through to the end so the thing I want to understand is what are the sorts of evolutionary transitions that life most inevitably pass through this is part of a program that the NASA uh discussed in The Marvelous astrobiology roadmap from about 15 years ago trying to understand a universal biology and look for Universal characteristics of life and the idea is if we can understand what features of life on Earth are not idiosyncratic but actually just something that we should expect from another planet and understanding these processes understanding these transitions may help us to come up with uh biosignatures and we'll see that in fact there are some prospects for that so I want to understand basically can we understand some features of Life Universal features which you may say may not exist but we'll see we'll see it's the country and can we understand from general dynamical principles without necessarily having to worry about all the chemical details so I'm going to talk about two things in this talk I'm going to talk about uh the canonical genetic code and that's going to be most the most of my talk I will talk about biological homochiality because it is important as a as a bio signature it's been assumed to be a biosignature but um but actually we'll see in this talk that actually there are dynamical reasons for thinking that homocolity isn't inevitable outcome of living systems so I want to first start off though by talking about are there any universal features in biology and and how should we think about them so I'm a physicist so I start off by asking is there universality in physics so here's an example this is thermal conductivity or various uh glassy materials this is raw data and then when we process it in a certain way the data from different materials all collapse onto one uh Universal curve except for this regime over here and so that's something that we try to understand if we want to understand glassly and glassy materials here's another example which is a much better one this example is looking at the magnetic field or the magnetization in a magnet exposed to an external magnetic field H at temperature t as you go through the ferromagnetic phase transition the transition that makes stuff be magnetic at low temperatures and not magnetic at high temperatures and you the data you take from a different external magnetic fields different uh temperatures and then if you process the data in the right way all these data from five different materials none of which are look anything alike all fall onto one universal curve and the prediction for that curve is the solid line which goes embarrassingly close to all the data and it has no adjustable parameters so that's another example of of scaling and universality in physics and you might say well this is this is really great because what did the physicists do they made a model of a magnetic system and then they took that model worked out its consequences did some calculations and then showed that it gave a precise prediction in agreement with experiments that's what physicists usually do in fact it's nothing like that at all but actually it is it's a model of a model of a model of a model of a model and that that does all the work the first model is a model of quantum chemistry then there's a model of electronic structure then there's a model of the dipole moment on the electronic spins that uses quantum mechanics and then you say well quantum mechanics is too hard so let's get rid of quantum mechanics and then you have a classical and you still can't do it and only make some sort of approximation that position to call Landau Theory and then you you get the results that I showed you and the thing you want I want you to understand the reason why I'm uh tormenting you with this physics stuff is because every step along the way here is a non systematic approximation you cannot justify these approximations starting from first principles from the Schrodinger equation or whatever else it is so the point is here is an example of how a ludicrously simple model that has no right to actually be able to describe reality actually describes it precisely and we know in this case why it works it works in this case because of a thing called renormalization group Theory which Ken Wilson won the Nobel Prize for inventing in the 1980s and so we understand how all these approximations that we made throw away stuff that really doesn't matter for the thing that we were trying to calculate so that's the uh so that that tells you that it is not impossible to make ludicrously simple models and still have some understanding of how the system actually behaves okay so but we're going to of course apply that type of modeling philosophy uh to biology but first of all let's ask another question so for me as a physicist I want to know do we learn new physics when we study biology or is it just insanely complicated Material Science are they Universal phenomena do they reveal anything important and what do we miss by not understanding Universal phenomena okay I'm going to show you that the high Universal phenomena some of you will be very surprised at the examples I'm going to show you I'm also going to show you that if we don't understand these Universal phenomena not only can we not understand how life started at all and how it evolved we certainly can't understand how to do things like respond to a pandemic or deal with antibiotic resistance or herbicide doesn't or Cancer all of these things depend on understanding Evolution and these Universal properties okay so let's talk about Universal biology so so uh let me give you an example here so this was uh this was a headline on the NASA website at some point uh 2013 about 10 years ago mystery of the missing waves on Titan so basically people knew that from looking at the uh at uh the flow mechanics and and the atmosphere of Titan that there should be uh waves on on the surface of Titan um and uh and uh so there was a mystery they weren't there we couldn't see them nobody knew why and then about a year later uh Cassini Spies The wind rippled Waves uh on Titan so so suddenly sign of relief thank goodness you you can sleep at night we found the waves on the surface of the oceans of Titan okay so that's a real real headline okay here's what here's one that you have Okay so I just forget I forgot this we know the waves on the ocean of Titan are missing because there's a general theory of two phase fluid flow interfaces but predict waves and the dispersion characteristics so we knew what to look for okay here's a headline that you didn't see mystery of the missing life on Titan and then definitely not this one Cassini Spies The long sort Life on Titan okay anybody seen that headline it never occurred okay and it's a joke right because it's a joke because we don't know if there's a missing life because we don't have a theory that predicts the existence of Life as a physical phenomena so that's the first thing why does life as a phenomenon exist and we certainly don't understand what sort of Life can exist in different uh environments so so um so so so actually going back to going back to Cassini Cassini May indeed have actually seen life but not on Titan it may have seen life okay so how many people here know about Enceladus great a lot more a lot more people than word as a typical physics colloquium right so so good so so as you know insolidos is a is an isolated World orbiting Saturn um it has a global ocean of liquid water underneath the ice and we know that because we can see how it wobbles and because of the way it wobbles we can detect there must be life underneath there must be water underneath and it also obligingly has a crack in the ice lots of cracks and so water squirts out through the cracks and so you've got a fountain a huge fountain and you can fly satellites through the fountain and you can look at the water that you uh that you pick up and that water you can analyze it's chemistry and its chemistry looks very similar to what we might see as an alkaline hydrothermal vent here on Earth so we Cassini wasn't instrumented for looking at life but we may have seen some signatures of life through that experiment so what is what is also biology well Universal biology is the idea that we are interested in general principles and not specific carbon chemistry details and so we want to develop a theory of universal biology divorced from idiosyncratic details of the actual chemistry and the and the geological context and so on and this will involve abstractions and and we use abstractions all the time in in biology and we'll talk about one of those in a minute so this slide is pretty much all we know about Universal biology so are you looking at it carefully there's not much there so let's talk instead about something where we do have an understanding and that is universal computation so I want to tell you now about what we what a universal biology would look like if we could do it and we use as a Model A computer so here is a picture of my computer or something close to my computer here's another computer this one you can see a few hundred miles up the road at the Museum of computation in Mountain View or in my case I saw it at the science museum in London this is a computer made out of COG wheels and springs designed and partially built by George Babbage in the 1900s it is the authentic steampunk artifact these two things are the same they're the same algorithmically this thing over here the left hand side is a computer and you know that it's uh not uh just a shiny chunk of glass plastic and silicon it's actually a universal turing machine the thing on the right is also a turing machine because it has conditional branching in its instruction set and so it can be shown that it can be mapped onto a universal turing machine so in fact the two things are the same although one of them is at many times faster than the other so the turing machine with an online architecture is really what a computer is and we have Hardware to instantiate uh that uh that algorithm so the medium is not the message here is John Von Neumann standing in front of another computer that he built at The Institute for advanced study in the 1950s in this computer it's built out of thermionic valves it's built out of relays and switches and so neither this nor this we're seeing here the evolution of computational Hardware but in all of these machines they all do the same thing they're all Universal Turing machines and so we're looking at life we should be thinking about life as making a progression as you see over here but executing the same sort of algorithmic processes now these are new physical laws in in biology well uh Schrodinger and Dell Brooke were the first physicists to work in biology and their partial motivation was to find new physical laws they were thinking about quantum mechanics in the 1930s as they might see some deviations from quantum mechanics or something like that but today we not many people well some people think that could be still true but most of us think that uh big question is trying to understand emergence and the existence of life itself how is it that matter at molecules and atoms are self organize hierarchically create replicating and evolvable structures we don't have a clue about how that happens how do molecules come to life so if you want to understand biology in the same way that we understand physical phenomena we need to understand the existence and not just the specific realization of of living systems and I'm going to take the perspective here that living systems are dynamical systems that are able to reprogram themselves so let's think about that so here is the uh here is the fortune cookie the program is the data the data is the program okay this is Niels barricelli who was uh the first person to write a computer virus he was working at The Institute for advanced study and in the day while John Von Neumann was using the computer one of the first computers to uh solve the equations of hydrodynamics to design uh hydrogen bombs uh Niels banacelli went in at night and made a computer viruses and then had them compete and and evolve with each other inside a fixed ecosystem which was the memory of the of the computer and here he understood what he was seeing here was uh was actually being of the phenomena that we see in evolving evolvable ecosystems so what do self programming systems uh can do well living systems have the capacity to evolve and evolving systems can reprogram themselves so they're able to respond to perturbations by creating new functionality that is the defining characteristic of living systems and this is very different from physical systems or engineered systems which are by a fixed or predetermined uh equation of motion or or behavior so the future state of an evolvable system is inherently unpredictable and never maybe girdle undecidable don't worry about that and so this this uh this this feature means that it's very difficult to control evolving systems and we'll come to that we'll turn to that at the end of The Talk now what do most biologists do well most biologists uh do something rather strange you could call it the inverse problem imagine that you came down from Mars and I gave you my computer and you had no idea what this thing was what would you be able to do to figure out that this thing is not just a an expensive door stop but actually as a universal turing machine with a vulnerable human architecture it would be very very different very very difficult to figure out from the electronic circuits and the hardware and so on but that's what the thing actually did and so what we want to do in biology is we have the inverse problem the biology is already created and we want to understand one is the abstract theory of which it is an instantiation and that abstract Theory would underline all systems that exhibit the characteristics of life so could you could you if you didn't know about the universal Turing machines with a Von Neumann architecture could you deduce a theoretical framework just by somebody giving you to a highly evolved computer okay we've talked about abstraction so now let's get down to a real abstraction so I want to talk about the genetic code and I figuratively find that people from various wide ranging audiences don't quite know what I mean when I talk about the genetic code so let's just take a pause to uh to go through that so in the modern world as you know DNA contains our genome and the DNA is built from four nucleotide bases RNA polymerase reads the the gene coding segments some spits out mRNA that's also built from four nucleotide bases and then the ribosomes go along with the MRNA and they spit out the proteins and they choose which proteins should go into the protein the issues which amino acids should go into the proteins from the code that they're reading from the from the MRNA and the way they read that code is they read it in triplets so a u g a c a GGG and so on these are codon Triplets of of of nucleotide bases and the genetic code it tells you if you read this thing here what amino acid is going to go into the into the protein that you're building and so this is a sort of cartoon here of the whole translation process and you're supposed to think of this huge machine uh moving along like so so just to summarize what the genetic code is it's a map it's a map used by the ribosome to translate the message from n1a Triplets of four bases into the 20 amino acids of life and uh and and we're going to discuss uh how that code evolved now this is Carl woes sitting uh in his office on and on the New York Times front page Thursday November the 3rd 1977. why is he there well it says here scientists discover a form of life that predates higher organisms and I guess fake news is not just a new invention it happened uh it happened back in the 70s as well this is partially true not not not not quite true but in any case he had discovered uh the uh the archaea so let me just tell you uh what he had discovered so this is the tree of life this is from a paper by Norm Pace in 97 now you can see here there are three domains the bacteria the archaea and the eukaryotes you are over here virtually everything else here is is microbial and uh the and this this this phylogenetic tree is a kind of map it's built it's been elaborated on by now and there's there's uh it's it's out of date and there's uh some debates about whether there's two domains or three domains and so on and so forth but fundamentally this is what uh what he discovered now how did he uh how did he discover this well what he did was looked for patterns in uh in in molecular sequences from parts of the ribosome the 16s small subunit of the ribosome and by looking at those sequences was able to look at do the what what today would call comparative genomics and map out uh the the this tree of life and some around here is uh the last Universal common ancestor or the last Universal common ancestral community so this is the paper that they wrote in in 1977 and uh the the mystery that this uh this this work um uh left us with is the following we know that the planet is about 4.6 billion years old we know that the the last Universal common ancestor even then was uh was dated to at least three billion years today we think it's about 3.6 3.8 billion years depending on who you're talking to based on uh static um you know um um what do you call them um you know if they're various geological evidence and and so on for matalites and so on um so so basically but something like this but but the point that that woes and fox were making is that a lot of the of the time the planet was inhospitable to life you had less than a billion years in which life could evolve and it evolved the complexity of something like the modern cell in less than a billion years and then after that there wasn't very much cellular Evolution maybe dinosaurs or multicellularity and things like that but from a point of view of the architecture of the cell uh very little so so what uh What uh uh woes and fox uh here's some pictures of them doing their work at the time uh what they what they uh what they wrote was that uh that it wasn't that the evolution speeded up at the beginning and then slowed down uh the last Universal common ancestor what they wrote was that actually maybe Evolution had a different character um in its early phases and we're going to see that there is evidence for that now what kind of different mode could there be of evolution well most of us when you think about Evolution you think about what is really called vertical Evolution that is you have your genes you give your genes to your children they give their genes to their children and so on and so forth and so there's a a transfer of genetic material of genes through the generations horizontal Gene transfer is a different thing altogether horizontal Gene transfer is the transfer of genes from one organism to another that it is not related to and I and this is uh this is what happens uh in in bacteria there's three ways that this can are known to happen here on Earth genes can be transmitted through viruses through direct contact or through uptake of free DNA from the environment so the question is what happens when all the all the microbes in the world do this what happens when all of early life is able to uh to transfer genes okay let me just give you two quick uh anecdotes about that so this here is a cyanophage it's a it's a phage that's in in facts uh prochlorococcus one of the most abundant organisms of the planet and uh and and this here is a is a phylogenetic tree of the of a gene that is involved in the in photosystem too and if you can read phylogenetic trees it doesn't matter if you can't but if you can read them what this shows you is that this Gene was transferred back and forth between a virus and the bacterial host multiple times during evolution and in fact the the the group that discovered this solid metal in planetism's lab they wrote that to host like genes acquired by phages undergo a period of diversification and phase genomes and serve as a genetic reservoir for their hosts so the idea is I have a gene that is a photosynthesis Gene that that Gene helps in photosynthesis that Gene gets transferred by a viral attack to phage in phage that Gene can evolve much more rapidly because there are less proof readings and things like this that go on in Phase replication so as a result the bacteria are get infected by new genes from the phage but those genes have evolved much more rapidly in the phase than the wooden bacteria and so there's a there's a mechanism by which you could have rapid evolutionary change mediated by phage or by other mechanisms of horizontal Gene transfer and because that is a network effect it's extraordinarily efficient and uh and um I'm not going to have time to show you work that we did actually modeling that that whole process now this is the uh the uh with that having said that and told you about an other mode of transfer let me now tell you about the genetic code so here is the genetic code so the way you read it is like this you you and then the First Column up here so that brings you to this cell that's phenylalanyl in and you can do the same thing for all of these of course it's a it's a it's a code of triplets of for a nucleotide basis an alphabet of four so in principle there are 64 things you could code for but there's only 20 amino acids so the code is redundant and uh but it's not just redundant it also has structure so if you look here these are the most hydrophobic amino acids these are the most hydrophilic ones and you can see that in the way that this code is written there is structure here the amino acids have are segmented in this in this uh in this genetic code table so one of the things that Carl was did back in the 1960s was to measure a quantity that he called polar acquirement which measured this balance between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity and gave a single number which is small upper over here and large over here and and so he was able to quantify that chemical difference now you all know that the genetic code is pretty much Universal it's not exactly Universal there's small variations and stop codons but it's basically Universal but what I want to tell you now is something that you may not know about and that is that the genetic code is pretty much optimal in minimizing errors okay so let's let's uh let's discuss what we mean by that so let's suppose that you were given the task of of Designing intelligently a genetic code okay well you might say well translation is fundamentally important to a cellular operation so we want to make sure that any any mistakes any mutations or any misreadings give you an amino acid which is pretty close in chemical properties to the one that you should have got and if you could design a code like that then then that would be great okay it would be robust to errors so the question is is our genetic code like that I'm going to show you that it is so here's the actual genetic code so what you can do is you can make in the computer alternative genetic codes just by permuting the labels so here I'm permuting the label so I get new codes I'll be it with the same pattern of degeneracy there's 20 factorial which is about 10 to the 18 possible genetic code that you could have in the computer okay so now I can say all right I've made this whole Suite of genetic codes how good are they at minimizing errors and uh and there's a way that you can you can compute that and I'm not going to go into the exact metric that one uses so there's a way that one can do that so then one can ask well what should be the output if we take all our genetic codes that we've constructed in the computer measure how good they are at minimizing errors and then plot the probability distribution how many times we see a particular code with a particular score and minimizing errors and the smaller the the number here is on the horizontal axis the better the code is at minimizing error okay so one possibility that you could have is something like this you've got some you know Bells roughly bell shaped curve and uh and then you that's what you would get for any random genetic code and then you look at the actual genetic code it happens to be here in the middle in this uh in this sketch and so you would say okay well if that's what happens then that means that the current genetic code is just a frozen accident there were some ancestral organism it by accident it happens to be the one that we're all descended from all life on Earth it had some genetic code we all have the same genetic code as it because if we had a different genetic code then we'd be mistranslating our genomes we'd be getting the long amino acids and the wrong proteins and so we wouldn't survive and so the code must be what Francis Crick in 1968 called a frozen accident it's an accident because it just comes from whatever was the last Universal common ancestor and it's frozen because if it evolves the changes that it would happen would be deadly well the other option is something like this you've got a bell shaped curve like this and then the attribution of the code is somewhere down here in the Tails and if that's true then that says heck the genetic code that we have is not a frozen accident it had to have have evolved so here are the data this was a these data taken from an experiment that was done by freelance Hearst in 1998 so they they generated 1 million genetic codes and they scored them in a way they're like I'm not going to go into in detail and the actual genetic code is way way down here in the tail so all these random codes look nothing like this actual universal genetic code the canonical genetic code and so the title of their paper was the genetic code is one in a million can you generate a million genetic codes and and they're all worse than the one that we actually have at minimizing translation hours actually we know that actually it's actually more more like a hundred times uh better than that okay so now we have to ask the question how did the genetic code get like this how is it possible for the code to evolve because Florence is quick already told us that it can't evolve if you so if you change the genetic code you're going to start making the wrong amino acids you make your own amino acids you make the wrong proteins everything dies so we have to figure out how to do it and and this is what we did uh in in this paper over here and I want to walk you through not I'm not going to go into any of the the modeling and the math and so on I want to give you a feel of how we can understand how it is possible for a code to evolve okay so we're going to do a thought experiment and we're going to do the thought experiment by involving in our little story here the experts on codes who are the experts on codes spies you're right these characters from from from bad and possibly sexist 1960s TV shows all right so we're going to do an experiment that involves uh these spies and we're going to imagine that the spies of course have their secret code book so there's their code book and the spies are trying to communicate with uh one disreputable member of their Community shown here on the right and so we're going to do a thought experiment about what can happen when one spy tries to talk to to the other so let's start off with a with a message which is emitted over here so this is the message that she wants to send that is a received by by uh the the person on the right uses their code block and they correctly decode it as as uh as that sequence of uh of amino acids so so far everything is good there's only a single message that you can deduce from this signal that you receive okay so this is the standard operating procedure but the person on the right was chosen not just for their for their glamorous sartorial style but for the fact that they're very uh um incompetent and so I want you to imagine that this person has lost half the code book and so the code has now been uh changed because you've missed half the code book and so now he translates it as equals m c squared which means nothing to him but it may mean something to to you and so what we've learned from this is that if you evolve or change the code in this case by losing half the code book the message gets garbled so so far Crick was right suppose however that we have a statistical code book not a code book that gives you one message but a code book that gives you an ensemble of messages and from those messages you look at them and you say oh that makes no sense that makes no sense that makes it says oh phenylalum okay great perfect this must be what they what they meant if you have a code plus it's context then if you if you just have a probabilistic code book you have a chance of being able to interpret the message so the idea then was that if you have a polar ballistic code book then that means that you may you may need to have statistical proteins a process of translation that doesn't Just Produce one protein but produces many and this would make complete sense because think about early life think about early life which we know was a was a dominated by endosymbiosis and all sorts of events like that which of course led to many of the structures that we see in in modern cells uh like mitochondria and chloroplasts and so on so we can imagine that early life was a bit like early automobiles okay remember how early automobiles were they a hundred years ago a bit more than that automobiles did not look like they do today they were rickety old things they were sort of held together by string ceiling wax and if I drove over to one of my friends in my car and uh and then the wheel fell off you know she would just say well no problem I've got an old bicycle in the garage here we'll just screw on the wheel of that old bicycle onto your car and you'll go you're good to go that you could do you could mix and match parts 100 years ago 120 years ago in the early class try to try doing that today to a to a Toyota Corolla right to taking a bicycle wheel and sticking it on when you've got a flat tire that's not going to work at all modern cars are more highly evolved and so they're very intolerant of anything that is not exactly right and so we get the idea that evolved systems become very intolerant of any kind of ambiguity in what's present but systems that are very early on are very simple are able to tolerate ambiguity and uh and and and so uh you can have this idea that the codes are floppy that the statistical proteins that have been made are not always the same proteins and then somehow the messages uh can can be interpreted so in other words what I'm saying is that the code book and the message can co evolve as the organisms become more and more complex you get a probability distribution of codes that can be the outcome of translation and as the organisms become more and more complex that distribution gets narrower and narrower and very intolerant of any kind of element now you might ask yourself well wait this doesn't make any sense selection pressure acts on the phenotype it doesn't act on the code but I want to show you that it acts on the code too okay so here is a thought experiment but for me it was an actual experiment so I'm a physicist so I like to write papers with mathematical equations and so when I write a paper or a grant proposal I write it in a Thing Called Tech a type setting program that enables you to write equations my biological colleagues of course use a Microsoft Word which is fine and and so I guess the age of satire is not over yet and so uh so you can imagine the situation where I have sitting with my friends and the institute for genomic biology and I'm saying hey let's write this proposal together and they say sure about so we're going to write it in in word and hasten the my stuff in Tech and of course you know it's it's a complete disaster and uh and uh and what happens is the uh our proposal never actually gets written it never gets submitted and so it never gets funded meanwhile down the corridor another person is collaborating with their co workers they just write it in word no problems and even if their proposal was less good than ours it's still uh it still has a chance of being funded so the code actually uh does matter now what is the basic way that the genetic code evolves in terms of its context so here's our here's a um an interesting uh factoid and this this slide is now quite old but uh this is uh this you may not recognize this person this is Bill Gates uh this is the late uh Steve Jobs both of them with examples of their of their of their companies or computers and uh actually uh my computer is a Windows computer but many people like her like the Apple computers and and the reason that um you know the the reason I use a Windows computer well I mean everybody does right like 96 of all the world's computers run their windows in a very small fashion run uh the the Mac operating system and the reason is that the Windows operating system is much better than oh heck well that's a very inopportune time to have a blue screen of death there's operating system is to put it mildly uh rubbish uh it has all sorts of things like this but the reason why it is so popular is not because it is the best computer system it's because any program that you want to run you can find it on Windows but you may not be able to find it on the Macos that may not be so true today but it was certainly true uh suddenly 10 10 years ago and so what you learn from this is that the community with access to the broadest range of Innovations has an evolutionary Advantage anything that you want to do you can find a gadget in that operating system that does it and so what's important for platforms for operating systems for processes that are fundamental to cells like the like translation is that is that you have the broadest reach so what we did in our in our mathematical model which I'm not going to go into in detail was we we are considered a simulation a digital life simulation just like the computer virus once that I showed you at the beginning of the call at the beginning of the uh of the of the talk the ones uh run by Niels Barry Charlie at The Institute for advanced study so we have an asexual population of evolving reproducing digital organisms like computer viruses the phenotype is a function of their proteins and the proteins are obtained by translating the genome with a code but with uh with errors the individual reproduction rate is a function of fitness and the messages change are faster than codes and so so forth and so everything that's in this system allows codes to evolve due to selection of the phenotype through the mechanism that I was showing you so now what we're doing is simulating a whole population of different organisms which have different codes another question is which code is the one that wins all right so let's imagine that we've done this experiment so I started with a bunch of organisms all of which have slightly different genetic codes and they all co evolve and they're trying to deal with the environment that they are they're in and we watch how they evolve in time now we did two experiments here well I'm going to show you this graph and I'm going to show another one similar to it in the next slide this on the vertical axis is the quality of the code it's how good the genetic code is of those organisms minimizing ever and this is time over here and here's what happens when you do this with regular vertical darwinian Evolution that you're used to and you can see that what happens is that is as I as I evolve the system the uh the um the codes get better smaller is better and then eventually it stops and it just stays constant in time and maybe if we waited like 100 times longer maybe there'd be some other change down here or something like this and you run it again and for this one you get something like this and you run it again you get something like this and if you ask I've got a whole distribution codes here um what would I have got at random when you can work that out and it would be something like this and so what I've learned is that without uh in this experiment with vertical Evolution only I evolve organisms that have codes that are indistinguishable from random codes and they're not unique and they're certainly not optimal but if I switch on horizontal Gene transfer then what happens is the codes follow this blue trajectory here and as you can see end up uh with uh with a very optimal code and one which is very far from what you would get at random and so once you've learned from this is that the process of horizontal Gene to transfer as an evolutionary process leads to optimality of the uh of the genetic code now if we look at uh at uh how many codes we have in our system now that's shown shown here and again the same thing is true that if you just use a vertical Evolution uh you have you don't get much uh selection of the genetic codes as we saw on the previous slide and but if you switch on horizontal Gene transfer you get a universal genetic code and so what we've learned from this is that the the the phase diagram of Life must have looked something like this so we're somewhere up here where in that blob over here early on the evolution was a network process shown schematically over here rapid Evolution and then over here we have the vertical Evolution which we saw was incredibly slow and that's the process that we are in today and the summary over here was a transition that uh that Carl was like to call the darwinian transition a claimed of a phase transition uh between a collective Network phase of life and a transition to a life where organismal identity and individuality becomes more important all right so so I I I I'm going to uh skip my section on Homer care housing so I'm just going to skip through that and uh and I wanted to tell you about some of the things there's a universal in biology so anyway the bottom line of this is that uh we made a mathematical model of the evolution of of of of of Kyle autocatalytic self replicators and we could show that uh you ultimately end up with with broken 100 are broken uh chirality not just you get sun right handed or sun left handed but 100 effect and that's the thing that we observe in biology and that's the thing that was difficult to explain and and we have made a theory for that okay so um let me just very quickly show you um some examples of universality in Modern Biology even today there are things that are Universal not just the evolutionary processes of say the genetic code which may have happened billions of years ago but other things too so one example of this is the universal statistics of gene expression so if I have a genetically identical cells they can exhibit different protein copy numbers that's something that we've known for about 20 years that's called stochastic gene expression the whole process of of expressing genes is a random process and so the protein copy numbers are not thermodynamically large and so what happens is you have large fluctuations in protein copy numbers in in cells and here are experimental data are showing you for a variety of different uh of different uh cells here I'm looking to go through the through the details showing you that there's a universal distribution for the protein copy number now which is all these data are collapsing onto one universal curve can be predicted this is very much like the universality I showed you in the magnetic system at the beginning of the talk um here's another one which is absolutely fantastic and is still not understood and that is universal metabolism so here's the experiment so what you do is you go into the lab and uh you get some paper and some mud and bits of egg and water and stuff like this and you throw in some microbes and then you make a bioreactor and the bioreactor is producing that same methane okay and so you get this thing running and the bioreactor is uh your measuring is producing a fixed rate of methane coming out if you're feeding the bioreactor and the rate of uh methane coming out is a constant so you say well that's great I wonder what's in my bioreactor what's in my chemostat so you go and do a Melody genomic survey and and what you find is that even though the methane that is coming out is constant when you look at the community structure that you see and here I'm showing you examples these are real data from from different uh from a reactor what do you find is that you know let's say day 900 you go and draw a pie chart showing you the different uh uh operational taxonomic units that are present in your system and you say now until I'm done and then you know your advisor says aha you're not done wait two years and do the experiment again so you've trigger your thumb for two years and do the experiment again and then what you find is a completely different uh set of organisms that are in the back in the bioreactor but they're still producing methane is exactly the rate that it was before hey this experiment was actually done by Anna Fernandez and uh and in 1999 and her advisor basically said this can't be true we can't publish this the the we can't publish these data but they publish it in any case and and this has been replicated many times since so what we've learned then is that the functional properties of a community are insensitive to taxonomic fluctuations here's a here's another example this is from uh Luca and and durbly uh and uh partly uh this is decoupling function and taxonomy in the global ocean microbiome and basically the same the same story but despite the constant metabolic function of the ocean microbiome there were large taxonomic fluctuations and we don't have any idea of why this is happening okay so these are examples of universal things that are going on right now and they need to be understood and they're telling us something about the collective properties of microbial communities now if the NASA astral Biology Institute was still still a thing in existence and I hadn't moved from Illinois to hear and so on one of the things that I would be thinking about doing is exploiting this for example suppose I want to know what are going to be the bio signatures of say life that lives under the uh the ice of encelados well it turns out that the metabolic output of microbial communities doesn't depend sensitively on what organisms are there so if I have some knowledge of the geochemistry I can then exploit this this uh this functional redundancy to be able to make predictions about what a metabolic biosignatures I might find okay so let's end with a discussing about whether or not a universality is is uh is or is not useful so here is an example of another uh scaling law and this is a scaling law in ecology here this was uh this scaling law uh has been known since the 1850s in England uh these are data taking taken from bird lovers actually not bird lovers these are plants never mind these are plants people in England like two things or actually three things they like plants they're like birds and they like beer or like stink any pie or they're like football or whatever you want but they like plants and they're like and they like birds and so there's a lot of data going back uh you know 150 years um and and here is showing you the number of species as a function of the area of the of the of the habitat and what you can see from these data is that the number of species uh scales like the area to the one quarter power so you might say here's a field count all the bugs in the field count all the plants in the field double the size of the field count how many they're in there then you might say okay remember species are going to double not true it goes like roughly like the area to the one quarter power not not the area itself so this is a very important law because we can use it to make extrapolations for example if we know how much deforestation happened today in the Amazon let's say when we can figure out how many species might have got uh affected by that so that says these universal laws are useful there's an argument that says they're not useful so here's an experiment that was actually done this is Battle at Colorado Island in Panama and this is a an island which is beloved by ecologists because it has lots of trees and plants and we know every single tree and every plant on that island it's heavily studded okay so you might ask yourself the following question on this island what is the number of species fraction of species with a given number of individuals okay how many species have 100 individuals how many species have a thousand individuals how many species have four individuals in salt okay so you can produce a species abundance curve and um and then you and you get data that looks like one of these curves here I don't even remember which one it is so that would be uh that would be a measurement and you could make a theory for that because you could say well we have to look at the soil we have to look at the weather we have to look at the interactions between the trees the canopy and so on and so forth and if we had a detailed model we could probably predict uh this this this curve but there's another way to think about it which is just to say well let's just close it's just a random process something has to be the most abundant organism okay so what I've read is that's it what its name is but then something else has to be the next most abundant and you can work out a theory that looks like the general statistics that you would expect for abundance just like the central limit theorem in in statistics and so in in a neutral Theory the species are functionally equivalent they're not different they don't occupy different uh geochemical or biological niches metabolic niches so you've got these two completely different theories and one of them gives the black curve one of them gives the green curve they both explain the data equally well so this is uh again not not helpful so the upside of universality is that you can make predictions based on the minimal model and that's a good thing like trying to predict the metabolic signature or putative life under the under the ice cap of encels the downside of universality is that statistically similar results can be obtained from microscopic models that are completely different in their assumptions and so if you have something Universal at a high level of description that means you can't understand the actual processes that went on that caused the thing in the first place okay I want to end by asking what do we miss if we don't understand Universal phenomena and I'm going to talk about an example uh that that may not be meaningful to to some of you or many of you even but it doesn't matter I want you to just understand the the point so this is about something in in superconductivity and uh and there's a couple of students here from my class on emerging states of matter so they'll be familiar with these examples so what is superconductivity it's the it's the fact that you can have a current flowing through a material and there is no electrical resistance and no heat that comes out so that's that's the that's the idea of superconductivity it's just superconductor if you have it you can make levitating trains and and transmit power over long distances and solve all the world's problems that was discovered in 1911 1903 1933 it was also discovered that superconductors don't just have a a current that lasts forever and also go round and round Forever by petrol motion they also expel magnetic fields okay don't ask why it doesn't matter 20 years later after that it was discovered that actually nope it's not true they don't expel magnetic fields well some do but some don't some allow magnetic fields to penetrate a superconductor but in a lattice of so called vortices or flux tubes in a way that is you know I'm not going to I'm not going to go into but that that can happen and then finally oops wrong thing then finally uh about 10 years or so after that something called the judicial effect was discovered the idea that I can have um a current uh flowing um which which will will be uh um oscillating with a frequency that is just determined by quantum mechanics and doesn't depend on the material or anything like that so you can use this to create a universal standard of voltage and and of time okay so this this is a complicated quantum mechanical effect and it took 50 years and and most of the people on on this who discovered these things ends up getting Nobel prizes these were very important things scientifically and technically and the question is why did it take so long to make these discoveries are physicists stupid well maybe but uh but the thing is this it's even worse because in my class I derive all of these things in in basically one lecture in a few lines of algebra for jumbo that's written down here okay so what was going wrong what was going wrong was that people were focusing on the wrong level of description and I want to explain to you what I mean by that okay so in world of superconductivity you have to make a superconductor so that's a problem in quantum chemistry and Material Science there's a theory that applies to at least the classic superconductors but not the ones that everybody's excited about for the last 30 years the high temperature superconductors so there's a theory of that which is which is very nice and so on and then lastly there's a theory which I which I've given by this name here is basically a theory that looks at the quantum mechanical symmetries of Superman actors now when we talk about biology we have another set of levels of description so so this level is quantum chemistry this is electrons moving around and this is looking at Symmetry and and wave functions all right here in biology we start off with the lowest level of description with atoms and molecules there's an intermediate level of description where we you know we talked about with translation we look at our DNA we look at how elastic it is and how proteins fold and things like this we look at a liquid liquid intracellular complexes and things like that in cell biology and then finally on the LA on the larger scale I talked about the Dynamics of how systems evolved the Dynamics of evolving systems like the genetic code so those are levels of description these levels of description answer different questions so in superconductivity well quantum chemistry of Material Science says how do you make a stuff what's the specific recipe of putting the atoms together in such a way that you make a particular superconductor this uh this uh this intermediate level of description tells you about what is the basic mechanism by which uh you know electrons form what's called a Cooper pair a composite bows on the inside a superconductor and then do something called Bose condensation so this is a sort of more detailed uh description that applies to um to many different superconductors and this level of description this symmetry wave function quantum mechanical Theory describes why the phenomenon of superconductivity exists at all how you can get all the phenomenon of superconductivity just from one very simple and mathematical description now in the in the world of biology atoms and molecules tells us something about how specific biopolymers interact and fold undergo template directed synthesis and so on and so forth if you want to understand those questions you have to deal with atoms and molecules there's no way around it if you want to understand um the you know the basic functional cellular processes you don't need to have such a detailed description you can just think about uh you know face separation inside cells and and sort of bending rigidity of cell membranes and DNA and so on and so forth and if you want to understand why the phenomenon of Life exists at all well that's surely a question that would be answered if we understood more about the Dynamics of evolving systems different levels of description apply to different levels of universality so if I look in in the quantum chemistry of material science that tells us something about very specific materials like Atrium barium and copper oxide or something like this if I want to look at this level of description it tells us something about what are called weak coupling superconductors and finally this level of description uh this symmetry wave function Theory tells us about all superconductors whether they're made in a material science lab or whether they occur in the in the heart of a of a neutron star in biology this level of description applies effort to uh very specific biopolymers you know those chemical structure of RNA or DNA or some particular protein the elasticity theory for DNA and so on and so forth tells you about the physics of subcellular components and the Dynamics of evolving systems would have would be applying to all life and just in the same way that a universal turing machine with a Von Neumann architecture applies to all things that we call computers now why do we need this Universal level this top level description of of of of stuff well if I have a superconductor and I want to understand uh this level of description not only does it tell me that superconductors exist but it also tells me everything that a superconductor can do it tells me the myosin effect the vortex lattice the josen effects it tells me how a superconductor responds to electromagnetic fields so if I don't have this I can't predict how a superconductor responds to an electromagnetic field and that's a big problem by regarding superconductors as collections of atoms we are missing the emergent laws that act at the system scale and govern the large scale response to electromagnetic fields just like when we were looking at our bioreactor it produces methane at a constant rate if we just focus on the on the on the uh on the bacteria that are in there we won't be able to understand that we need to understand how metabolism can be emergent in a community this problem we know how to solve it took us 50 years to do it and we had to rejigger the way we think about physics for living systems we know that this level of description would apply to all of life and what happens if we don't have it we can't predict the response of living systems to selective perturbations we can't tell what happens when you play antibiotics or herbicides or insecticides or chemotherapy to somebody with cancer okay and and we know what happens in the real world whenever we do these interventions and treat living systems as engineered systems what happens is they fight back they evolve the cancer tumor evolves and you and you and you and the chemotherapy stops being effective Roundup stops being effective against weeds antibiotics stop being effective against bacterial infections and so on and so forth by regarding biology as complicated physical systems we are missing the emerging laws that act on the system scale and govern the large scale response to control perturbations and we do not know how to solve that problem all right if you if you want to read about any of these things that I've been talking about there is a article I wrote uh called life is physics with uh with Carl wos and another one on the statistical mechanics of early life in Phil transa this one was called life is physics for the following reason when I used to go to astrobiology conferences on the first day somebody would get up and show some extremely complicated chemical pathway that they thought might have existed in the RNA world or the sugar world or lipid world or whatever will be was the fat all the time and they would say life is chemistry and I fundamentally disagree chemistry doesn't it doesn't matter it does matter you can't build a superconductor with our atoms and molecules but you have to understand the emergent physical laws as well the dynamical processes that go on and so that's why we talk about this as life as physics all right so did we learn new physics when we study biological biological systems uh yes we do we we realize that they actually do things that physical systems don't are they Universal phenomena in biology yes genetic code gene expression distribution of species metabolism and so on do they reveal things that are important well yes they tell us about the phase diagram of life because about cell structure and principles of how things evolve and what do we miss by not understanding Universal phenomena we've we don't understand why life exists at all and we don't understand how to how biological systems respond to control perturbations so so here is uh here is the the history of life we know that some around here was a homoclimal transition in the genetic code the darwinian transition and finally 3.8 billion years ago last Universal common ancestor all of this happens super fast because it was dominated by Network effects and while and what I didn't tell you about this in detail or the catalysis leads to 100 homicorality horizontal Gene transfer networks Drive the evolution of the unique optimal genetic code and horizontal Gene transfer eventually becomes ineffective compared to Vertical selection and you get this transition to the vertical phase of life that we are in today I want to end with a quote a since I'm a physicist I study biology I'm not because I love biology I have a sort of hate relationship with Biology but but because it teaches me things that are that expands the scope of physics so ask not what physics can do for biology build you a better microscope build your build a computer simulation understand the uh the structure of some protein asking instead of what biology can do for physics it can teach us wonderful things thank you very much [Applause] all right so I'm very recently coming to appreciate this the importance of this horizontal Gene transfer but mechanistically I don't understand how like why this trade off is tied to optimizing the genetic code well you don't understand why what mechanistically I don't understand why it's massive Advantage is tied to having a sub optimal genetic code so the question is uh why why why is if I understand why why is horizontal Gene transfer um important in in evolving these genetic code is that what you're asking yeah yeah yeah so so the fundamental reason is this well I showed you in the in the simulations um was that if you if you just have vertical Evolution which I explained to you what it is um you kind of get trapped in local Minima okay so horizontal Gene transfer is a very non local shuffling of genes that wouldn't otherwise happen and so it's a much faster way of exploring the space of possibilities and so what happened in early life is organisms were very porous there's a lot of endosymbiosis so you know today we we only you know you and I are not horizontally transferring genes the bacteria in our guts are but in early life organisms would sort of Pulp go through each other and Collide and and subsume each other and so on and so there was a very natural built in mechanism for genes to be horizontally transferred and so when we when we model that in our in our simulations what we see is that is enormously effective in accelerating the evolution rate so so bottom line is horizontal Gene transfer is just one way to accelerate evolution and if you accelerate Evolution you don't get stuck in local Minima if you don't get stuck in local minimum as it were you'd then find the true dust code or the best whatever it is that you're optimizing and and that's why that's why it works so did I answer your question what was the bit what was the bit that I hadn't explained that made the penny drop I I saw it empirically that it was true but the mechanism oh okay so I explained it yeah go ahead thank you okay yeah hi there hi uh I'm Maddie from um MIT um great talk I was kind of interested based on your like um idea of evolution of this like Pro Geno like horizontal Gene transfer dominated system evolving to this darwinian phase where do you think kind of the universality of like essential Dogma kind of starts to evolve when we think of like the genetic code of like codons to proteins and DNA like is that something that might have existed with like this pre state or would this be something we only see with like the rise of like I don't think the central dogma even exists today okay we we know we know that that's we know that that's not true we know that there are there are ways that um that there can be you know post translational modifications you have a virtual transcription and so on and so forth so so organisms uh even today can rewrite their their genome and so um you know when when did the you know of course we we you know we the first people didn't you know didn't know about that Crick called it the central dogma as a joke um but today we know that you know viruses are doing this or all the time so we have lots of endogenous retro bio DNA in our own genomes so so I'm not so convinced that um that the um the central dogma world as it were ever existed or at least even exists uh even exists exists now but the extent to which you know genome editing self genome editing um evolved in time that's not something that I've looked at but you certainly could you could you could imagine it uh suddenly being accelerated during the progenya for example but it's going on today so so um so um and did I answer your question or did I just dismiss the premise of the question and so it swept it under the rug that way no it's very fascinating fascinating answer I would say biologists would have a lot to discussion I would say biologists have a lot to discuss with you about um the idea of the central dogma but I think that is a fascinating way to think about it yeah no no I mean I mean I mean you know it may be it may be broadly true but there's certainly lots of exceptions to it and and so uh and that's why I say it's not like it really has to happen it's it's just you know the balance of you know okay mostly these things work but the fact um they're not forbidden by any symmetry or any law laws of physics or anything like this so so how you know fundamentally I I think the the main principle of trying to underlie genome uh genome stability is essentially reproducibility in other words you know if everything is fluctuating too much then you're making too many possibilities and and then you you're getting um generalists as well but not new Specialists and so it's really tied up with you know whether the organisms are optimized for their particular environment and for the for you know for their niches in in the ecosystem so I think these these things are balanced like that thank you sure so I'm very excited to see you here because I'm also physicist by training and I have two questions for you so first of all can there be nuclear signatures for life and second question is we just can observe five percent of our universe the rest of the universe is dark energy dark matter can there be dark matter life um okay I so the question is are there nuclear signatures of life when you say nuclear what do you mean by that at the nuclear level like we talk about biosignatures of Life can there be signatures at the nuclear level do I don't understand what you mean sorry like uh can there be Nuclear Physics going on which can lead to life oh I I see I see um I don't know about nuclear certainly Atomic I mean there's um I don't really I don't know the answer to your question but but I'll give you an example there's um there is a particular excitation um in carbon the the oil excitation and and it's probably the the first or maybe only successful application of the anthropic principle uh where he guessed that there had to be such an excitation for some process to occur that was essential for life and indeed it was later discovered to be true so I don't really know the answer to your question it's not impossible because this whole example is is a sort of very strange one it's obviously something that if you take those sort of perspective that you should be looking at large scales of systems you would never think that there would be this kind of thing happening but we also know in physics that there was a scale interference and that small uh negligible effects kind of large consequences I have a whole other talk about about that in trying to understand um the the the tree like evolution of Life which I'm not going to talk about um so so I don't I don't really know um there was a second question a second question was we can only observe five percent of our universe because the rest of the universe is large right so can there be dark matter can there be dark matter and can you have can you have life yeah yeah why not is very very enthusiastically ready to get the back so I I think that the life is you know is essentially an inexorable consequence of the laws of physics I don't think it's Unique or an accident so yes that's my answer but I have no scientific reason for for answering your question in the affirmative yes please go ahead yes hello Professor like I just cannot express like how excited I am after your talk so thank you thank you so much actually I have the similar notion like uh I the like uh like whatever you have presented here like I'm I'm literally feeling we share the similar Vibe actually I'm the second year PhD student in astronomy and I have a degree in physics and so like I'm sorry I'm a little nervous but I have I have a lot to talk so uh so uh yeah I I want to ask like uh What uh since uh yeah like I also like the earth centric like investigation of life it it it really doesn't convince me to for like to to see the life outside the universe and so like I'm really interested to study the like uh physical Evolution like how how we can study the life like after the universe like and and it is true that uh we should have a generic uh like generic definition how should life look like so that's why I'm very much interested in the thermodynamic evolution of life so I just want to know like what are your thoughts about like what do you what do you think about like because there are many uh researchers who are doing uh great work on that the on the thermodynamic evolution of life so I just want to know your thoughts on that and I'm like I'm super excited to work on on this field and uh yeah like even uh I'm in second year and I like I have already decided I want my second PhD in my physics and I want to study the thermodynamic evolution of Life So yeah thank you thank you thank you very much for your kind words and um now I don't I don't quite understand what is the question that you're asking me though the microphone is next yeah so uh there is uh let the the the Third Law of like uh thermodynamics yeah the thermo uh yeah the entropy so it it says like um every natural uh laws in the world they have a particular direction and it find this is It's that's that's if if we think about that that's that's itself is a is a very great like itself is a very great it tells like every natural you know process in the world they have a specific Direction and what I feel like yeah what I what I feel like that's that's my hypothesis like that life is not the you know the the most like the the most probable state of state of the of the nature nature doesn't want right that's what I think and I want to study this uh with uh like thermodynamic evolution of life that's why uh yeah I want to study that so I wanted to know your uh okay so I think I think I I think I'm sorry I was so long I think I can paraphrase your your question so tell me if this is a reasonable paraphrasing of your question why why the why does life inexorably become more and more complex I I and I think that is a very important foundational question because you might say okay let's suppose you believed in the only World which I actually as it happens I I don't believe in it but but let's suppose you did then you might say well okay so I get these uh these uh these all the catalytic uh replicators I have RNA doing all the functions of of Life uh why isn't the world just you know knee deep in uh self replicating RNA molecules you know why do we have arts and elephants and and blue whales and things like this and so so I think the the you know the the fundamental question is why do you have this uh Evolution to greater and greater complexity and I think that's a um that's a question that we don't have a good answer for now I'll tell you what happens when we try to model living systems uh when we find a model living systems say in a computer you make an artificial ecosystem lots of things interacting with each other and you run it and what happens is it does evolve in complexity just a little bit and then it just stops evolving it just stay it stays constantly and it really the simulation does not involve more and more arbitrarily complex Life As Time proceeds so we try to figure out uh what is the fundamental mechanisms genetic mechanisms that could enable this increase to give you as you put it this directionality of life and what we discovered was this and it relates to things I emphasize in the talk mostly when we think about Evolution you know you read the newspapers you think about uh mutations and point mutations and things like this I don't think those things are very important at all for evolution on the large scale what we discovered in computer simulations was that there's two things that cause life to inexorably get more and more complex and that is first of all you have horizontal Gene transfer so you have mechanisms that enable um essentially an evolving system to really find its its local maximum or local minimum Optimum and the other is Gene duplication Gene duplication is very powerful because you make a copy of a gene and then one copy goes off and Carries On doing what it was supposed to be doing the other one can evolve without deleterious effect on the organism and when you look in in The evolutionary history of of life and you look at uh genomes you see throughout this pervasive influence of horizontal Gene transversely in microbial organisms and um and and and Gene duplication and you see Gene duplication in all branches of life um so so I think what you have to try to understand is the the interplay between these different our processes at the genetic level then have consequences for the large scale complexity of organisms so we we built um well I think is the first um computer model of an evolving ecosystem which has continual growth of complexity due to those particular genetic operators and it's not a very realistic model and the model and the method of the the way we measured complexity was completely unrealistic and we measured it by the length of the genome as opposed to something like common golf complexity or some other algorithmic complexity measure but um but it it does show you that certain genetic processes can give rise when they interact with the environment and that was important in our in our calculation I can give rise to this direction of life this ever increasing growth of complexity so that's the best I can do in answering your question is that helpful okay unfortunately run out of time for questions hopefully you can find Nigel at the dinner but let's thank our speaker one more time [Applause] [Music] I want
