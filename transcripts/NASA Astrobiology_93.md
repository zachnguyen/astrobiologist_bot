what do you think in the last century is like the big milestone for astrobiology in general it's the discovery of exoplanets like that changed everything every star in the sky hosts a family of Worlds and that one in five you go out and you count up five stars one of them has a planet orbiting the star in the Goldilocks or habitable zone and now suddenly like you had an exponential increase in the possibilities uh and then you add on to that the development of atmospheric characterization techniques where we can actually tell what the atmospheres of these exoplanets are made of which is mindblowing that's it like that's you know the the game has changed now we can look directly into the atmospheres of exoplanets and tell whether there's chemicals there that could only be put there by life or even technology centuries from now people will look back at that moment and be like oh that's when suddenly the field matured
