hello [Music] um my name is Missy Houston um I'm sort of a fifth year grad student at Penn State in astronomy as you may have guessed from my background um but I just successfully defended my thesis last week so I've gone ahead and assumed I don't get my diploma and start my postdoc until August but I'm still going to call myself Dr Houston now um so I'm going to be talking about something that was not in my thesis so I hadn't thought about too much for a couple months but I'm getting back to it now um this is some work I'm doing as part of the Penn State extraterrestrial Intelligence Center and this work is actually being led by a Dr Sophia shake at the study Institute so um this project came out of a group a collaboration called characterizing atmospheric techno signatures or cats which I'm very glad we found a good abbreviation for and um so what this group is doing is just kind of creating a library of possible techno signatures and especially focusing on atmospheric techno signatures as jwst launches and we're making a lot of advances in our ability to characterize exoplanet atmospheres um but this project we're talking about today actually goes a bit more broad than that and we're thinking of all the Techno signatures that we produce here on Earth so the project we're calling Earth detecting Earth is establishing benchmarks for detectability based on how strong our techno signatures we produce here on Earth are and how far away um we you would be able to use our telescopes to successfully detect our techno signatures so this is a very preliminary version of our plot here we're going to have more techno signatures than this and we still have to finish up a few calculations to get all our distances right but um we're basically just trying to calculate the detectable distance for our telescopes to observe our techno signatures for all of the Techno signatures that we could think of that humans produce so um this is related to a similar concept called the ignoscale which was proposed by socasinovaro at all a couple years ago this term is defined as the relative size or intensity of a techno signature in units of the same type no signature as produced by Earth's technology so kind of the first step in our project is to quantify the strength of Earth's current day techno signatures and this is kind of defining the power level that is an ignoscale value of one and then we're going to determine what distance we can use our technology to detect those technical signatures and to keep things kind of uniform among all detective signatures we're looking at we're adopting a signal noise ratio of five um but we're also going to talk a bit about scaling relations you can use if you want to get higher signal to noise or something like that so I'm just kind of going to go through a few of our calculations here um um I don't know why it's covering my weight over so uh the first kind of technical signature I want to talk about is intermittent celestially targeted radio Transmissions so the types of signals that would produce this are Medi signals so intentional messages that we have sent out ostensibly to communicate with extraterrestrial life but we don't really do a lot of that so um the more common types of signals we send out are powerful radio signals targeted at planets and asteroids in the solar system in order to characterize them with radar so for our calculation we are assuming that our radar transmitter is Arecibo Rip but um our Observer for radio observations we are using the currently under construction square kilometer array if we assume assume an observation time of one hour then we get our Earth detecting Earth detectable distance of 12 000 light years for our most powerful radio signals so this is the highest number that we're going to see in terms of our distances here but I wanted to start with it to really emphasize that um I see techno signatures as a really important part of the search for biosignatures because when you think about all of the signs of life that we produce here on Earth our radio signals are by far the most detectable thing that we produce so I really hope that the fields of biosignatures intactive signatures can work closely together because I think we want to take as many approaches as possible to find any types of life we can in the universe so the next category of techno signature is just another type of radio signal intermittent celestially untargeted leakage so these are signals that we intentionally send into the sky but not necessarily with the aim of going to space so things like Military and Commercial aircraft radar we're just kind of assuming the standard aircraft radar systems for a transmitter and again observing with the square kilometer array and our Earth attacking earth distance is a bit over 200 light years um so this is a still a pretty big distance this includes quite a number of stars um if we're considering you know the Stars within this distance range uh the next Technic signature I want to talk about is persistent omnidirectional radio leakage so there was some early work done on this topic actually in 1989 where um Sullivan at all simulated um the output of Earth's television Tower Transmissions as you might be able to observe them from space and concluded that it's possible that other life out in the universe knows that we're here um our TV signals aren't quite as powerful now as they were in the peak a time but um we've got all kinds of mobile cell phone towers all over the world now so there's a really great paper that just came out a few weeks ago by Mira Sade at all um that kind of does a similar calculation to the Sullivan paper but using mobile phone towers instead of television so we adopted their value of a transmitter strength of four gigawatts and again using the square kilometer array as our radio detector and we got a detectable distance of just under a light year so this is a little bit too short of a distance to reach any nearby stars um but it's getting pretty close and as radio technology improves this kind of uh thing is going to become more feasible the next techno signature I want to talk about is intermittent targeted laser leakage so these are laser signals that we happen to be sending out into space um so for the non astronomers in the room um the example that I want to use here is Adaptive Optics lasers Adaptive Optics is an astronomy technique where you take ground based telescopes and distort their mirrors and in order to account for the effects of the atmosphere on the light that we observed from space um and uh there are kind of a lot of factors that goes into that but one thing is that sometimes we need to create an artificial guide star to calibrate these and so what we do is send really powerful lasers shooting into the atmosphere so that's some amount of that laser power hits the atmosphere and bounces back for us to observe while a lot of that laser power just happens to go out into space wherever it's headed so um for our calculation for laser leakage we use the Keck 10 meter telescope and it's of Adaptive Optics system and we get a detectable distance of about 10 light years so this distance does include a few nearby stars but it's important to note that we're not actually directing these lasers at any nearby stars because you only need to use Adaptive Optics um the laser artificial guide star if you don't have a real well known bright star you can look at so we're never really doing that right at nearby Stars which would be pretty bright so the next category of techno signatures I want to get into are exoplanetary techno signatures that you might detect for example in our in the atmosphere of a planet so we've got an example here of one possible atmospheric pollutant which is nitrogen dioxide and this is based on work done by kaparapu at all a couple years ago so this simulation was performed using the planetary Spectrum generator and assuming that our Observer is a luvex which I guess is now called habitable worlds Observatory um which is a space mission that's under development but is the combination of luvar and habex Mission Concepts that was for a few months called lubrics but now this is already out of date so um our detectable distance here is a little over three light years so this includes some nearby stars um but it's important to know that NO2 can also be created through natural means so there's a lot of complicated chemistry at play here to determine whether it's actually artificial but a really important thing about these um cultural app atmospheric pollution signatures is that you can use the same observations to search for techno signatures and biosignatures when you're looking at the Spectra so I think it's a really great way that these two techniques can work together um and then the last techno signature I'm going to talk about is City Lights so I'm showing a picture here of Earth as each part of the world appears at night with City Lights um so for this calculation we're using some work done by Thomas Beatty where he assumes that our lights are primarily from high pressure sodium lamps in this simulation our Observer is luvore a so a slightly earlier version of the lyrics I talked about last time luvore was an earlier Mission concept concept for that so this exact design is not going to be launched in space but we're going to have something similar and our distance for this one is only 0.075 light years so this means um that we could only use something like luvor to detect our city lights if we're in the Oort cloud which is just kind of the outer regions of the solar system um so if you want to detect this kind of thing you're going to have to uh have a planet that has a lot more lights than we do and so I'll just kind of leave up my summary slide here as the list of the Techno signatures that we're looking at um the first few on the list here are the ones that we quickly went over I've got a few more highlighted in yellow and for those our calculations are still underway and then we've crossed a few out um that turned out to be techno signatures we've crossed off of um consideration for various reasons mostly because it's just not feasible to observe them from space at all we'd be talking about still in Earth's atmosphere for our distance or because um another possible techno signature is observing the contents of Earth's atmosphere over time and how it changes but we decided for this project that we're not going to get into things that are based on changes over time because uh this is already a really big paper as is um so yeah I can take questions I also have my email and Twitter up there all right thank you Macy our new doctor Houston um unfortunately we only have time for one question so I want to see some real enthusiasm I really hi um thank you so much for your talk I definitely agree with you that take my signature and by signature scientists need to work more closely together um I was wondering I know the paper is already super cool as it is but as a sort of follow up um would it be possible to estimate what sort of techno signal like how those techno signatures would evolve um in the future and if there's one that's going to shoot up and at what point in our future uh would we be detectable to most terrestrial planets in our galaxy yeah we'll talk a little bit about that in the discussion but we're not going to get too quantitative um but that is something that comes up as in you know uh one of the main things you hear people talk about this in is is like radio leakage because like if our cell phone towers were more directed you know down at the Earth they could be more efficient and maybe more advanced technology has less leakage into space just because it's a waste of energy um so yeah these are things we think about I don't have any definitive answers right now thanks [Music] [Applause] [Music] um
