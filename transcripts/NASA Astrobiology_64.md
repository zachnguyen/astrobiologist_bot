a [Music] [Applause] [Music] greetings friends fellow earthlings and explorers of the Briny deep and welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life I'm your host Dr Graham Lao aka the cosmobiology and we're brought to you by the NASA astrobiology program and seanet or now before we start our show today as always a huge shout out to everyone out there one who's watching our show live to those who watch our recorded episodes later and to those of you who share about our guests on our show who talk with our guests on our Show online and who share on social media about the upcoming episodes we have we really appreciate all that you do a huge shout out this month to Antonio Molina at athnos on Twitter SLX uh who shared about our show in espanol uh for those who are once a while watch today and find out more about this incredible episode which honestly today's episode is going to be an absolute Banger of a show with the help of the Schmidt ocean Institute or so SOI we're about to embark on our first ship to shore episode of the show now sadly for me I'm I'm the shore part of it but we have our guests are joining us from the ship from the research vessel falor 2 which is currently exploring the depths of the atakama trench off the coast of Chile leading the science of this Mission are my personal friends and colleagues from the Blue Marble space Institute of science drors Armando asusto and laurren Syer Dr Asos is also a researcher in the planetary and habitability department at the Centro deia in Spain he's an expert on zeraph files organisms that thrive in dry places and he's also spent a good deal of his research career exploring the okama desert on land Dr Lauren Syer is an assistant professor at Stockton University she's an expert in the world of microbial activity metabolisms and unique environments and biogeochemical cycling um they're also just you know two of my favorite people on the planet so I am so excited to now welcome them to our show live from the falor 2 Armando Lauren thank you so much for joining us hello hello Graham thank you for having us I mean it's super exciting this is our first time doing a ship to shore episode and so we might have a little bit of audio issues and video issues but that's okay because this is is incredible to see both of you out there right now it looks like a beautiful day out there in the Pacific right now it's gorgeous it's nice and sunny the the weather's been beautiful and it is the calmest day at Sea I think I've ever had as an oceanographer I love it um now I'll start off um Armando this mission that the the two of you are on and leading with with many of your colleagues is about looking for living fossils of the ocama trench can you explain this idea this concept of living fossils for our audience well actually this is started like a decade ago in which I collected a number of evidences of microorganism that have been finding in the coastal range of the takama desert some of them that look to be very ancient so that led me to the hypothesis to say well what else is really ancient in general terms for all life forms that have been found inaria to my surprise a number of what we call living fossil that is species that were known before in the fossil records that just by chance someone discovered them later like this famous Santos right but in these cases in this case a number of I call them sings with Tails like bibes like bapod and other um ancient organism like choid in which we know that are still arounds here and there in the planet but in this case it called my attention that were so many finding just by chance with people typically fer man or other people doing some other kind of research find them then just in front of it that internal when I also reported that the all the M Life that colonized as you know is also well known Mars analog model when trying to understand the phenomena how life colonize this really dry environment and I knew that whatever was Finding Inland at some point must have come from the sea so that brought me to the question well what is going on there on the sea that would tell me that if theama not only only the driest Des but also the oldest being 150 million years old because the whole house American play has been more or less in the same latitude then it followed that the submerged part of the plate that goes into the ocean could be as old as well so if people were finding this amazing P hey we have seen this in the fil reg how how come we are seeing it here crawling in the SE bottom maybe there were just those representative that but just by chance was people finding for entire ecosystem that should be that all so I present I started getting people expert in everything that I do I did not have experience like orography marine biology etc etc etc in order to bring in this amazing team of scientist each one expert Char from geology to physics etc etc in order to bring them down let's see actually this is true we may find entirely e an ecosystem so for us it's a it's like a trip to the Past right 150 million years how would the bottom of the ocean would look like and that's what it brought us here that's fantastic I'm so glad you mentioned bringing together a diverse team with different backgrounds you know in astrobiology especially through the NASA astrobiology program and the missions that we we fund to go out and explore in the cosmos and here on Earth it does require a lot of different disciplines and so I guess maybe a fun question for both of you is is what is your experience is this your first time second time hundredth time out at Sea this is my third time at Sea although it's my first time co leading a cruise um but my first two cruises were in the Atlantic and the North Atlantic and we were primarily looking at activity in the water column so this is my first time in the Pacific and my first time doing ROV operations so I'm super excited to be involved in this project and in my case is even even more incl because this is my first time ever on any type of boat except one time I rod in a little in middle of Madrid that was it so for me it was an entire new pers from A to [Music] Z wow it is Armando it is a huge step from a rowboat up to this incredible research Your Vessel you're on right now with the fal Core 2 um for our audience who are watching right now and for those watching the video later um we are going to have a live tour of the ship here in just a moment um after I asked Lauren and Armando some more questions about the incredible science that they're doing on this Mission as well and so uh Lauren for you I love this concept of looking for metabolisms in the dark as you've called them on this research Mission obviously you know a lot of our audience should know that a lot of the primary prot AC it on Earth comes from sunlight and you know from from photosynthesis but now you're looking at things on the seafloor where it's extremely dark a different pressure an alien environment really what kinds of things are you specifically looking for on the seafloor well the thing that really interests me about the seafloor is like you said it is a dark environment it's cold it's under a lot of pressure it couldn't be more different than uh the surface of the Earth and and Life As We tend to think about it and what really fascinates me about this environment is that because there uh is no sunlight um there's really two main sources of food and energy for the organisms that live here one is primary productivity from the surface ocean um so most of the productivity in the ocean occurs in this top uh 200 meters of the ocean where light can penetrate and phytoplank in or doing photosynthesis and producing all this organic carbon and all of that productivity eventually rains down to the bottom as something called Marine snow and we have seen a ton of that here because this is an incredibly productive area this is a huge upwelling Zone meaning that uh water from the bottom of the ocean which is very cold and nutrient rich is seasonally carried up to the surface and fuels all of this primary productivity producing all of this organic carbon which eventually rains down to the bottom as these clumps of fluffy material that literally look like a snowfall and so that's one major source of energy and food for organisms on the bottom of the ocean the other one and the one that fascinates me the most is chemical energy and that's the one that's the most astrobiological relevant because if we find life on other worlds in our solar system chances are it will be fueled by the energy of chemistry geochemistry so the reaction of water and rock uh fueling hydrothermal activity uh fueling things like uh methane seeps and so uh chemical energy fueling life is just so so fascinating to me because it's so alien from what we usually think of when we think of the food web right we think about sunlight um providing energy to plants so they can produce food and then animals eating those plants and other animals eating those animals but at the bottom of the ocean there are entire ecosystems that are supported by the energy of chemistry which is just incredibly fasc ating and if we find life on other worlds we may find ecosystems just like those oh it's incredible um it's the culmination of months of work and hours of work on the ship but months of work of preparation uh so a methane seep for uh Folks at home is uh an area where just like here we have a subduction zone where you have one tectonic plate sliding underneath of another one and it causes the plate on top to buckle and form all of these ridges and what in geology are called anticlines plac is where the The Rock has been folded upwards and underneath of these folds methane gas gets trapped and eventually seeps up to the surface and this is one really important source of chemical energy to the sea floor um methane seeps can also form as a result of decomposition so we were also prepared to find areas where methane generated by the decomposition of all this organic material raining from above uh could also create one of these methane seeps but we were really really interested in finding the kind that are geologically formed and so um we were spending every night mapping the sea floor Gathering Beth themetry data from the ship's incredible sonar system looking at back scatter which shows how much of that sonar penetrates into the seaf Flor and how much of it bounces back off of rocky surfaces towards the ship and trying to find places where we might find a methane seep um we were looking for bubbles in the sonar data as well but uh bubbles from methane seeps are generally a lot easier easier to find in shallower waters than this so just because we didn't see bubbles um we still thought well you know they could still be down there maybe they're not uh bubbling very actively maybe they're too deep for us to see but we found these places that looked really really likely and just went down with the ROV and spent hours crawling along the seafloor looking for signs of seeps and when we finally found one it was an incredibly exciting moment that's so fantastic now um for both of you so so this is ocean world's month uh through NASA it's a time to to explore not just our Ocean World the Earth but also the many other ocean worlds of our own solar system places where oceans have been detected could possibly be places like Europa and Enceladus potentially Titan Triton maybe even Pluto who knows there's a bunch of possibilities for underground oceans and some of these other worlds out there I wonder for both of you if you could speak to the importance of the research you're doing right now not only in understanding life and other ocean trenches around the Earth but but also what is your vision for how this impacts future research on other ocean worlds as well well that that actually is very interesting question because it's so highly related just said um you think about the icy moons like in cadus Europa or others that we are discovering in which we see we have the six layer of ice ice water and I it sounds redundant to say ice water but at those temperature you can have ice many other things as well you have the sick layer of ice covering where we see there is internal oans there and at least in the case I think is Europa it even has more water than our planet it has a lot of water so given that you already know that it has ice water then you have water there um that means that you have a source of energy that must be keeping that water liquid and then typically what know what what we know on Earth the typical sources that we keep that is the nuclei that is producing some kind of heat that interacts with the magma that interact with the water right then you have this back hydrothermal vents that produce a lot of water coming in contact with a number of minerals those minerals are able to be reduce or oxid different type ofm and then you have the primary producer and you have the whole Community can Ser from them so in the case of the in Europa for example they we know again we have the SI layer of ice they are quite far from the Sun so you have little s so you would expect that you have life and all that requires I mean water required by life in those system it may be the case that we know that we don't know nothing yet on the ecosystem that may be living in those Moon there and that's his that it has been a huge Discovery for science because you have I propose that maybe 20 years later you been called to crazy how come on you can find life in the icy moons of Saturn but now actually I see more as if we were to bet money on where we find life any type of live from probably micr as we know we don't say Mars we say europ we say Inus because we know now they we have liquid water which is the main ingredient for all life on Earth so who knows that's that's that's how we're looking at this in vitamin as well and we were just talking with a colleague last night when we're seeing the Rober sing swiming on the oan floor and seeing many Spees that the marine biology have been never seen before we have this huge it looks like a deep sea cumber is it looks like a huge trite yeah the big black one yeah the big black one black and when they saw it they just jump on their seat open their mouth and pointed to they look at each other what is that so it it would be more or less the same way we we in 20 30 years when we would send finally mission that we going to go through those and actually explore the oceans of in and trying to maybe the who knows an entire completely separate from Life deep sea ecosystem yeah so certainly exploring the bottom of the the sea Flor with an ROV is a lot like exploring the surface of another planet we know so little about the seaf Flor um I think we we know more about the surface of the Moon than we know about the bottom of our own ocean and and flying the ROV and and seeing all these incredible scenes for the first time it really did feel like exploring another planet is really beautiful yes truly truly and I love that so much um and you know so this Saturday as well is also World oceans day across the planet a time to celebrate our oceans um so kind of you know just a little bit beyond the research that you're doing right now um this amazing research vessel you're you're on um how do you see us doing a better job as humans um and being involved in understanding our oceans caring for our oceans supporting our oceans moving forward if there was like one message you would want to give people for World oceans day about the world's Global oceans what would you say um I would say that we rely more on our oceans than I think most of us realize the oceans of our planet are really the lungs of our planet they respire they breathe for us they produce oxygen and carbon dioxide and generate um energy and maintain the temperature of the planet the ocean has been absorbing much of the carbon dioxide that we've been producing as a result of industrialization and pretty soon the ocean is going to reach Tipping Point where it just can't buffer that uh production anymore um and it's already starting to affect life in the ocean through uh acidification um it's it's really incredible because there were moments when we were on the bottom with the ROV looking at places that no human being had ever seen before thousands of meters deep and we were finding trash and it was heartbreaking to see it actually because these incredible pristine environments where where there's so much diversity of life and it's so alien I mean imagine being a a creature on the bottom of the ocean and seeing this this huge robot come at you with all these lights on it I mean it must feel like an alien abduction right but there's still the signs of human life everywhere even in places that we've never touched um and I think that sometimes we don't realize the impact that we have on these incredible pristine places and they were here long before we were um and they'll be there after we're gone so um we've been given a responsibility to be the stewards of this planet and um to care for it as as our mother as as our home and and we only get one planet Earth um so if we mess this one up there's there's no other Earth for us out there so the ocean is such a huge part of that it covers most of the surface of the globe um it provides so many important uh processes that that make life on Earth possible um there would be no life on Earth without our oceans and so we have a great responsibility to care for them that's fantastic um I will say before we jump in so we're GNA do our our tour here fairly soon I have a few more of my own personal questions as the host I get to be a little selfish with things um one thing I do want to ask Armando you gave a TED Talk Back In in 2017 about your work on the Ocoma desert and your research in astrobiology it's garnered well over 1 million views online now over these last seven years um I wonder if you can speak to the importance of sharing your work through venues like Ted and other experiences like that to let others know what you're doing in astrobiology well for me it's so clear what's the point of making and generating new knowledge you don't share it openly at any time with everyone it's as simple as that what what the point of being a science scientist if you will you stay in your old little world of the lab and so no you have to CH it hey let me show you this fantastic SC I have been finding around for me is it's like the whole deal how you can again so those knowledge and just keep it to you for yourself come on everyone yeah it's the best part of being a scientist is getting to share it I love that so much yeah Carl San said when you're in love you want to share with the world right um and many of us love what we do in The Sciences um so I do want to share we we did a poll on YouTube for our audience before the show we we wondered like what people's favorite of the icy ocean worlds of our solar system beyond Earth might be we gave them some choices Enceladus Europa Titan maybe they could drop their own for Pluto or something else um over 43% of the respondents said Europa is their favorite um now that said one of our respondents left a comment to at scientist orish who is ishan Madden um who is a graduate student who's reached out to me in the past to talk about astrobiology um really wanted to push Titan as being the a really likely place to explore for like a nitrogen dominated atmosphere with uh stable surface liquids comp on complex organic chemistry at the surface but it's also very different it is a very cold world it doesn't have the same kind of chemistry um the fluid on the surface there is not water the fluid is is methane and ethane and other hydrocarbons which presents a very cool environment which then kind of brings me Lauren and your research you've gone to a lot of really cool places to do research you've been to uh serpentinization systems in Oman you've been at Sea uh you've done some work studying these iron rich bogs in New Jersey um I wonder if you can speak a bit to how exploring these diverse environments really plays into your own understanding of life on Earth and our search for life out there I think what I really enjoy the most about being a microbial ecologist and a biogeochemist is that it's constantly expanding my concept of what life is and what it can do um I think that we have yet to find the limit of what life really is we have yet to really truly Define it and every time we think we have a handle on the limits of life we find something that's even more extreme and um it's just fascinating to me and it's the thing that I I find the most fun to share with my students that there are places where microbes can exist in boiling acid and these alkaline environments that are incredibly CTIC um at extreme pressures and uh freezing temperatures um I mean they're just it just fascinates me that um life to to to uh borrow a cliche life finds a way right yeah and um yeah I think that's the most fun about my job is that I get to go to all of these incredible places and examine what life is capable of doing in all of these incredible environments that are so alien really to to our understanding as human beings of what what is comfortable what is tolerable what what is habitable um and that only expands uh our understanding of where we might find life elsewhere fantastic now this is kind of more for for both of you you know uh those of us who maybe grew up watching Star Trek have always thought of space as the final frontier but Lauren as you mentioned yourself you know we've only explored the seafloor of our own planet to a small degree I think roughly 20% of the bottom of the ocean has been mapped in high resolution if I'm correct um but we still haven't really even explored much of the open ocean of our own planet and so with a research vessel like falor 2 which is remarkable um and we're going to have a tour here very soon and the ROV I should say ROV means remotely operated vehicle for those watching and haven't heard that term before uh for the ROV Sebastian um you know we have these like these larger parts of our exploration of the ocean but I wonder if you can help me tie this into space exploration a little bit when you're out like you you are so separated right now even though we're connecting over the Internet because of how technology has progressed you are still very far from the rest of civilization and Humanity very much like Travelers going out into the cosmos to explore space and then you're also using a robot to explore a very alien environment does it feel like you're kind of also exploring space in a certain way while you're out there oh absolutely yeah I I mean uh anytime you're at Sea you really are kind of in your own little microcosm your own floating world in the middle of nowhere and if you forgot something that you needed to do your science um well there there's no running out to the store and getting it um all of your needs are met right here we're all living in this kind of mini laboratory SL Hotel um in the middle of the ocean although as as uh research vessels go you can't get any more comfortable or high tech than falor 2 it is just an incredible vessel and this has been probably my most um relaxed uh time at Sea in terms of just like having the Comforts of home but it really is still like being on a on a spaceship in a lot of ways you know you're you're isolated with a small group of people we work every day often Around the Clock we keep watches um we have to time uh all of our work when we measure the water when we put the ROV in the water when it comes back up on Deck everything has to be very organized and um everything has to be very planned out to the hour um and so it's in many ways a lot different than being out in the field when you're on land um because you really are kind of in this uh this remote microcapsule a scientific laboratory out in this vast expanse and uh it's it's truly incredible I mean Armando this is your first time on a research ship so uh you could speak to this I guess the best because you this is your first time experiencing it yeah and actually let's not forget that we have a a room that is called Mission Control yes we do like watching a Rob Mars but this case I actually was thinking about that because I was just watching how the r was going down to the water there and was thinking was seeing the water there amaz this little piece of machiner is going to go down for example tomorrow 4.5 kilometers down uh and he sending like a pro watching from afar the same thing when you were talking with astr with the moon so yes this is quite amazing experience quite different for what just said that's fantastic so I'm gonna do something a little bit different we don't ever do this during ask an astrobiologist but you know it's a shi toore episode this is our first first of a Kind for us um in the YouTube chat right now uh Keith has dropped in and said Eleanor says hi Mommy um so I wonder if since both of you are so far from your families I I wonder if if either of you want to just share something for your friends and families back home oh hi Elanor hi Josephine oh hi Keith I think the hardest part about being at Sea always for me has been uh being away from home and this is the first time I've been to Sea since I became a mom and this is the longest that I've been away from my kids since they were born so of all of the hardships of being at Sea and um all of the hard work that we've been putting into and the struggles that we faced throughout this entire experience I think the hardest part has been being away from my babies I I love you both so much and Keith you are the most amazing husband in the world for supporting me as I explore the world and do all this incredible science and you keep everything at home running smoothly and you take care of our kids and uh I could not have hoped for a more supportive partner than you and I I love you all so so much wonderful I will say Armando real quick um so Rodrigo Rodrigo azua has has has chatted as well and wanted to say please say hello to Armando from his family uh they've been following the streamings with excitement they're they're excited for you and the crew thank you very much I say in for them oh that's wonderful thank you so much for both of you for sharing that um and thank you to the amilies for tuning in and joining us here as well for asking astrobiologist in our episode we are going to make our segue now into the tour of the ship um just before we do that I want to give an acknowledgement real quick one to Schmid ocean Institute um who own and operate um the the re the the research vessel we on the falor 2 and the Sebastian ROV a huge shout out to Hannah Nolan and Sophia pestova who are helping us in the background right now they're behind the camera so our audience isn't seeing them right now but there there hand waves there we go thank you um so much for helping us out um for our audience who are watching uh you can ask your general questions about the science and the research life at Sea and all those things for Armando and Lauren and we will do our best to get to those questions I'm going to Pepper our questions throughout the tour here as well as towards the end uh we'll have some some q&as for for both of our researchers as well but we're going to do a tour and so as we go into each room of the ship here and we kind of do our little tour around these different areas if you have specific questions about the ROV the hangar mission control the Laboratories any of that kind of stuff the bridge that we're going to see the research vessel itself put uh feel free to ask us and I will do my best to get those questions over to our researchers and we might even meet some other people along the way so um for our team on the ship I think we're ready to go for our tour here then all right let's go okay let's go so this is the AF deck uh it's about the size of a basketball court it is huge there's Hanah so you can see the crane that we have here uh that we can use to lift equipment onto the ship it is massive as you can see um and back here we can uh store equipment we have Vans here for mobile laboratory space um and we have a a an arm on the back that we can use to lower equipment into the ocean um we're not using much of that right now on this uh on this Expedition we're mostly using the ctd and the ROV which are kept in the hanger uh behind me so let's go take a look at that space oh that is so cool um and I should say for for our audience you know some of our our members of asken astrobiology our producer and director Mike toon uh and Sarah Treadwell who is in the chat right now have also been on Research vessels in the past um which they've both told me that this is a much higher state of the art research vessel the falcore 2 oh this ship is absolutely yeah I mean I been to se twice before this and the falor 2 is just an amazing vessel I mean it is huge it is so technologically advanced in terms of its capabilities um just anything you could possibly need and in addition to that so SOI has an incredible science team on board that that work with the scientists on every uh cruise that are just so knowledgeable so helpful so accommodating I mean they have just anything that we have needed they have done their absolute best to make it possible so not only do we have this incredible ship at our disposal with all of its um capabilities which we're so excited to show you but we also have this team of very very experienced people who have just done everything in their power to make this Cruise a success and so it's just been an experience unlike any other that I've ever had it see even the people that have many Expedition like this one when they first got into the they were well M just look at all the Fantastic SC we have around yeah it is massive it's beautiful yeah yeah even just as a as a as a place to live and work it's just I am yeah it's very clear that the the folks at SOI when they were uh M building this new ship they really took into account that not only are we working here every day but we also have to live here every day and so they've provided so many comfortable spaces for us places to relax places to uh sit together and watch movies uh uh the food has been absolutely incredible I must say um so this has just been all around A great experience totally First Rate um so we're in the hanger right now um over here is where the ROV Sebastian lives uh and he's in the water right now so you can see the winch and the cable that uh connects him to the ship um but when he's on deck this is where he hangs out um and in a moment yeah it's such a huge uh space I mean it's just awesome that we have this place that uh you know the ROV can be whenever he comes back up on Deck we can get all of our samples off and uh every time he comes back on Deck there's so much that needs to be done to uh turn around the roob and prepare it for the next dive and so we have lots of room to to work around him and and uh get what we need over here we have the ctd rosette or the ctd carousel um so this is a ring of nisin bottles for capturing seawat from different depths it also has a variety of sensors on it that tell us about the temperature the depth the pressure the conductivity uh the salinity and oxygen of the water that we can measure uh in real time as the ctd descends and then as it rises back up in the water column we can capture water from uh The Depths that we choose and Sample it um so this is a really important tool in oceanography that we've been using to study the seawat and over here is so real quick um Lauren real quick for our audience um just to describe so ctd is um for could you could you describe what that means for our for our audience conductivity temperature and DEP yeah it's a it's a tool that oceanographers have used for a long time right yeah so you'll find one is on pretty much every ocean oceanographic Expedition not all of them will use it uh some are more ROV driven but we've been using both the ctd and the ROV on this Expedition so over here we have one of these monitors that are shows what uh subastian is doing right now on the seafloor uh these are all over the ship in the labs in our rooms in all of the spaces so that if at any time the ROV is on a dive we can see what the ROV is seeing in real time and if we see something exciting we can uh run down to Mission Control and say hey can you grab a sample of that for me or um even just watch what the ROV is doing and um enjoy this science from anywhere on the ship so we don't have to be in Mission Control to watch the ROV we can do it from anywhere uh using these monitors looks like right now they're picking up a a rock sample using the the scoop there's a little shrimp yeah that's so cool um so we are actually cutting over to the ROV feed directly in our show right now so that the audience is seeing the arm up close and what they're doing yeah I know we've had a joke already mentioned in in the YouTube chat about the falcore I and the Sebastian as names um I'll allow our audience to share in the chat if they want to about where those names come from we do have a question for our audience as well so Sebastian um is a very fun name and so for our audience we're going to drop a little poll in the chat just to ask everyone of you know you see this amazing robot but what would you name a robot for exploring the deep ocean if you had the opportunity to do so and maybe also ask where do they saying faler and sasan came from the huh yeah who got who gets the reference I know at least one person has made a joke about it so yeah so you can see on these monitors not only can we watch the ROV but we can also see uh the depth that the ROV is at uh the temperature of the water the salinity uh and the oxygen concentration as well um and the cameras on the ROV are all in 4k the the side cam is at least and so we can really see all of this in in like really great definition the resolution is great um the camera feed off of the sa uh the Sebastian is just awesome um we've already captured so many beautiful images of the seafloor um looks like like the geologists are super interested in this Rock right now it's got some really cool banding for sure and not forget that they are the one you are seeing here is being moved by a person that we just show you Mission Control person here mov with that arm that is taking place that 1.8 kilometers done pass here for me again it's amazing yeah there's actually two pilots that you'll meet uh when we go into Mission Control who control the ROV one flies the ROV while the other one controls the the arms um um and it it's all done through uh controls almost like a video game uh there's like a joystick that they use and they they can um manipulate the arm uh of the of the ROV from mission control and 2,000 meters down or more it it does everything that the pilots tell it to do and you can imagine how tricky it is as an ROV Pilot trying to manipulate this large robotic arm to pick up these often very delicate samples and uh place them on the ROV to bring them back up to the scientists um and sometimes we have to try multiple methods of sampling in order to uh successfully capture the sample that we want but uh this Sebastian's capabilities are just truly incredible um there's lots of space for uh different types of samples we can take samples of rocks samples of sediment uh we have bio boxes for taking uh animal specimens Rock boxes for taking rocks um there's more nisin bottles on the ROV so that we can take water samples on the bottom uh so we every time the the RV comes up he's just loaded with samples for all of our scientists to uh to analyze and explore that's fantastic I will say so our our audience is dropping lots of possible names right now and I absolutely love it I'll share all of those in a moment I want to give them a chance to add some more and for our audience who are watching we're going to go into Mission Control here soon um to see more of the Rover operations so please if you have questions for for uh for Lauren and Armando for those on board the falor 2 about the Rover please start dropping those now we'll do our best to get those over as well um it is so cool seeing this robot now um I've been told I think this is 1.8 kilometers right now in depth what is the what is the maximum depth your your mission will be going to with the RO with the ROV Armando get get your tomorrow is able to go to up to 4.5 km and that's precisely the side we're going to go tomorrow to get as as deep at the robot can get in order to see what we how the changing diversity and geology will look like when you go that deep just a half in the way to the deepest point of the takama trench which is about 8 something kilometers MH and by the way when we do that the rubber has to be especially prepared for the pressure that we have to endure in under such conditions mhm so cool and we're getting back into a a feed now from the ribot we're seeing it change out its tools here and drop its little basket that's so cool to see um I think it is time for us to move on to our our next site on the ship um but if the two of you are okay with it as you're walking along I'd love to ask some more questions from our audience as we go absolutely let's uh we're heading over to Mission Control next wet lab next let's go to the wet lab so just just being cautious as you walk so you don't bump your heads or anything um Lauren maybe this is a good question for you you know europa's oceans are gigantic um that's made that way because of tital heating and flexing because of Jupiter um but how do we how do we theorize having chemical energy available for life in an ocean like Europa do you have any ideas based on like microbial ecology and and bio geochemical cycling what might be possible there well I think that um if there is life on Europa it's uh very likely fueled by the process of serpentinization which is a process by which water reacts with certain types of minerals found in ocean crust um and these reactions produce hydrogen gas methane gas and low molecular weight organic materials that um can be used for life and they are used for life on Earth in places like the lost city hydrothermal vent on the Atlantis MF and um also in um oyes which are pieces of oceanic crust that were lifted up off of the seafloor and imp placed on the continent and um I spent my first postto studying these processes and looking at the intersection between microbial life and the geochemistry of serpentinization and so since we know that Europa has this very very deep ocean and that there is likely a rocky seaf Flor at the bottom um if there's life on Europa it may well be supported by the geochemical reactions between the water in the ocean and the rock of the sea floor that produces um energy and heat uh and and uh keeps the water fluid and uh could support microbial life there on Europa fantastic now are you taking us into Mission Control next we're gonna go into the wet lab first um and I'd like to introduce you to some people in there all right so this is our wet lab this is one of the smaller Labs on board the ship but this is where a lot of our water filtration takes place and I want to introduce you to um two of my new friends Drew and Katie um say hi hi to the folks at home hello um yeah you want to talk a little bit about what you're doing sure so I'm Drew Palmer uh I'm a professor of biochemistry at the Florida Institute of Technology and we're about 30 minutes south of kendi Space Center so we get to see some awesome rocket launches and and I'm Caitlyn hubrick I just graduated with my bachelor's in astrobiology about less than a month ago and I am starting my Master's Degree under Dr Palmer and I'm staying at Florida Tech and uh so part of our project is looking at uh microbiology uh which is what we do in our lab and we're also looking at bio signatures so we're trying to look at some of the signatures of the life um on the bottom of the ocean at these methane seeps and at ones that are uh may now be extinct and so I think Lauren did a fantastic job of uh talking about that um and we're applying a couple different methods um and we have one setup here and I'm going to let Katie explain this process we call solid phase extraction which allows us to take our samples home in a a lot smaller volumes yes so first we um surface water off either the ctd or the r and then I take the water samples back here there's a few steps before we get to this I first run the water through a045 micron filter we're hoping to trap our microbial friends that way I then move the water to a 22 micron filter we're hoping to trap giant viruses for one of our colleagues Mara in Spain and after I'm done filtering through those two sizes I get to the SP or the solid phase extraction so first we take the water and we add acid to it to proteinate it and by doing that what we're doing is we're making the water more hydrophobic and hopes that it will catch itself on the filter inside of our cartridge and so each of these cartridges can take about a liter of water uh what happens is I slowly run the water through here using the suction from a vacuum pump and when it's done we dry it and freeze it and our plan is to take it back to our home home lab in Florida and we hope to find a bunch of chemicals and um our job is to figure out where did those chemicals come from which one of our microbial friends is making those chemicals and hopefully we can discover what metabolomic pathway are they using to create those chemicals and that's kind of the job that we've been tasked with on the ship yeah so in addition to signatures of life we're also interested in discovering uh metabolic pathways and uh products that are new to us so new antimicrobials new comp pounds that could be used for various purposes so our lab has a lot of interest in sustainable space agriculture so we actually uh work with bacteria that come from the International Space Station and so we want to learn if we can use any of these microbes um for the purposes of improving plant growth uh on mars or the moon in future settlements um so that's been really interesting we also got a great opportunity to go to the AMA desert before we got on the boat and have some samples from the desert to compare to some of the stuff that we're going to get here so that's been a really great opportunity very cool well Drew and Katie I would love to have you both on ask an astrobiologist in the future once you've done some of the work in your laboratory with these samples so I will reach out after this show for more but thank you so much for giving us a little breakdown of the science that you're doing in the lab as well so cool than thanks K all right I'm gonna take you guys into the main lab now this is our largest laboratory space looks like a whole bunch of folks are working down here right now so as you can see we have a really really spacious lab laboratory here on falor 2 at our disposal um it's equipped with Fume hoods for working with dangerous chemicals um we have lots and lots of bench space here for all of our scientists to work on their samples we have monitors so we can continuously uh monitor the activities of the ROV as it's uh exploring the sea floor and we get constant data feeds from that um along this side we have storage freezers at various temperatures so we have ones at minus 80° which is where we store most biological samples that we intend to extract things like DNA RNA and proteins from over here we have minus 30 degree freezers for other types of storage things that NE don't necessarily need to be Frozen at minus 80 like seawater samples for example and we also have a 4 degree refrigerator which would be the the same temperature as your fridge at home for uh cold storage and uh I'd like to introduce you to a couple of folks who are working in here right now um my my two new best friends Antonio and Oscar uh so Antonio and Oscar are geologists and they have helped me so so much throughout the course of this Expedition helping me go over bimmetry data and back scatter data and finding the best path for the ROV to look for methane seats um so what are you guys up to you right now can you introduce yourselves the folks at home hi my name is osara I'm from the C CIA in Madrid I doing my PhD there H Center in the studio of Europa and Enceladus and I'm here very grateful for be here in this Oceanic Expedition my name is Anton Molina scientist in also in the C Asia and after working in few NASA missions in in MSL in perseverance also in inside being able to be here working with the Sebastian it's a privilege too to be able to you know compare the surface of other planets with the bottom of the ocean thanks guys so have you found anything interesting down at the bottom of the sea that you want to well we are sh the the magnetic and outr of this St so we are like if we are watching the our team in the Super Bowl so for geologist it's amazing to look at what that kind of rocks in on at the bottom of the ocean and that anci ancient rocks yeah we were saying the other day that the bottom of the sea is very homogeneous so you are looking for these features that allows you to to see what's below so you are going to these cracks these fractures these reliefs and now the the yesterday we were able to find these shps H that are something very interesting it's like a small island of biodiversity and also geologic diversity so in here we are trying to find a simar feature in this new area so fingers crossed and let's see what's what's next yeah that's remarkable thank you both so much for sharing that with us all right this is uh guo U I'm very honored to be working with GMO he's a local Chilean biologist and expert of uh Marine invertebrates and uh what are you working on right now looks like you've got a cool specimen oh well I am working on uh this species of s lter that um uh was very interesting because I have many species around the world and some of them are proposal that are indicator of um metan SS or another extreme environment but now we can um um discover if this hypothesis is true or not oh wow it looks like a little alien uh see well um I have some point of view different about the the when we see all this um beautiful environment many people say wow it's an alien this is the only work that we know have yeah so true so please show me where with what you are compared very cool this is this is a world inside the other world yeah this is very um few knowledge this is interesting so many many of the the animal here uh was C now uh I am working on this work to that is um animal very old because um we have found this in the fossil registration this is a Pon closely more relative with the spiders that cran for example wow that looks like an alien it does very cool thank you so much that's so incredible yeah thank you say um we think that we may have found some new species on these Dives yeah yeah um tell us it's very difficult to say samples so okay that is a new species but some of the sample we are C now are uh from animals distributed to Antarctica very very long from here so uh we need analyze to determin to see if if is a new species or not but just this CA um make me think that this a new species you know because some OT and isopod and Keno all right many many animals that are no known here in this in this place it's very very strange wow are very alien from yeah wow it's incredible it's a good reminder too of how much we don't know of Life on our planet yet either there's so many things on the seaf Flor and in the water column yeah thanks so much for showing us these all right where did we want to go to next all right let's head to Mission Control all right sound fantas this way it's a little noisy in this hallway so we're just gonna gotta kind of watch your footing as you're walking along on a ship even on a calm day hello hello why don't we let's let's cut through this way actually um so I'll jump over to another question here um for Armando um sanjoy s um a good friend of ours um wants to know if it's crazy to anticipate finding multicellular living fossils in this trench that that did did did others doubt you when you kind of uh first hypothesized that you might find these living fossils for this Mission yes well uh because uh you know this is started by me as a a kid looking fossils where I live in the takama actually and I was surprised that many years later I found papers reports on the actual Rel living relative of such things that I knew as just stones and we have one two only three report in a huge area in front of the atakama in the trench so there was a good possibility of finding them but it's like going into New York City trying to meet with a friend with no phone in your hand right and amazingly and I think it was first or second di we found them all kons rots and other kindes I mean there was even rocks that have the three of them all together and again it was as I said like traveling to the past as the orisic ocean would look like so that for me was wow moment say come on I I expected to find the things but all three together in the same rock is a true besty of that ti so for me it's what yes objective fulfill yeah fantastic so I understand you're taking us to Mission Control now we're moving through our multimedia room where we have a whole bunch of camera feeds awesome and going into Mission Control we do have to be a little quiet in here just so we don't uh disturb Pilots as they work yeah cuz we are actively on a dive right now so this is it this is Mission Control and uh first time I saw it it reminded me of Mission Control a JPL just smaller and to me to the deck of the yes yes so this is where our Pilots work um so we always have two pilots flying the ROV controlling the ROV um and as well as a science technician um we have um a partner right now is our uh watch lead so she is um directing the dive and also narrating the dive because we live stream every dive every single one no matter what time of day it is you can tune in and watch what ROV Sebastian is doing whenever he is on the SE floor that's so cool and I I'll share that at the end of our audience as well how to watch those feeds um I will say for our audience remember this is this is mission control which sounds a lot just like space exploration and so our feed is a little pixelated in the video but we are slowly getting some better resolution here to see some of our awesome uh pilots and operators of the ROV but you know we are talking to a ship out in the middle of the ocean doing this incredible research with that robot down on the bottom of the sea Flor and so yeah so we're getting slightly better resolution here now we can kind of see some of the monitors and the the controls that they're working on I wonder could we actually see the controls the pilots are using could we get closer with that without getting in their way yeah yeah absolutely and we even have a pilot here Zach uh who has been incredibly helpful um throughout this entire Expedition actually I call him Magic Eye sacks he got no things that before hello everyone I'm Zach brigh um I'm co piloting at the moment um but I am a senior supervisor here at Sebastian and on the sticks here is Tyler who is a very very good smooth pilot here as you can see cruising along and you can take a look at his controls if you want and see all the little fine movements he's doing to keep everything nice and stable it's a lot more work than it looks like but it's obviously one of the funnest jobs you could possibly do in my opinion um certainly something I this looks super highte yeah it's something I look forward to every day of course sure oh yeah now um so these are dual T4 manipulators which are hydraulically powered uh state ofthe art very very finess uh capable arms we just picked up a king crab by delicately grabbing him in the backside with these uh 3D printed oh cool rubber grippers and then um picked them and put them into one of our collection boxes can you look down with the sit camera and we'll um show him it's very angry crab in there but um oh God yeah yeah if you can let's look at him oh that's so cool so you might have to uh bring your uh camera over there but he's right in the bottom left of that screen oh yeah there he is you see him wow he's huge oh hug oh yeah we had to sneak up on that fell he was he was on the lookout for us I'll bet and then uh if you look over on this screen here we'll show you the manipulators so on this each side they're identical uh they're titanium 6,000 M rated uh you can if you're delicate enough you can pick up an egg with these that's the kind of precision control they let you have so pretty amazing piece of Kit um on this one over here you'll see the tip of it is very different and I'll show you here real quick this is a customade one that we use for collecting delicate samples and corals and things like that can you turn on the lowers for me thank you sir so this guy here you can see he has a blade and that blade is for cutting the coral and on the other side of the blade is two 3D printed rubbery pieces and that allows you to still retain control of the piece that you just cut because we try to take the minimum of any kind of animal sample we have to take of course because we don't want to harm anything we we don't have to [Music] harm I think each of these arms is in the neighborhood of 250 to 500 Grand if you were curious wow yeah it's incredible every time I see the robot arms do anything I think of 2001 A Space Odyssey and the the the um the remotely operate or the the little space bubble that uh Dave is in moving the arms and stuff yeah so cool so cool thanks Zach yeah yeah thank you so much Zach and Tyler thank you for for letting us see the operations of the Rover from mission control that's so cool yeah absolutely thanks for uh watching all right we can make our way back out of here for our audience at home just a reminder you can ask questions um for Armando and for Lauren again about the ROV the ship about the science we have a little bit time of time left in our episode here um and so we are going to do another transition walk I think in a few moments here um is the bridge our next stop one other person I wanted to introduce you to quickly and then we'll go up to the bridge um cool over here we have Nick skus he is our uh May expert hi uh hello how are you yeah hello how are you uh my name is Nick skes I'm a professor in uh of inment biology I'm working at the University of Puerto Rico for the the last uh 21 years and um I'm here in this uh expedition to provide my knowledge and expertise in in uh benic and also some pelagic invertebrates uh um most of my work uh has to do with uh looking at by diversity with different methods morphological methods genomic methods and uh I'm also here because I have um uh several uh a lot of experience with the previous Marine Expeditions so uh usually my my usual spot in the Expedition is here in this uh place where I consult my colleagues about the possible ID of uh different species we see on the screen and this is actually my favorite place too okay this is where I like to be yeah every dive we were're calling for Nick and G to come in here like we don't know what this is can you tell us and like I'm running in that's awesome so so when I see those posts and it's like a Dumbo octopus and a kinoid and some of those things uh we have some support from experts who are telling us what those things are when those post to coming out yeah yeah absolutely now the majority of the work of course we're here we're exploring if we knew everything we wouldn't be here right so the um a lot of the work most of the work will be done back in the lab when we have the specimens and we going to be able to work with them so the uh so this is just the exploration part and the collection part okay with but we do have of course a a good idea of what uh uh you know what those uh uh group of animals are but to go down to the species level that's uh much more work and okay yeah thanks Nick yeah incredible yeah thank you so much ni hi Jess Jess is data logging for me Jess Jess is my lead tech she's incredible she's done so much work on this Expedition and Muriel is our uh awesome our our contact with uh the Chilean government she's our Observer on board all right and we're going to head up to the bridge which is I think the other coolest ship all right we're just going to start the ascent here and it sounds like you have a little bit of a walk so while the two of you are walking one I want to share the ROV naming results because a lot of people who are watching right now live shared some possible names and so as you're walking I will share a few of those with you and the rest of the audience um sanjo s recommended mcgyver the robot Ian Watson who appears to have watched The Never Ending Story mentioned artall or artx um rendering reality 3D animations the user on YouTube had scratch and sniff that's kind of a fun one um like scratch the scratch the coral and take a sniff chemically um AC says naughty bot four dozen salamanders has said Advanced Roomba Peter rensburg guest is R2 D2 Star Wars fan we have a guest from Shan Mizuno who says Odin the ocean deployed exploration Network um the Scandinavian in me feels that one pretty well uh Stephanie Haney says angler biter Jacqueline bricks says ROV Subspace Pete Woodworth says ROV Servo um I love that I'm hoping that's an MST 3K reference absolutely is I know Pete very well that is totally an M awesome it seems like we're all a a community of nerds here and Geeks because I'm loving all the references to other stuff awesome and for those who are watching we do have uh questions that we're going to ask here in a moment if you have more questions please just get those to us those who are moderating the chat on YouTube can bring the questions uh to our experts who are now on the bridge for us cool and I think maybe I'll start with a couple of audience questions and then I'll do our fast the light segment um do you want to introduce the crew here who are with us first sure um so you've already met Armando and myself um Katie and Drew who are are uh bi bio signature Seekers and we have uh Antonio and Oscar who are our geologists on board awesome and for those who are tuning in for the show we're now speaking with our experts from the bridge of the falor I um so a few audience questions first um the first comes from Arif Rooney who wants to know if the seafloor is being affected by climate change oh good question I mean I I would say that pretty much every part of the the world is being a affected by climate change in one way or another um certainly the the deeper ocean I think is um still buffered from those effects somewhat but in shallower Seas we're already seeing the effects of climate change with things like Coral bleaching um fish kills uh go you name it and of course the weather effects too are are are huge and um they've changed the way that um uh ocean currents work upwelling events you know having these extreme elino linia events I mean the effects are so far reaching that um it it's hard to really sum it up in in a few statements um but a lot of work is being done um as we speak and has been done for many years um to to explore the effects of climate change on our oceans from surface to bottom and um to also project uh what those effects might be if things continue the way that they've been going um so yeah it's it's a very serious issue that's on the mind of every oceanographer so I can add one uh one thing that we have seen uh from working with marine biologists in my own department is um that there are examples of changes in the ecological distribution of organisms where as the temperature changes on the surface that changes the distribution of organisms that can move up and down the water column and that can affect Eco systems really significantly a s reflection is we are just learning about this deep now so it's i b said that we are not maybe even to to analyze these deep waters before they are affected by all these you know changes that it's happening in the planet in my case is surprising that we find entire Hills made of carbonate down there and what is will be the changes that will happen to that process are the temperature of the sea start rising up yes knows what's going happen as the pH of the of the ocean changes as well very cool um so we have a couple of questions about um How Deep The ROV is going again Armando you mentioned that earlier but we we had someone who asked if you can reiterate how deep you are right now with the ROV and how deep it will be going but we also have a question that on top of that from see on YouTube uh they want to know to what extent the biochemical pathways are altered by extreme pressures like for instance is there any modifying of protein enzyme folding structures and things like that uh in these very deep Waters well do you want to start with the the depth and then I'll take the the barile question okay so what what yes so so how deep it now now now and this very 1.8 but tomorrow we're going to go 4.5 which is the limit of the Rob that can goes kilometers yeah kilometers yes yeah and um yeah certainly uh there are organisms that exist at the bottom of the ocean that are designed to withstand these pressures and when they're brought up to the surface they completely uh lose their structure I think that the blob fish is become a pretty famous example everybody has seen pictures of the Blobfish on the internet and they're like oh God it's so it's so ugly it's all like droopy and sad looking but that's because it's been brought up uh to atmospheric pressure when it lives at you know like 300 atmospheres of pressure and so its body is just not designed to exist at at pressures that low um and and it just completely um falls apart and becomes that that Blobby shape um and there are microbes too of course that are adapted to these pressures and there are special culturing techniques that we can use to study um these um barophilic high pressure loving microbes that it's basically um these high pressure vessels um that uh maintain microbial cultures under extreme pressure and the last time that I looked into this I and I attended a talk about barophile um the report was that we have not yet found the upper limit of pressure um that life can tolerate um they went as Extreme as they possibly could go and the microbes could still grow and Thrive um which was amazing to me very cool um let's see we have a question coming in if you're monitoring ocean bioacoustics at sampling deaths I I guess are you listening on the SE Flor as well um so we have that capability but we aren't currently using it on the falcore 2 however um falor does have the capability to use bioacoustics so if we were interested in uh listening to animal communication for example at depth um falor does have those capabilities very cool um so moodles uh hi moodles um on YouTube wants to know how the discoveries and the research that you're doing is going to impact our exploration of Worlds like Enceladus um and maybe even Europa for the upcoming Europa Clipper Mission um so for all of you how do you see your research impacting our search to understand worlds beyond the Earth Yeah in our in our case my research team is already making the first approach now we know we have found here on how at what depth it will be the equivalent considering that you have less gravity in moons like in southern Europa and and the relation between pressure gravity and depth of the of the ocean and what kind of adaptation you will look for does what kind of by signature you may find you might look for if you were to go to such worlds so we're already making the first approach now we know okay so this steps we have on this guys this step we have these other guys and so on here we have we have carbonate here we have other type of rock here we have pressure of this type temperature of that type in order to make the first proposal of where would you look where would you like to go in this ecosystem like this one to say this is the most that it look like in terms of environmental parameter to what you expect to find for example in the moons of eurel and also the the exploration of Europa Andel we will look very similar of we are doing here with the Sebastian and uh also it's a proof that we can do it but we need to research and to do a better project to to send a mission to Europa Orel for me that my my focus is in in the resarch of the icy moons is very important to be here to know who the the this kind or ocean is is the the behavior of the Sal the the the the interaction between rocks and and the Sals the the the existence of metan ship is could be one of the best uh Focus to to the astrobiology that is the the main word of Armando Antonio and I so it's very excited to be here and to many we we we have many many many uh data that will be useful to to the research of icy moon in in as in s or wherever other in the solar system and actually I forgot to mention that you was supposed also to be a a instrument testing Mission we want we were in trying to get this Ramen spectrometer an instrument that will detect Inu there down there the minology or whatever we're looking for like our own geologist down there right we couldn't get it in time but it will come why is that important because this those more or less the same approach we want to then take to the those do theze Moon so if we we were are able to do that kind of research at the pressures with all the technology that means to do that and then we can also dream about maybe building such an instrument in order to CH it somewhere else I think our work in some ways contributes to that because what are the signatures that you're going to look for and so by Organics we think universally will be a signal molecules that we might be able to find for either active biology or at least the the fingerprint of Remnant bi biology yeah I I started my career as an oceanographer and became an astrobiologist as a postdoc and one thing that I noticed right away as I sort of transitioned into this new field is how similar they are in the fact that they're both incredibly interdisciplinary oceanography and astrobiology really go well together it's like peanut butter and jelly just a match made in heaven I mean oceanographers an astrobiologists think about um global scal uh geologic time scales or we're thinking about things on a planetary scale that just really really really applies well to thinking about other worlds and in particular because the search for life is the search for water so much of what we apply as oceanographers applies to the search for life on on other worlds and I think what's really interesting about this particular cruise is that normally uh on a on a research Expedition like this you have a lot of ocean graphers who are dabbling in astrobiology and here we have a science Crew That's primarily astrobiologists who we train to be oceanographers in the space of about a week so it's been an incredible experience that's so cool and again I I love the the interdisciplinary nature of your entire crew you have a large group who are working together from very different backgrounds um another question from one of our our audience members who's watching um is if you can explain some of the differences maybe both in the biology and the geology of the ecosystems from high temperature and low temperature ocean environments I I think they're thinking primarily of things like hydrothermal vents versus where you are right now in these lower temperature methane seeps serpentinizing systems and things like that for for me basically they're the same as mentioned in the beginning is energy I mean is life getting energy from chemistry directly right microorganism that were able to learn how to use iron or sulfide methine or whatever compound in order to reduce it oxidizer or whatever to get ATP and then they be the primary produc so we have this simly very different ecosystem which are basically for me the same the same the concept is the same of course one is being made one one you you find one where the plates are being made here where finding the opposite where the plates are are going on top of each other but for me it's basically they are the same different temperature ranges and that that's it yeah I mean I think you could you could certainly uh look at these two very different ecosystems and talk about how they differ chemically how they differ in terms of temperature um but ultimately the the reason why they're both so interesting to astrobiologists is because they provide a source of geochemical energy for life um and um in particular hydrothermal systems whether they're low temperature or high temperature could be a a great place for a life origin uh to happen um and so yeah I would I would agree that like ultimately what we're thinking about is um geochemistry for life and and it it really depends on what's available in terms of the planetary structure maybe you have a planet that doesn't have tectonic activity um and so hydrothermal events are highly unlikely but uh serpentinization for example where you have water Rock interactions could still be possible so you have these lower temperature hydrothermal systems as opposed to like black smokers um but in the end like it it's the geochemistry that um fuels the the the energy for life and and an origin of life and let me let me add a beautiful example that was descried a few years ago in which people found microb life doing photosynthesis at the bottom of the sea because this guys invented a type of chorh bacterial chorophyll or ropin that were able to used life being produced for the from the chining lava infrared radiation into ATP yeah so that's I mean an amazing example of how again as you said life finds a way so who knows what we're going to find elsewhere yeah even even from a you know a former place that was you know potentially uh hospitable to life so when we think about Mars Mars at one time had We Believe had a warmer core right and so how could that energy of supported life so I think what we learned here is you know immediately adaptable to our search for life beyond for sure yeah that's so cool so I'm I'm being told right now um by folks from SOI and my producer that there is an octopus on the live feed from the Rover right now um I wonder if it's possible for us to just switch over and see it for a moment for our audience um to see what the ROV is looking at on the ocean floor um I think our pilot now are controlling the ROV so we can have a look down um hopefully we can still see it they're going to try um but you know sometimes in Ocean exploration you see the things you see in a moment and then they can also disappear right away um yeah I'm not quite seeing it right now I think we we might have missed it unfortunately um that's totally okay though um so we do have a few minutes left I want to say there are more questions coming in so for all of you on the cruise I know that there's there's a website for the mission and all of you you know have ways of sharing um I'd love for our audience if it's okay to like Reach Out find ways to to learn more um I will say for our audience that SOI has really great video feeds of all the Dives they have a lot of information on the website from SOI about this Mission and other missions they have I know some of our audience members had questions about things like what kind of connection they're using right now for having all of these wonderful experts join us on the internet right now from across the world um they also have questions about like the fuel for the falcore 2 and some of the things that like like average time of duration of cruises but I think since we only have a few minutes left I do want to finish up on what we call our faster than light segment now at the very end of the show um so these are our questions that we have uh for our experts um to highlight uh a few of the ideas that come up in astrobiology all the time the questions that people have about what it's like to be an astrobiologist um many of these are my own personal questions too because I think they're a lot of fun and so I'll start off um for Armando and Lauren what is your favorite thing that life on Earth does oh oh very easy I've said it several time what I have seen in the dama at least that you find the most surprising adaptations every time I go something some new site I find something really unexpected every time the same thing so the the the reports I that I I I I report as in in science they come very easily because it's so Noel I mean you don't have to do much work as to properly describe it in order to find hey I just found the first member of entire my aquatic micrology that is able to live on the B World stuck to spider because they on the spider they're able to drop water from the B so for me it's how life adapt to the most amazing condition the most unexpected conditions I think for me um as a microbiologist the thing that fascinates me most about life is the connection between life and the non living world and how sometimes those uh that that delineation is kind of fuzzy especially at the microscopic level microbes are constantly taking non living matter and turning it into living matter and then decomposing living matter back into inorganic material and it's this constant cycling of um minerals water gases into living material that just absolutely fascinates me and and I love that um really everything on this planet life and all the non living things as well are interconnected and I just think that that's incredibly fascinating wonderful um you're out at Sea right now and you're you're seeing all these incredible organisms from microorganisms and and you know as we heard from Drew and Katie collecting viruses and other materials but also larger creatures if you could communicate with any nonhuman organism on the earth what would it be and why me a tough question um off the top of my head I would love to be able to communicate with an octopus um I know I'm a microbiologist and I always stand microbiology but um octopi are just fascinating to me um they're so so intelligent and I would love to be able to have a conversation with one my case I see just remember that we we actually did that a team of researchers that a week ago reported that were for first time is speak whale to a whale and they called the whale to come and they have this conversation of course they didn't understand much what the whale was saying but we are in a passway in order to have the first in Spees H communication which also bring us to the world of as because if we haven't yet learned to communicate with a fox or a whale how do we expect to find what a alien being if it it suddenly lands in front of you so that for me again is a very interesting question in my case I would like to talk with crows cross yes Crow yeah yeah yeah yeah they're very smart as well from my end it looks like I just lost the feed just momentarily here so I think we're going to keep working here on trying to figure out how to get the feedback I've lost audio and video um so for our audience tuning in um these are fantastic questions thank you so much I can't speak the exact kind of connection they're using or the fuel the falor 2 is using um for AC earlier you asked a question about if slowly decompressed can these life forms from the deep be brought back to the surface um and can they adapt um you know of course you know the answer to that is yes in some cases because we've seen them already on the ship um you know but in other cases there are some instances where things have adapted so much to that deep sea environment that you can't bring them back to the surface not without drastic changes to their their metabolism and biology also as Lauren mentioned earlier the Bob Fish which does change drastically when it's brought from the deep sea back to the surface it looks very unfortunately ugly it was once voted the world's ugliest organism which is so unfair that's like putting a human face into like a giant wind uh uh uh Factory wind turbine kind of thing and like blowing your face back and being like well you look ugly because it's a different environment than you evolv to um I will say so I think our our researchers came back to us we do want to share real quick uh we have we put a poll in our YouTube chat just asking how fast you think the ROV Sebastian might maneuver underwater uh we had answers like three knots five knots one knot or 10 knots of the 28 who responded uh you got it right it is three knots which is actually pretty darn fast for an ROV underwater um so Lauren and Armando it is great to see you both back here again we have just a couple of minutes left I think I'll do three more questions if that's okay um so Lauren this one is directly for you um since I know um you know since you and I are both very nerdy and you know we've talked before about some of our nerdy interests I'm wondering if you can share with our audience what stories have inspired you to want to explore more about life in the universe oh wow oh I I love that question oh my goodness so I teach an astrobiology course that's a it's a general education course that's stocked in uh so it's available to everybody not just science majors and um there are three movies that I show in that class um not just because I think that they're great examinations of alien life but also because they were so inspiring to me and so formative to me um and that is uh Ridley Scots alien um James Cameron's the abyss and uh Stanley Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey and and in particular those last two the abyss I think made me want to be an oceanographer and 2001 made me think about space as as a kid in ways that I never would have I believe very cool um yeah I love those films as well they're fantastic Armando my next question is for you um you know you've had a remarkable career already you've done so much research in the okama um you know you you've been a researcher in Spain for some time now and also a member of Blue Marble space Institute of science like Lauren and I um you've had a lot of experience in astrobiology and you know understanding our Earth but I'm curious you know as we look forward to the future of astrobiology and understanding things here on Earth and out there in space what is something that excites you about the future oh actually I'm kind of sad about the future because there's I'm going to miss so many great missions that I'm going to visit europea and salad and the colonization of Mars probably I will be very old when weize Mars and probably uh my my grand kids will get to see how we step on the surface of Enceladus for example so like oh come on give me 100 years more to to see all the Fantastic place you're going to visit but I think um doing this way I along Lauren and all the amazing team of scien along the team the crew of the SM Institute the falor and the sasan P Etc we are ping the way in order to do that I mean how we're going to think about exploring H if we don't have this kind of experience beforehand absolutely so I will be part of the St you some some way or the other fantastic um so we are at the very end if I could have just two more minutes real quick um from both of you what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind oh oh that's a good question that's a tough one um I'm going to say because I when I learned this as a first year graduate student it blew my mind and it still blow my mind every time I think about it there are more bacteria in the ocean than there are stars in the universe it nice and in my case is how little we know on how different speeches interact now we know for example all these Network and funi that are in giving different trees of different species and for to communicate with each other things that we even dream of how life is talking to each other we are not aware of what they are saying for me is the next Big Field is on is on this inter speeches communication that see that you even dream that would be taking place like as she mentioned in some part Lauren whether the microbiota or my case if I don't have the proper microorganism or the wrong microorganism I might get a depression because it interconnected and talking to my brain so this field of knowledge for me is the one that I this this is quite amazing awesome well thank you both so much um thank you to Hannah uh to Sophia who are in the background with the camera who've been doing so much work in helping us to to highlight all of the researchers on board the falor 2 thank you to Drew and Katie and Oscar and everyone else who joined us I'm so glad we had a chance for our audience to hear from so many voices of people who are working on falor 2 to make your mission possible um now I I will say at Schmid ocean.org the website for SOI there's so much information about this Mission the living fossils of the ocom trench as well as many other missions the cruises that have happened um there is the live feed we've shared in the chat you can find it on YouTube from Schmid ocean um to watch all of the live feeds from the ROV Sebastian when it's underwater uh if you want to check out Lauren's Twitter SLX she's been sharing a lot of really cool stuff there she's at dark microbio on Twitter or X um a lot more to learn there it's been so great having both of you join me for ask an astrobiologist thank you so much thanks gra was great chatting byebye awesome and for all of our audience um as usual we're so happy you joined us um we're going to share ways that you can keep up to track with upcoming episodes of ask and astrobiologist by joining the email newsletter from NASA astrobiology you get lots of information there opportunity these and events and all of the things going on across the realm from the NASA astrobiology program um of course you can always reach out to me online if you have questions for me or for our guests from the show we are always happy to try to answer them for you um if you can't get a hold of people from our show just reach out to me and I can help you to answer questions as much as possible so for everyone tuning in for this our very first ship toore episode live from the fal War I with drors Armando asio austos and Lauren Syler thank you so much for joining us and and until next time remember stay curious [Music]
