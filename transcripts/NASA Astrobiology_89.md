if you could go back in time to the beginning of your career and give yourself some advice what would you say chill out dude basically you know as I explained I you know there was there was nothing in my life that I could do except be an astronomer like you know some people need to be a dancer or a poet or I just there was nothing else I wanted to do but be a an astrophysicist and I just I worked so tirelessly and you know of course you have to to be an astronomer it's really hard work but I wish I could have if I could go back and be like yo man it's going to be okay like you can work like maybe like 5% less and use some of that time to to take a walk or something um that's what I would tell myself or just have a little bit less anxiety about whether or not this is going to work out
