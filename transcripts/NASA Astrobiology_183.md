thank you welcome aboard the jordy's resolution a massive research vessel for scientific ocean Drilling and a floating Laboratory did you know that scientists all over the world are conducting research in Earth's ocean much of which will help us better understand the search for life in outer space that's right this research is known as astrobiology and it strives to understand how life came to be how life evolved and whether or not life is elsewhere in the universe in order to understand the origin of life on Earth we need to look at the past luckily the Jody's resolution is also a time machine well sort of a lot of Earth's histories actually stored within ancient rocks and months which are collected on this ship in what we call of course by Julian dip into the ocean floor and examine in this pores we can travel back in time and learn much more about what the air used to be like we can learn about Earth's ancient atmospheres for molecules trapped within the course about how our planet evolved and Morse through volcanoes and earthquakes we 've learned about how life began and evolved through microfossils and we can even learn about the limits of Life by looking for organisms that live in extreme environments places are extremely cold hot lack oxygen or don't rely on the sun to survive this can help NASA scientists and Engineers understand if it's possible for life to exist on other planets that might have harsh environments as well and speaking of other lives in other worlds that you know one of the precursors for one of the instruments on Mars 2020 Rover was tested and developed right here the Sherlock instrument is on Mars right now using its cameras lasers and other technology to search for chemical clues that may provide signs of past life so from below the sea floor to the outer reaches of space there's inspiration for everyone on the dody's resolution [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign
