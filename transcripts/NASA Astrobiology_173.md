[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] we hope you enjoyed Sharia last night and we pick up this morning with tremors chemical fingerprints and climates and our first speaker is Andrea Bryant from the University of Chicago foreign [Applause] PhD student at University of Chicago and today I will talk about investigating the use of long periods seismology to explore Titan's interior I'm aware that um I'm actually quite new to seismology myself when we began a couple years ago so um I will try to do a little bit of background for everyone all right so starting with uh Cassini we learned a lot about the saturnian system but especially for this study we learned a lot about Titan and so um there was actually a probe the huggins probe that landed on the surface of Titan and you can if you go on YouTube you can Google it and or you can YouTube it and see the landing um there it's lending through the haze and you see some water ice Pebbles on the surface and there's so much I could say about Titan but for the sake of time I'll just say it's an amazing natural astrobiology laboratory and um I'm very excited to do some theory about it um okay so here is what we currently know about Titan um and so we know that there is a liquid water ocean underneath um a very thick shell of ice so it's between 50 and 150 kilometers deep we don't know the exact compositions of this ice shell or the ocean but we do know that there's water there um and also there could be some high pressure ice underneath the ocean and this actually has very big astrobiological implications because it could actually act if there is high pressurized it could act as a barrier from there's the enrichment of the ocean for potential life um if it's there and so um yeah so that's something that seismology can help us to constrain whether or not that's there um okay so this brings me to NASA dragonfly and so dragonfly is a rotor craft that will launch in 2027 um and it'll take about six years or so to get to Titan but this instrument will be loaded with many many different instrument packages that are really there's a very large Focus for Astro bio and in particular the seismometer um which is going to be on the other Underside you can see here it's like dangling or it's up under the rotocraft but it's going to be tethered it's tethered and so it'll be lowered down at each location on Titan that's going to visit and then measure the seismic activity there and there also these geophones which are essentially less sensitive seismometers and they're a bit smaller that are going to be there's two under under the underside of the skids and so in particular the seismometer the geophones and other instruments within the this drag met package um are going to be looking to measure habitability okay so um dragonfly says melody seismology in a nutshell will help us to constrain the interior structure of Titan more precisely and so seismology um similarly like on Earth has helped us to understand more about the actual interior of Earth to like very great detail and so we hope to be able to do a bit of the same um on Titan and so some possible causes of Titan Quakes will be tidal flexing or Quail volcanoes and then also like ice cracking events of various kinds and then this is of course not a non exhaustive list and so we'll be able to put like very precise um more precise hopefully measurements on what's actually going on there okay so now this brings me to the namesake of this talk long period seismology so um I'm talking about so if you're familiar with seismograms we have the Body Waves or those are the p waves compressive waves and the sheer waves S waves and then we have um later on we have these long these surface waves and so I'm looking as opposed to using Body Waves investigating um and particularly with these I'm looking at methane cloth rate models what if I were to use the surface wave information particularly dispersion information to be able to try to learn about Titan and maybe about the eyeshadow thickness so let's see what I found okay so starting with methane clathrates um I for those of you who don't know what that is um so a clothway is essentially I like to say a water cage and so you can see um I don't know if you can see those um it's essentially um a structure of water molecules around and they're entrapping a single molecule and and the case of or in my the study the molecule we're looking at would be methane okay so imagine there's this molecule and now we have tens of kilometers of this these methane clathrides and we think that this could be very possible and very plausible for the Titan Photon conditions and I think I forgot to mention Titan surface is 94 Kelvin so on the surface methane we have a hydrological cycle but it's a methane hydrological cycle um six percent or five or six percent of the atmosphere is methane and so we have instead of lakes of water lakes of hydrocarbons um and lakes of methane um so um when we have this liquid methane and ice under Titan temperatures and pressures they will readily form these methane clathrates and this has been shown in the laboratory so it's thought that they're most likely will be lots of these methane clathrates on Titan um and so the models that we considered um were essentially they were all the same so we were looking at 100 kilometer thick ice shell and just varying the um the clathrated lid thickness so um the cloth rates were just at the surface so hence the cloth rate lid um and um yeah these are all spherically symmetric models they were generated with an open source code called Planet profile if you're interested in generating this it's on GitHub also you can I couldn't show you how to get it or you can just Google it um and there's a ton of other bodies you can look at there as well um and so we simulated a magnitude 3 quick and then these were the data that we'll be looking at come from a three kilometer Source step so three kilometers deep within the ice so um the from the study um I this was led by Angela marusiak at um who is now professor at University of Arizona uh and so we actually saw some small differences in dispersion between two of the models in particular that we're looking at and in that paper so that was the 10 kilometer cloth rate lid and the um pure water is shell and so just for this is a primer about dispersion it's related to the material properties of the ice shell and particularly in the case of elastic waves that we're looking at here and so this wave speed depends on frequency and that's kind of like the meat of what dispersion is is seeing how the wave speed or the group velocities they change as a function of frequency and so we saw like about two percent difference a two percent difference between the dispersion so that's looking at this group velocity curve here it's very small differences but they're small enough that if you have a really high Precision seismometer you could actually detect that which is actually I found that quite intriguing so I was like well let's dig deeper and see what else we can find um so this brings me to the setup of the um on the project of this long period study that I'm leading now so um I take theoretical dispersion curves so it's all theoretical but these are extra theoretical um and I can explain what that means later um or if you if you ask um so theoretical this version curve they're generated with a code called minios and elaborate on that and then take these other axi Simmons it says that's another code so the different methods of doing these things um the seismograms to create these mock observational data of which I would go and pick and calculate by hand and with a computer the group velocities for each Titan input model I'm not sure that I'm across a range of distances um and frequencies so um now just I'll talk about the theoretical group velocities um and so these are looking at group velocity as a functional frequency so group velocity on the y axis and frequency on the X axes and I'm looking at different modes so I'll talk about what the screw velocities and phase velocities are and or group velocities are and then what the modes are um so group velocity if we were to look if you look on the right hand side it's um the the actual velocity of the like wave packet that's encapsulating the like more the bigger larger scale structure of our seismograms and the phase velocities that's another measure of dispersion um it is the actual velocity of the Peaks and so when you have the groove velocity not equal to the phase velocity you you know you have dispersive wave um and so um the terminal information so mode so if if you remember from physics the like wave on the string analogy um or it's not analogy but the wave on a string representation of modes um the fundamental modes will be here there's no node first overturn one node second third second and two and three nodes uh accordingly or respectively and then you can go all the way up to I mean as many nodes and modes as you'd like to um so for this study we actually looked at up to three thousand uh overtones to create an entire seismogram but here um we know that most of the information of this surface wave that we're looking at and I forgot to mention that it's a Rayleigh wave um it was it would normally be in the fundamental mode but um there's a surprise that I'll show you in the next slide um and so essentially what we found was that when we're comparing um when we're looking at the data and I I went and used actually some this other data set um and took the seismograms themselves and um calculated the group velocities as opposed to just them being spit out from a code for me um consistently that um the dispersion profiles um they're when we look at the different interior structures they do like differ slightly but then when we lay them on top of each other essentially like there isn't various little differences and it's so small that you probably would not and not probably wouldn't they would be smaller than what we could observe um on Titan um so and then also the Israeli waves we thought that they would be the information would be in the fundamental mode but actually it was in the first overtone which is a little interesting and it's consistently so okay so there's this yellow line is the first overtone and so this blue little Cloud thing is the one Sigma standard deviation from these group velocity measurements which are taken over a range of this instances and frequencies um and so um yeah it's it's a pretty pretty strong uh thing that's happening or signal that we're seeing for it not being and the fundamental mode um and so then that just shows that this method um we wouldn't be able to use Body Waves to um this sorry the surface wave this particular surface wave as um to diagnose the thickness of Titan's eyeshadow so that's intriguing and so um I will dig deeper and and see um more about that in the future all right so a quick summary I use data driven models of Titan's Interiors or to compute Titan synthetic seismograms for comparison to real data that we'll get from dragonfly in the mid 2030s and in the study we investigate energy trapped in the eye shell to determine the structure of Titan and the presence of surface clathrates um and AKA long period seismology And while the surface waves observation that we saw in the study did not clearly determine eggshell thickness we can constrain it using body wave arrivals so pns waves and if you're interested in learning more about isolation seismology and then particularly about some of the methodology that we were implementing talk to me or also consult Simon staler's paper uh it's very looking also at other icy ocean worlds as well and then understanding the composition of Titan's interior especially the ice shell and ocean will have important implications for astrobiology and habitability studies so thank you so much foreign yes good hi nice talk um so presumably like in the lab we don't have like kilometers of class rates so what does it take to extrapolate from just this lab made amount to how it'll behave when it's this much as a medium yeah so we use this paper called by calassova and soton um I think it's in like 20 20. um but that was their paper is where we got the actual thermal thermal models to model to model this for the cloth raids yeah thank you for the talk um I I have a question that may be outside of the scope of what you do but um I know that the eye shelf thickness can be a proxy for for heat loss and that can also kind of um uh provide clues as to whether the ocean may be like a transient feature like or a more long lived feature is that anything you can determine using the data that may be collected by dragonfly or anything like that or is that outside of the scope of because I mean the the longevity of the ocean like if there is like a like a liquid water ocean um beneath the ice layers that could have implications in the habitability whether it's like persisted over geologic time scales yeah I mean I mean we can constrain the the seismology the composition and the depth but regarding yeah it's a little bit outside of my preview uh okay I apologize no it's okay yeah good question thank you uh so I'm curious um what is the amount of confidence we have that there's a high pressure ice layer on the bottom instead of you know a direct contact with the ocean yeah we don't have like any confidence to say I mean we think that there could be I think there's definitely a big Camp thinking that there is um but it's highly debatable so if I were to like look at that diagram um I could put a big sorry going way back um there um for the high pressure eyes you could put like a big question mark there because we don't know if it's there we don't know how thick it is it's like really deep down we know there's no molten core in Titan from some Casini measurements but high pressure rise we have a zero idea um but it could be there um and so especially because it's so cold but then yeah and if it is there there's different scenarios also that if we have porous high pressure eyes and it's really saline and then it could still we could still have some enrichment of the ocean so even if it is there depending on its composition they could still be in Richmond of the ocean um so it may not necessarily be a barrier to life also if it isn't thank you yeah hi nice store I would like to ask you if you have considered the influenza of the titleistic patient in your mothers always the title dissipation oh do I incorporate that if you have considered that influence in the generation of a Titanic earthquake Titan Quake sorry so have you considered the influences of the title dissipation um no we're not considering title dissipation um in the models or we're assuming there's a very perfect Titan but I also don't think um we're assuming we're considering attenuation within the ice shell but title dissipation um we're not really thinking about I think and I don't think we need to yeah that that um about earthquake if you um synthesize the sex meet analysis and the influencing of the technology patients I don't know how much is a contribution of the title so that's why I am asking you if you had considered this um we haven't considered this parameter in your modern yeah I don't know if it has like a huge um so so the title I don't think that we'll have uh like a large effect which is why we've left it out yeah yeah also the bank of the distance between the Titan and Saturn so yeah I don't know that's why I was asking you yeah thank you so much one more question so uh um I'm not a planetary geologist but I I do know that one of the limitations for our understanding of the interior of Mars with the Insight mission was that we only had a single seismometer yeah um in your data are you modeling uh basically seismology being measured by a single seismometer and you think having multiple seismometers on the surface of Titan would give you further resolution in terms of the thickness of methane clathrate lid um yeah 100 it would be amazing to have multiple seismometers um on Mars also on Titan but I think just with experimental Mission constraints like they can only have one have you done any modeling to see if you could get further resolution with multiple seismometers um so it's not so it's not really about like getting the resolution with um so we can generate perfect seismograms um it's just how well we'll be able to see um and detect um things I see it's easier to like triangulate events and things with um when you have multiple seismometers um but yeah we can essentially if we we could see like deeper events if we have more seismometers we'd have just greater sensitivity overall um but we unfortunately don't have that yeah so we have to do what we can with one thank you Andrea yeah [Applause] so our next speaker is Hector Delgado Diaz from the University of Washington good morning oh God good morning everybody uh my name is Hector uh I'm gonna be talking about the climates of gl513b this is a work I've been doing with Rory Barnes from University of Washington and Russell Dietrich and Marina uh to give you an outline I'm gonna first give you an introduction and convince you why we study gl514b uh I'm gonna show you what are the factors that we consider that affect availability then I'll show you the methods that we use and then the results follow my conclusion and the Future Works that are deemed important to continue doing so we study this planet in 2022 uh Maria damaso and his collaborators they discover gl514b and what's particular about it it's that it has a high eccentricity eccentricity it's how circular the orbit is and when it's a higher centricity that means that the orbit is kind of like an oval shape and usually when we study exoplanets we look for planets that are within the habitable zone and this planet because it's very oval shape it kind of Falls in and out of the Habit also so that makes it a particular object to study it also as you can see from the properties it also orbits a Android star which is one of which is the most abundant star in our galaxy and universe and with that in mind uh when we look at the uh the multiple orbits that could happen in this planet uh these are just simulations of what are 0.45 eccentricity or B would look like uh we see that they all go in in and out of this green shaded region which is the habitable zone that we can see that the habitable is one of the of the star and the dash line is just the the best fit orbit we still see it that all of them go through in and out so that's what makes it uh very important to study for habitability since we've never done that before and another reason why we want to study gl519b in this graph I'm showing you here a plot of the eccentricity over the orbital period of the planet so how long it takes the planet to go around the its Hoster the size of the of the bubbles it shows how much solar installation or how much of radiation from the start it's falling into into the planet uh on the top right corner you can see the bubble for what would be like an earth installation so how much uh sunlight we receive the bigger the bubble the more radiation the planet is receiving uh gray gray dots represents we don't have data for for the installation so they don't show any any uh any information about that but in particular when we look at gl514b which is in the middle uh in the middle of these graphs on the top side we see that it's almost unique to it and when we have an orbital period that long around an mdorf it gives us a uh an idea uh a better view to use Next Generation telescopes such as ground telescopes to to putting them and be able to directly observe them if the planet is too close to the star the planet would be really hard to to see with with direct observation uh there's another planet that is really far away which we see it at 250 orbital periods on the right side but it has a lower eccentricity so that way that's why we don't care much to study that one there is a planet with 0.5 uh greater than 0.5 x in 360 but it has a shorter orbital period uh than gl514me so it might be really hard to direct observe and we want a planet that we can study in the future and with that in mind the Next Generation telescope such as the uh such as the oh my God uh the extremely large telescope uh it it would be a telescope that should be able to observe uh gl514b this graph is just showing uh what is the maximum angular separation that the planet needs in order to be observed and the planet to start flux ratio uh meaning that the bigger planet to start fluctuation that means we can observe it better and in the Dutch line that represents the boundary to be observed uh to to the planets that could be observed with the elt the extremely large telescope and we expect that gl514me will fall fall within that boundary so we will plan to use elt to observe this planet now I hope I convinced you why study Geo 514b so now uh I want to talk about like what are some factors affecting habitability um so there's many factors when we talk about habitability there's so many things that we can think of uh but I we focus on the ones that we've seen that in other papers that have shown that uh these are the most that affect an impact the availability and these are the eccentricity that I mentioned is how oval or secular that orbit is the obliquity in which is that tilt of the rotational axis from the plane of of orbit from the star system the Precision angle is the angle of wobbling of that rotation axis and the partial pressure of CO2 which is how much CO2 is built up in the in the atmosphere of the planet and uh difficulties I told me to talk I don't go into much details as to why them but those are the papers that we mostly Focus uh show the uh these are the factors affecting habitability that we want to use for gl514me we use uh software called V Planet which is an open source code that has 11 11 physical processes that simulate habitability for our planet uh it includes uh binary systems or includes the the radiation for the star the or the disturbances in the Orbee the services in the rotation many others but they want the one part that we use from the planet is the one called Poise which is an energy balance model and what it essentially means this graph is a good explanation I did not do this graph uh facilitated and what an idea in in essence what it is it's a balance of all the incoming solar radiation that comes to the planet and how much is that it's either absorbed by the planet or reflected back to the two space uh Poise does now is a cloud free cloud free uh energy balance model so that we don't take into account the the reflected uh sunlight by the by clouds in the atmosphere so that means that we mostly focus in in two parts of the of the energy balance model which is how much is absorbed by the by the by the surface of the planet and on the right side top side you can see that it says are going along with radiation how much of that is being radiated by by the atmosphere itself in in longer wavelengths uh in in essence this is the the equation that we use uh to explain it to explain it in a in a easy way I would say that the first term is it represents that absorption of the heat from the surface uh the second term represents how much is being dissipated throughout the atmosphere so atmospheric circulation of the heat uh the third term is just shows the irradiation to space and that should all of that although all of that should balance to the fourth term which is how much of income in solar radiation is falling into the planet um so another thing that Poise does and this is good to know is that it not it's not only an energy balance model but it also calculates uh the ice sheets or how much ice it's flowing around the planet so is the planet covering full eyes is the planet it's just ice free meaning that it's all water or is the planet has a combination of polar caps or other types of ice configurations which are really important for habitability since uh Earth uh Earth we've seen Earth throughout time has how much the ice has changed in that surface um and another part of the of the v planet uh that we think of is that outgoing longer variation there are many many ways there are many theories on how do we calculate that how much of that radiation is being dissipated to space um there's uh in the planet there's three of them uh from spigo 2009 and Williams and casting 1997 and Northern googly 1979. so spigo and and north and Coakley those two are going along with radiation they're just as a function of temperature and and Williamson Casino includes a component of partial pressure of CO2 and we can see in this graph how much of that outgoing normal radiation over surface temperature it changes uh um Hing is a functional temperature but with the difference that Williams and casting when we change the partial pressure of CO2 in this case I'm having a partial pressure of simulating Earth's CO2 abundance in the atmosphere and we see that it kind of it gives a more realistic version of how much of that radiation is being dissipated to to space so that means for our purpose of this of this study we use uh Williams and casting 1997 model to simulate how much radiation is being dissipated yeah oh and and to say the uh to say that this William and casting model is only valid from uh negative 83.15 degrees Celsius to 86.85 degrees Celsius meaning that anything that goes if the planet gets too cold or too hot from those boundaries that means that uh our calculations of the outgoing lower radiation are not exactly um accurate So within them as if it's too cold that the planet is just completely as Noble and if it's too hot we just demean as a planet completely ice free in terms of the of many other parameters so we're talking about partial pressure CO2 eccentricity obliquity uh and precision angle there's other other parameters that go into an energy balance model and an ice sheet flow diagram so uh here I am just showing you most of the other parameters some some of them are arbitrary others are Earth's value uh so you know as every model we had to make assumptions and these are some of the assumptions for example uh the ebm meaning the energy balance model we run it seasonally instead of annually so every season we check uh that we check that energy balance we run it every for four years uh so it's run for four years and we run it every 500 years to calculate it and uh we use the Wheelhouse in casein olr model which is outgoing radiation the initial Global temperature we use 14.85 degrees Celsius which represents a pretty pre industrial Earth's temperature we have the deposition rate of snow which is that's from Earth's value uh and then the heat capacity of the land of the water and the albedos they all come also from Earth's value um now the land fraction is analogous is similar to it so uh so we use a 25 Lan and the 75 is just water cover uh it's covered by water to outdo our uh our our simulations we divide it into four simulations uh we first wanted to find values of CO2 uh eccentricity obliquity and precision angle that meet the affiliate protocol I'll explain to you what the filet protocol is uh the second simulation we studied the latitudinal temperature for various eccentricities the third one we did a parameter sweep of eccentricity and obligories and therefore one with the parameter sweep of CO2 and obliquity uh all of this we run all the simulations for one million years and I did a total of 960 simulations why 960. just because no specific reason um and all of these are just static simulations meaning that the obliquity eccentricity and precision angle of the planet are not evolving over time so that means that for future work just uh spoiler we want to do a dynamic evolution of how we see this eccentricity of liquidum precision angle evolve because we see that on Earth we see those values changes for the first one the the filet protocol is just a functionality of ice latitudinal ABM tenacity so it's a protocol an intern comparison project from the Cuisines uh project and and what they want is to do an intern comparison on the different EVMS and the first Benchmark case is to achieve Global mean surface of 288 Cummins and that's what we did and we look for what are those values and we found many possibilities but this one I'm showing you here is just the centricity of 0.45 and obliquity of three degrees a Precision angle of 90 degrees and a partial pressure of CO2 or seven seven bars we noticed that 7 bar CO2 is the one that gives the most uh uh the most stable climates throughout the different bars uh uh pressure pressure of CO2 in here uh I'm just showing you how those the in the first panel is the insulation is being received per latitude on the say on the top right panel is the surface temperature how it varies on the bottom left is a is the ice melon ice mass balance meaning that a clear color ice is being deposited dark color is being lost and on the right we have the outgoing lower radiation and what we see is that all of this uh correlates so we have a validation of our code that is working as issue uh so that's why we wanted to do this as our first simulation we're just trying to like uh do kind of like a sanity shake for a code we then did a studio latitudinal temperature for various eccentricities and in here I'm just showing remember that eccentricity is 0.45 but if we look at the error value of of their calculation is plus minus 0.4.15 to 0.14 so if we want to study this to three sigma confidence that means we have to do a range of of 0.03 eccentricity to 0.9 eccentricity so that's what I'm showing here how the different temperatures uh of the planet vary through the one million year calculation on the top one it looks weird yes it is weird and it's because the simulation gets too cold and it goes out of boundary for our simulation of the Williams and casting so that means the plan is just really cool and it doesn't um it doesn't get to to run anymore because it just fell out of the boundaries so for that one uh the planet falls out of boundaries as a noble State the second one is uh we get a global mean surface temperature of 26 degrees so it's really hot meaning it's a nice free state and for the last one we have a 0.9 eccentricity but the planet gets too close to the star of the beginning so it's it's so hot that it's just for a lot of boundaries from the other side however because the planet eccentricity is so long that means its Winters are very long so when we're able to lower the eccentricity so that the code could run we see that the global mean temperature is about six degrees so it's not that warm so it's a we get as a noble State even though it's a global temperature of six degrees solution simulation 3 and Amazon uh this is just a parameter sweep of eccentricities and obliquities how those eccentricity obliquity affects the uh the state of the planet we see ice freeze the dark blue uh snowball will be the gray part purple is a polar ice cup ice caps and the outer boundaries is a region whether it's too hot or too cold and we see that at least polar ice caps are formed this is important because Earth has ice caps so that's what we're trying to achieve if we can see ice caps in the planet uh so this shows up for different accents region of obliquity that happens and we look at the global mean temperature for those different centricities and obliquities and in we get a 14.85 degree celsius at Atomic Century 0.4 2.5 regardless of the obliquity so we get kind of like a stable Clement irregardless of obligatory for different eccentricities lastly we did a primary sweep of this time instead of changing eccentricity we change the CO2 and we also see that polar ice caps are formed and on the right side we get uh we see that how many of those simulations are either polar cups uh ice free or Noble and we see that a lot of them are ice free and snowball uh there's very little of polar caps but there is still a glimmer of hope because they still form so that's a good thing that happens and and then I'll leave you to the conclusions so I just want to cut it there but in essence we did find uh temperature uh conditions that can give a temporary climate such as pre industrial Earth 7 bar CO2 would be suggest that is the most stable one for to create those polar ice caps most of the planet states are funny they're iceable or snowball and precision angle does not impact much the eye state of the planet and we don't need direct observations to assess the habitability of gl5 for Timmy and I'll leave you there thank you [Applause] okay sorry so we have time for one quick question uh great talk um so it seems like you're suggesting that uh snowball state is a is a permanent State and I'm curious as to whether or not your simulation show any deviation from that um because you know we know that that's a state that has been influxing our planet so I just I wonder if your simulations can account for coming out of a snowball State yeah so this so at least the simulation what so what is showing is that the uh what I'm showing here on the on this histogram plot is the last state at the at the end of the simulation uh but uh papers have shown that one million year is a good enough time for c for uh simulations uh for climates to stabilize the thing is that because we're doing a static Evolution we don't expect it to change but if we add the dynamic part which is like changing in obliquity and eccentricity and precision I go while we're evolving the planet then that could that could change uh and it could be it could have been like a snowball State at one point and then change to something else but for this for the static ones we're not we're not expecting this to change since there's not much fluxes [Applause] Karen next speaker is Evelyn McDonald from the University of Toronto foreign [Music] thank you uh can everyone hear me excellent all right Hi I'm Evelyn I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto and I'd like to talk about some simulation work that I've been doing with my collaborators they're funded by answer so I work on Emirates which for the purposes of this talk I'm defining as roughly earth sized rocky planets in the habitable zone of an M dwarf star and so because because the star is small the planet is close to the star so we assume it's totally locked um so this this diagram over here just kind of shows what that looks like so we have the star somewhere over here um light from the Star hitting the planet at the sub Starlet point which is always at the same place because the planet has a permanent day and night side and the Terminator is kind of a cool word for the divining line between the day side and the night side so just kind of keep that in mind I'll be using some of these terms now the base assumption is that these planets have what we call an eyeball climate so again we have the star here the assumption is that the night side is frozen and part of the day side is unfrozen near the sub Stellar point where it receives the most radiation and you would assume that's a circle this is actually an oversimplification but it's kind of a good starting point so I have a few questions that I'd like to be trying to answer today first of all how does Lan configuration affect Emirates climates how does the mass of the atmosphere affect their climates I'll be answering those using a 3D GCM General circulation model called exoplasm and then the next part is can we tell these climates apart and observations I'll be using a radiative transfer model based on my exoplasm simulations to look into that so to start I'd like to talk about land configuration and so if the recall the eyeball climate we kind of have a cartoon of this here the idea is what happens if we put land in that warm deglaciated region because that's the region that's probably the most interesting but what's going on in the surface there um should have a climate effect presumably so I've done this in a systematic way as I'm showing over here basically we have two opposite continent configurations where either all of the land is in a circle at the substellar point so that's the substellar continent over here with ocean everywhere else and if if the ocean is cold there's ice instead of open water and then the opposite sub Cellar ocean putting land everywhere except for a circle at the substellar point where there's water we vary the size of the circle in all of these simulations going from zero to 100 percent so here you can see that sometimes there's ice free ocean and sometimes there's not and these ones there's always some ice free ocean because of where the water is so now what what happens to the climate when we run the climate model with these there's a lot going on here so let's let's just take it slowly on the on the left here we have substellar continent models with different land fractions so this First Column is the land map just looking straight down at the center of the day side with the night side not shown and the second column here shows the precipitation and evaporation so red is evaporation blue is precipitation you'll notice it always rains at the substellar point and water evaporates from the ocean everywhere else on the day side and this is true for these ones these substellar Ocean Models as well you get clouds and precipitation in the middle of the day side and over ocean regardless of where the land is so the water comes toward the center of the planet where it's warmest Rises it condenses out and you get rain so we also get kind of a range of of temperatures depending on how much land there is with high land fraction planets having hot and dry day sides which is what's shown in this column here so these are some pretty significant climate differences um like on a spatially resolved level this is what this looks like globally on the x axis we have dayside land fraction so the size of of the circle for these two landmap types and on the y axis we have temperature on the left and water vapor on the right um you'll notice that there's the largest discrepancy between the two partial dayside land cover so when it when it's not an aquaplanet or a land Planet somewhere in between it really matters a lot where the land is because that influences the amount of ice free ocean that's available on the planet for evaporation and putting moisture into the atmosphere and these curves kind of follow each other so this is already a climate uncertainty that we need to kind of think about um now let's make it more complicated by changing another parameter the mass of the atmosphere so like land configuration that's not necessarily something we can know about a planet in advance so I varied it in my simulations the idea is basically make the atmosphere thicker or smaller that's what I've tried to show over here and these are the same curves that were on the previous slide but this time for a range of pressures so increasing the amount of N2 in the atmosphere um and again you get the same land fraction and land configuration dependence but in addition to that the curves are shifted up or down depending on the pressure so they overlap it's very confusing we like there's clearly some climate effects here that need to be paid attention to and so then the next thing we want to know is can we ever know this stuff can we tell these apart in observations so the way these planets will be observed is with Transit spectroscopy which is what jwst will do um I have a kind of image of what that looks like basically when the planet passes between the Observer and the star it blocks out some of the Stars light which is measurable and there's a wavelength dependent contribution to the amount of light blocked depending on the molecules in the atmosphere and where they scatter and absorb So based on what wavelengths block the most light we can tell what's in the atmosphere this is really hard to do for small planets but this is like the theory of it so the question then because most of the water if you'll recall was at the sub Stellar point is how much water is making it to the Terminator because the Terminator um sorry the the Terminator is where like we're getting actually the photons from we can't directly image the substellar point so we're getting the light passing through the Terminator so I have some profiles here of specific humidity for the two different types of land map this is just all at the same pressure basically we have pressures so going upward in the atmosphere on the y axis and specific humidity on the x axis for near the substellar point and near the Terminator so looking her relationship between the amount of water in the Rainy Zone and the amount of water we can see um subcellular Ocean Models all look pretty much the same which makes sense there's water there there's a bit less at the Terminator but it's still there for the substellar continent models the ones with a lot of land have much less water at the Terminator but still some so maybe we can tell the difference so now I've I'd like to show some synthetic Transit Spectra I've made using only water so I've ignored all other possible things that could contribute to this so on the x axis we have wavelength that the instrument is observing at and on the y axis we have what I've defined as amplitude so basically the difference between the transit depth that you get so the amount of light block from the star and the the minimum amount so either the amount just by the rocky planet itself or the lowest cloud deck or the lowest part that that would be visible because it's really this difference that we're looking to measure more so than the actual size of the planet itself so these are just for a few selected simulations from my parameter space and so varying only the land and the pressure we get quite a sizable difference in these water vapor spectral features so these could these are kind of a range of what a specific Planet might produce um then on the bottom we have the Cloudy version so these same ones but with clouds included in the radiative transfer and you'll notice that the features are smaller but also they're not all affected the same way depending on where like how many how many clouds are at the Terminator which varies depending on different factors so it's a bit confusing um I'd like to just focus on on this feature though so I'd like to show like basically the top of this feature for a variety of models and that's what this looks like on the left we have the cloud free version on the right we have with clouds included again these curves kind of follow the same shape as the temperature and water vapor from a few slides ago but when you add clouds it gets a lot worse unfortunately basically there's there's like some correlations in a cloud free version these high pressure low land models have much taller spectral features so you might be able to detect that or tell the difference but then when we add clouds what happens is that these Waters these models with the most water vapor are also the cloudiest of the Terminator and consequently the like the effect of clouds on the spectrum is much higher so like that it gets like artificially subdued so it looks like these dry models over here have the most water but that's not actually true so observing this it's going to be very hard to tell what's going on on the surface of the planet um try to end on a happy note um there's a huge range of climates here we can't necessarily tell them apart but a lot of them could be habitable and we might be able to detect water in some of them so like I'm still like cautiously optimistic I guess but it's it's more important I think to account for the fact that there are these unknowns instead of just trying to make assumptions about what's going on on the surface of the planet based on its Transit Spectrum I'll stop here and I'm happy to take any questions [Applause] hi uh great talk um really interesting stuff so I'm wondering about you have these simulated Transit Spectra I'm and it looks a little uh pessimistic based on how close those lines are but jwst has been delivering some exquisitely Precision precise Spectra so I'm wondering if you have plans to model like the noise properties and stuff and it like actually simulate jwst observations of these kind of things to see if you can actually distinguish maybe a few things because the trans inspector are so precise um because of this incredible instrument that we have yeah it would be good to add some instrumental noise to them it's also really hard to do that accurately um there's like it's it's harder to get precise Spectra for these smaller stars like most of what's been coming so far is or sorry smaller planets bigger bigger planets are easier to get like good data from but yeah there's um there's more Photon noise in the far or mid infrared compared to the near infrared so I think it'd be good to focus on that but yeah it would be like it might be possible to tell some of them apart but it would be a good thing to look into thanks for the question Taylor plattner at Georgia Tech great talk also just wanted to say all the other talks were very interesting this morning um and it's super cool I used to do exoplanet stuff when I was in undergrad so you're taking me back to I guess my old days sounds like I'm an old person um but uh I had a question on you know I know you're doing simulations but are you going to eventually like look at specific planets and if so do you have like a I don't know there's kind of like I used to do this like uh development like a prototype instrument to put on ground based telescope to like vet out interesting planets so I didn't know if you had like a I don't know anything to like vet out interesting planets to you like with jwst or with any other like telescope um sorry if that's a terrible question but just curious no it's an interesting point I'm not an observer I'm mostly just waiting excitedly for other people to get data and like I would say the one I'm most excited about is probably Trappist 20 but excited and apprehensive at the same time because it'll be really sad if they don't find an atmosphere on it but yeah ground ground based observations would be like another good way to to look at these planets because you can get such a bigger telescope okay it is with jwst how often is it like looking at like if you had some planner that you're really interested in how often it is it like looking at that planet or would you like I don't know I know Tess was another one that people like were really excited about so I didn't know if that was easier to like get data like to see that same Planet more and I know yeah like you were saying it's not as great everybody loves JW wst for a reason yeah well Tess is a planet finder so it it's found a bunch of candidates um so like anything that starts with toi I mean tests object of interest is what they're called um and then jwst is kind of needed or that's like some large telescope is needed for follow up to actually characterize their atmospheres because it's much easier to find the planets than to see what's in their atmospheres especially with such thin ones did that answer the question yeah yeah good talk thank you thank you so much we have time for one quick question all right that was also super I'm pretty far removed from this exoplanet stuff because this is sick so um I I have a question that I apologize for my inability to ask a more specific question about your work that's just a lack of my understanding but um I'm curious that they were talking about how like this Exquisite Precision with jwst and and all this stuff and so is how far off well I'll preface by by saying um the past couple of decades as I'm sure you're aware our understanding of planetary habitability has really shifted with the uh our increased understanding of these icy moons in our solar system and things like that um how far off is our ability to examine um moons of exoplanets given like a small enough star or something like that or is that just like so far off from reality given their technological abilities at the moment I would say it's it's far off unfortunate like yeah the problem is that you have to like detect the planet and then the moon going around the planet and it's they're just really hard to find and they'll be even harder to observe which is unfortunate because I bet xomoons are really cool and that would also deal with the tidal locking problem like like if an axumun was orbiting tidally locked Planet the moon will not be tidally locked to the star so it could have day night cycles but they're just really hard to observe yeah thanks for that that would be really cool thank you for the talk everything well thank you [Applause] okay our next speaker is Zachary Fred from MIT thank you hello can everyone hear me so my name's Zach and I'm really excited today to present on some of the work I've done so far during my PhD which is mostly looking into machine learning of the chemical inventory and rare isotopologues of the protostellar source IRAs excuse me 16293 2422b so first of all Let me give just a very high level overview of what supervised machine learning for regression is so the overall goal in this process is to learn a set of model parameters that can be best used to map some input features some X values to some relevant properties some y values just the simplest and oversimplified possible example of this process is just 2D linear regressions something that could be modeled by y equals MX plus b and what you do in this process is you provide the model with training data in the form of X Y Pairs and what it does is it learns the model parameters in this case the m and the B that can best map those inputs to those outputs in a way that minimizes some sort of loss function and while this is a very oversimplified view of this whole approach it can also be very effective for high dimensional inputs and also include very complex non linear models as well so now getting into the problem that I'm trying to tackle with this approach so the overarching goal behind most the work I've done so far is suggesting likely molecular candidates for detection in various regions of space so let's first take a step back and ask the question why do we even care about Interstellar molecules so because we're looking all the way out in space we're not fortunate to be able to throw a thermometer and a reaction Beaker easily observe some sort of physical change during a reaction instead in order to trace the physical properties and evolutionary history of interstellar sources we oftentimes rely on the molecules that we detect along with the properties of said molecules and just a couple of examples D to H ratios provide information about the temperatures of the environments during molecular formation and the detection of sio can trace things like Stellar outflows or shocks so in the past if we wanted to model molecular abundances and use us to predict new molecules for detection we relied heavily on astrochemical models and these as can be seen on the screen are vast networks of interconnected reactions each reaction having its own rate constant and ultimately they can be used to derive the time dependent molecular abundances of these species and while these are excellent tools to gauge our current understanding of the specific chemical processes in space there's a couple of drawbacks first of all in order to add a new molecule or reaction to the network we oftentimes rely very heavily on chemical intuition additionally the rate constants that are inputted into the networks are oftentimes either extrapolated or approximated and the uncertainty that comes along with this when you propagate it through the whole network can result in some very uncertain or inaccurate modeled abundances and finally it's just difficult to include new molecules in order to add a new molecule to the network you have to include every single reaction and I could create the molecule as well as everyone that could subsequently destroy it so that's a difficult and often times inefficient process so in response to these predictive shortcomings uh previous postdoc in our group Dr Kelvin Lee developed a machine learning method that's able to predict and model molecular abundances in space without requiring these complete networks and instead molecular abundances are expressed purely in terms of a chemical Vector space so in this process the first step is you need to collect telescope data toward a specific Interstellar source from this line survey you'll be able to decipher which molecules are present along with the abundances or column densities of said molecules following this for any machine learning application you need to vectorize your input so we have to make molecular feature vectors out of the molecules we're detecting to do this we utilize the multivac algorithm which is an unsupervised algorithm that creates context aware substructure Vector representations that can be subsequently summed to form molecular feature vectors so at this point we have our molecular feature vectors our inputs as well as our relevant column densities our outputs and what we do as mentioned previously we input this into a machine learning model that learns the best way the model parameters to map those molecular features to the relevant column densities and this is just a figure from the initial paper and what it shows is that a very simple right regularize linear regression machine learning method a ridge regression model is able to far out compete even the state of the art Gotham Nautilus astrochemical model in reproducing and predicting the chemical abundances in the tmc 1 dark molecular cloud so while kelvin's initial work was a fantastic proof of concept that this method can in fact effectively model and predict molecular abundances in space there's a number of things that just remain simply untested first of all untested outside of dark molecular cloud so the initial work was focused on the tmc1 dark molecular cloud chemical inventory and this is a very cold and quiescent region of interstellar space so we also want to ensure that these same methods can also apply to warmer more turbulent protostar sources and for this we looked at the class 0 protostar binary IRAs 16293 B this is an especially attractive Source because it has a very dense molecular line survey and it's been studied extensively with interferometric data it's also vital that we can model the abundances in both these cold dark clouds and the warmer protostellar sources because understanding the chemical inventories of these two different sources allows us to investigate how the chemistry actually evolves as a star is forming additionally in part due to the shortcomings of the multivac algorithm there were initially no isotopologues included in the data set however ira6 and 293b consistently shows very high levels of isotopic substitution as a result in order to fill out the data set we felt the need to include these molecules additionally as mentioned previously isotopologues provide information about the temperatures and time scales of molecular formation in space and therefore being able to model these ratios effectively with this machine learning method would provide a straightforward and efficient way to gain additional astrochemical Insight so in order to include these isotopologues we added hand picked isotope descriptors at the end of our multivac representations and more specifically we added 19 extra Vector Dimensions that denoted which specific minor Isotopes are substituted into the molecule along with the chemical environment of said isotopic substitution so just as an example three of the vector Dimensions denote whether the 13 carbon is sp sb2 or sp3 hybridized and we chose this feature because as you can see it has a notable impact on the mean 12C to 13c ratio of the molecules in this source so now getting into some results we train both a gaussian process regression and Bayesian Ridge regression model to map the molecular features of the column densities and what we're ultimately able to see is that the models are able to both effectively model the molecules provided to it in the training set but also extrapolate quite well to yet unseen molecules in the testing set additionally because we included isotope logs in our data set we wanted to see how well these models were able to reproduce the column densities and isotopic ratios of the molecules in the source so what you can see on the top row of the deuterium and 13c substituted isotopolog the using five fold cross validation the column band these are very accurately modeled once you extrapolate this out to actual isotopic ratio predictions these are much more sensitive to small changes in column densities as a result a small error in the column density prediction can result in a large isotopic ratio error so the bottom row of actual isotopic ratios is slightly less precise however just because of how nuanced the process of isotopic fractionation is in space and how simple our encoding is we're very encouraged by these results that we're able to very accurately model the column densities of these isotopically substituted species so as mentioned previously due to the strong performance on the testing set we have some sort of confidence that these models can extrapolate to yet unseen species and as a result we proceeded to input about 90 000 astrochemically relevant molecules into the train models to see which undetected species are likely the most abundant in this source and on the bar chart on the screen you can see the top 10 predicted abundance molecules toward IRS 6 and 293 B and there's two things to point out here first of all three of these molecules namely hydrogen peroxide ethane and carbon dioxide have all been previously detected in different regions of space additionally something you may notice in the bar chart is that many of these molecules are very oxygenated and fairly saturated hydrocarbons and this is also a good sign because when looking at the actual chemical inventory of these sources or this specific Source sorry the most abundant detected molecules are also these very oxygenated hydrocarbons so not only is it learning to predict known Interstellar molecules but at the same time it's narrowing down to the correct region of chemical space relevant to this source so as I mentioned these 10 molecules have not been previously detected in this source and the reason for that in many cases is just simply a lack of rotational Spectra being taken in the lab so now next steps is we want to take that next step forward and collect the rotational Spectra of some of these predicted high abundance molecules that they can be searched for in these protestalar sources one of particular interest is circled on the screen methoxy ethanol and methoxyethanol is in the same chemical family as both methoxy methanol and methoxyethane which have been detected in high abundance toward IRS 16 293 B but not only is this molecule chemically similar to several that have been seen before but we also have some sort of mechanistic reason to believe it may be present so methoxy methanol has been shown to form via reaction of the ch3o the methoxy radical with ch2oh on grain services so the high abundance of methoxymethanol also suggests that in the pre stellar phase of the source that the methoxy radical was highly abundant on these grain services as a result it could feasibly react with the other high abundance organic radicals in this source and we therefore believe that the methoxylated versions of these high abundance Organics in this Source may be strong targets for astrochemical study so next step is to use chirp pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy to study the rotational spectrum of this molecule subsequently use the laboratory Spectrum to search for this molecule in various protestalar sources and upon its detection learn more about the chemistry of this highly abundant masoxy radical so that's all the work I've done so far as well as what I'm working towards I'd like to say a big thank you to my group shown on the screen the picture on the right is just in the green Bank telescope which is a very cool experience I definitely recommend if you have the opportunity to travel there but thank you for listening and I'd be happy to take any questions you may have thank you Zachary so we are running a little behind so I suggest we use the brake and you can find sakuri entering in the break room to ask questions and we'll meet again at 10 30 for the icy World session foreign [Music]

so yeah I'm Sarah Miller I'm working with Professor Brittany Schmidt at Cornell University and I am working to build a global circulation model for the ocean at Europa um so before we move on I wanted to kind of point out the cover image I chose which is primarily because I thought the colors made for a pretty PowerPoint theme and secondarily because it shows some interesting kind of structures that exist on the ice crust on Europa so as you can see it's not a smooth ice skating rink it's a very interesting and geologically active Zone which hints that probably the interior is a dynamic and very interesting place to study which is what I'm going to talk about next before I dive into the science I do want to take a moment to thank my team and kind of the people who have helped me bring my understanding um in this field up so I have a background in fluid dynamics and aerospace engineering which I'll talk a little bit about throughout this talk but these people have been really instrumental in kind of working with me on the planetary aspect as well as my funding sources through an NSF grfp and a NASA finest and an Amelia Earhart fellowship and some wonderful people who support this work okay so as I mentioned uh Europa has a very interesting surface and it hints that there is a dynamic ocean interior and I think that the ocean circulation the physical oceanography piece of this puzzle is a really interesting one in terms of habitability because when we look at Earth's ocean um the transport of heat and salt and nutrients throughout the ocean column is really what sustains our biosphere so I think it has really interesting habitability implications on other planets as well and specifically I want to narrow this down even further the region of our ocean that separates the glacial glacially covered parts of our ocean from the liquid layer that ice ocean boundary layer is really instrumental in setting far field ocean properties so that tiny boundary layer region between the ice and the ocean actually has an outsized effect on affecting Global Mass Water mass transport and so I think that's very much worthy of intense study in the modeling realm for Europa so I'm not the first person to attempt to build a global circulation model for Europa um but the the state of the field is really kind of Divergent so um models of Europa generally fall into one of two categories depending on kind of how you set your boundary conditions and really how you set up this ice ocean interface mathematically so usually there's kind of an outsized effect of either the rotation driven or buoyancy driven so kind of temperature salinity gradients in the model and the results are very different so Global circulation models exist they usually fall into one of these two categories and they do not agree with each other now if we look at terrestrial Ocean Models on the other hand they look very different and that's because they've had a lot more scientific Manpower in years of study and actual data so how nice for them so their models are very sophisticated compared to what we see in planetary Ocean Models that being said there are still kind of parts of Earth's ocean that we don't understand so it's very much ocean modeling is an active area of research and there's still some mechanisms that remain poorly constrained which is really humbling to think about doing this on a body that we have zero data for and know a lot less about but I'm going to try anyway um so let me introduce you to the tool that I'm using so I'm using the MIT General circulation model so it's a 3D circulation model that employs the full non hydrostatic incompressible navier Stokes equations it also has some really interesting and very useful packages for Europa so an ice shelf package um a deep convection package which is really helpful because Europa unlike Earth has a really deep ocean compared to its planetary radius and that is important when you're talking about large scale flow features so I won't kind of dive into the nitty gritty it's written in Fortran so if you're a modeler you're probably just cringed uh but yeah it's a it's a very powerful very useful tool so there's lots of knobs that you can turn within this model and I'm working on turning kind of all of these through sensitivity studies throughout my PhD but what I want to focus on in this talk is the role of topography underneath the ice shelf so in this case I'm talking about both the small scale topography so surfness roughness surface roughness of the ice which affects things like turbulence in the boundary layer as well as large scale features on the ice that can form large scale flow features now you might be thinking like why would a turbulent boundary layer affect global ocean circulation and specifically habitability for this interest and I want you to remember that the ocean time scales operate a lot faster than planetary time scales and that could be an important link for a habitability argument so a quick review of kind of boundary layer of physics um I took out the full equations because they're pretty ugly and I just have these like nice kind of simplified relationships that I want to discuss um so I'm using kind of a widely adopted parameterization called the three equation parameterization it's very creatively named and essentially it's just looking at this fluxes those are those Q values between a solid ice shelf which is fresh water or fresh ice a mixed boundary layer region and then the mixed layer the liquid ocean so we're looking at kind of the three unknowns in these equations are the temperature and salinity of the boundary layer as well as a melt rate or MDOT which is negative if it's melting positive if it's freezing and that's kind of how we're constraining the phase change that's happening at this region so I'm using a model that's um kind of an ongoing International effort within the MIT GCM Community to uh model this kind of physics um for Earth's ocean and so this is a simplified version of that map so it's a two equation parameterization that's assuming the salinity of the boundary layer and the mixed layer is the same um current research and kind of more recent results since submitting this abstract I've been able to like use the three equation parameterization but those graphs are still pretty ugly so maybe next at gradcon um yeah and kind of one other thing that's very common on Earth but not a great approximation for Europa is that often in Ocean Models the pressure dependence of density is approximated by depth dependence I mentioned that europa's ocean is a lot deeper than Earth's so this is something that I've removed as well because I think no longer holds for europa's ocean um so I mentioned it's probably not like a flat ice skating rink under europa's eye shell we don't know what it looks like but it's probably not that beautiful and simple um it's probably not this beautiful and simple either but to start with to kind of demonstrate some of the flow features that might develop with ice shelf topography here's like a very simple ramp that I'm introducing so it's not a global model quite yet it's just a rectangular domain starting at a fixed initial temperature um and we're going to introduce a heat gradient and a flow through ice melting and see what develops so we're seeing some already just with very simple geometry interesting and kind of recognizable flow features so we see the development of what looks kind of like a western boundary current on the left and an ocean gyre on the right and these are happening because there is melting happening at depth so if you remember the phase diagram of water there is a pressure dependence on the melting point of ice and so we see melting happening on the bottom of this ramp and then as the fresh waters Rising along the Melt water the ramp it's circulating and that's creating a circular flow feature this dryer so we have on the left these are just stream functions the barotropic stream function and then the right and overturning stream function just in a couple different directions so maybe more importantly uh the Melt rate what's happening so we're seeing both regions of melting and freezing The Contours got a little dense for the melting so I just kind of outlined that where that's happening there but that's happening um kind of as the warmer Ocean mixed layer water is interacting with this Frozen ramp and so we see that kind of um already just very simple geometry there's lots of Dynamics happening there's freezing there's melting there's flow features um but this is probably not very realistic maybe more realistic is something like this so this is a almost Global um topography that I stole from what Earth's ice shelves look like I could have the poles because of convergence issues and it's a pretty coarse resolution but it still captures a lot of the large scale flow features that we see on Earth as well as some turbulence and mixing events effects from small scale features that are missing and so I think it's really important to think that like when you're modeling um heat transfer like your grid resolution is really important so the size of your grid cell in your model affects kind of how quickly heat is transferred through your ocean and so this is really too course to understand um what's happening in turbulence and Boundary layer effects so I'm kind of accommodating that in the model by modifying the MIT GCM to have like spatial grid remeshing so I'm slicing up the grid cells so that I can have melting and freezing happening within a single model run which is not kind of the standard configuration within the boundary layer so this has been kind of very helpful in understanding um turbulence and more quick time scale melting and freezing physics now this is kind of one of several things that needs to happen to have a more realistic ice shells like greater spatial grid density in the boundary layer um there's also but even so you know it's not going to be a simple ramp um there's other things to introduce like salt different heat and salt transfer coefficients um a mushy layer there's interesting work that's being done by this on this by Jacob buffo if you want to look at his work um so in my model currently the ice is assumed as a completely fresh water layer that's probably not the case there might be zones of brines and interesting kind of pockets of heterogeneities that will affect these processes but this is kind of all just taking steps to like introduce more realistic features into an ice shell model and then look at the global circulation effects of those features so kind of to kind of wrap up this little bit that I've discussed um terrestrial models I think can be very valuable in the planetary Community within those models specifically I think there still needs to be a lot of work done on the ice ocean boundary layer which is what I've been focusing on this past year of my PhD and the potential impacts for habitability of this kind of great resolution on an ISO student boundary layer could be very important for habitability all right and I'm happy to take questions [Applause] so if you are assuming uh so with the mushy layer you know like a slurry for instance is the Assumption of uh incompressible fluid still valid and does that change that makes never Stokes much more complicated right so how would that really affect the your modeling would you have to change some things or yeah no that's a really good question so um realistically yes you would change uh the kind of forcing equations so the model as it currently runs it assumes that um kind of backing up a little bit the equation of state of seawater is a linear function of salinity so if you introduce something like a brine it's removing that kind of linear assumption that said like the model as it currently stands it does have a solid ice layer so it doesn't look at brine Pockets or mushy layers yet um if you wanted to do that I do think that yeah you'd need to change the equation of State at seawater locally yeah to accommodate those and what about the incompressibility assumption I think that's a small enough one where if you're looking at the effects on overturning in flow it wouldn't have an effect but it would be a very cool sensitivity study so it's a good question thank you thank you sorry a really ignorant question so Europa it seems like there's a very kind of noticeable temperature gradient is that just due to pressure like what's the middle of Europa oh interesting question okay I think I have um a backup slide that might help so yeah so the mechanisms that are kind of important for Europa Heating and what's sustaining the ocean are like tidal heating that it have bottom heating from residual heat of formation internal heat if there is this Dynamic eye shell that's freezing and melting like I think it is then you have heat fluxes from freezing and melting um yeah so there's a lot going on um the kind of Weights of these effects is still very much unknown and so that's why I'm really trying to use observations from Earth so for instance I'm using like turbulent turbulent transfer coefficients of freezing and melting from Antarctic field studies to kind of influence this model but yeah it's really like there's a lot going on so it's really kind of the challenge is trying to figure out which one is driving um yeah the thermal gradient thanks yeah we have time for one more question Taylor planner at Georgia Tech great talk Sarah um you were talking about Brian Pockets to like make it the model more realistic did you have do you plan on doing that with your model and have they done it on earth like with like Earth models have they even thought of like incorporating bride pockets yeah it's a good question so the answer is like no most um like glacial models and Earth Global ocean circulation models don't include brine Pockets because on Earth those are more seen in like Lake environments or kind of like the like hyper saline lakes and Flash bows and lakes that like Jacob works on um they might Europe as a yeah different conditions though um and so they could exist there so at most I think I would do a like a case study on what would happen if Brian pocket Pockets exist so it's something I'm working on now um but it's not something I'd include in every run because it's just still very much an unknown yeah I was going to say that was kind of like a loaded question but I was curious no it's a good question yeah thank you so much for the toxic thank you okay our next speaker is Sam nesraldine from the University of Arizona hello pleasure to be here uh so I'm in the program in Applied Mathematics at the University of Arizona um but I work with Professor Regis farrier who's an ecologist and uh postdoc antenna affolder who is also an ecologist and a planetary scientist um so we developed these Global models of Europa and so what you see right here is the Euro Europa Clipper Mission which is going to launch next year in October hopefully and I believe it's the largest in terms of size spacecraft that NASA's ever built because of those massive solar panels um because we're when we're five times away from the Sun at Jupiter I think the brightness scales like inverse Square law so 25 times less bright at that area so why do we care about Europa so beneath the ice crust we have an ocean which potentially contains two to three times the amount of water as on Earth which is when I first discovered that fact I was just so blown away by that um and we have an energy source from tidal heating namely we may have hydrothermal venting as a result of that we saw that on Enceladus because we saw silicates in the plumes we haven't confirmed that yet in Europa but it's very likely based on the amount of tidal energy that we expect um and we also have a rock ocean interface so that's very essential for you know cycling chemicals needed for life uh and we have a lot of convection as Sarah talked about um which is very essential also for those energy gradients so as a result we need these models to constrain what we're going to see from the mission so we had juice also the esa Mission let's not forget about that um uh so we need to model all these different layers um so working off what we did for install it is to analyze the Cassini data we're going to do that here specifically focusing on the ecosystem aspect and so what we want to do with that is provide clear constraints on what kind of biosynitaries we're going to expect based on a number of different hypotheses of abiotic possibilities biotic possibilities and habitable possibilities without life so as I said our approach is very multi level uh we are going to first look at the bottom layer which is the mixing of the core in the ocean uh to assess you know the chemical structure coming out of you know coming out through through the water passing through the core uh and what chemicals are going to come through that we're going to have to assess what how that mixes in the water to assess how much uh chemicals we're going to see coming out of the plumes and then we also need to take some model organisms from Earth to understand the metabolisms that we might expect along with the ecological and possible evolutionary dynamics of the life that we're modeling so with this framework we're going to estimate the likelihoods of certain data sets that we're going to see via a Bayesian framework so to intimidate you a little bit we're going to have some math um so let's talk about the mixing we look at the dimensionless mixing ratio X and the temperature T so we have a partial differential equation which with spatial and time variables solving this partial differential equation gives us this steady state composition and temperature of the mixing layer with the mass flux density so using that information we can compute what we're going to see coming out of the plumes by integrating over the entire space uh so we we integrate the integrand contains this Mass flux density and the concentration of a specific chemical component that we're looking at so whether that be a glycine or other amino acids or you know cells potentially so the concentration of this compound at the base of the ocean plume assuming that the buoyant mixing layer mixes together as we described from the previous model is given by this quotient of these integrals so then we want to look at the cell metabolism and output and there's a very large variety of possibilities we could be working with here so we kind of run the model for tons and tons of possibilities of Earth analogs depending on these environmental conditions so we model this catabolic reaction rate of a specific organism using the Arrhenius law I know that came up yesterday Arrhenius in one of the trivia questions um uh so and that's so the Arrhenius lie is specifically this quotient here and we use the catabolic energy constant for given by this term and it goes in here to understand the ratio of inactivated to activated enzymes for the reaction now critically we assess the ecological dynamics of the system so in this case we are dealing with one population which is given by a standard ode model describing the Dynamics but we've been thinking about incorporating multi species into this because there's actually a significant dynamical difference when you have competition between species in the environment and that would seriously affect what we'll see when we go there so we have to we have to have multiple different ecosystem Dynamics models and so we solve this and get a steady state concentration of a specific uh compound from this so what can we learn from specifically the Europa Clipper Mission uh so the Europa Clipper Mission has some very interesting instruments we have a mapping Imaging spectrometer so it will map the surface and conduct the spectroscopy of the surface and the distribution of the Organics so as things come out of the plumes they'll they fall onto the surface and we should expect to see an interesting chemical composition I know they're already doing this with jwst from the from a distance they haven't analyzed that data yet but uh should be interesting and then to sort of sniff the exosphere of Europa we have a mass spectrometer Mass specs it'll determine the the composition of the of the ocean beneath by sniffing that exosphere and then we have a surface dust analyzer uh it'll have it'll measure like the solid particles coming out and so in this image you can see kind of a remote identification of NaCl via spectroscopy so let's focus on this slide a little bit so this is the overall framework so at the top we have those mechanistic models for the geochemistry and the biology that we discussed earlier and so the flow of information goes from the top as prior probability probability densities that flow into s parameters into the general model then we pass those parameters into the biological model for physiology and evolution which then goes to our habitability Criterion so the habitability Criterion that we generally use here is it's a differential equation describing the population so essentially if I were to take an Earth like organism drop it onto Europa would the change in the population be positive or would it be zero so the derivative of population growth essentially and so we pass that into Bayes theorem as prior distributions the posterior distributions uh come from these uh so we okay actually to be more specific we simulate all of these models with thousands of data points to get what we call pseudo data uh in what's called an approximate Bayesian computation and so we pass that into the model and we take the observational data and we put that into base theorem so if any of you are aware of Bayes theorem that is a way of assessing the probability of a certain event given prior information given posterior information um and so now we have this cycle of information so after we get a probability from base theorem we can pass it back into the geophysical parameters model and then continue to constrain as we get more observational data so here's an example of how we did that with Enceladus for Cassini so in this graph here you can see the blue dots are simulations for uninhabitable parameter space the orange dots are uninhabited but habitable and the green dots are habitable and habited so what you can see from analyzing the methane content of the plume and Cassini using this framework was that the vast majority of simulations for all the possibilities we assessed fall under the biotic category um which is pretty exciting because I mean that speaks for itself right so um but there's a very important constraint on this namely the probability of a by Genesis so what we do in this model is assess all the possibilities from probability zero to probability one of abiogenesis and so what we found was at a pretty low probability of abiogenesis uh the from the previous slide um with a low probability of a biogenesis you see that biotic explanations are the most probable for what we're seeing the in the methane content so we really need to develop our models of abiogenesis to really limit limit this variable and constrain this probability so the conclusion is in order to find life we really have to model these planetary systems with the assumption that there could be life there already because if we don't we're going to show up there and we're going to think okay it's habitable but why because potentially the habitability of a planet is actually coming from the life is already there so we have to incorporate that into our into our potential models so this will allow us to really enhance Mission data analysis beforehand uh so you know with when we had Cassini we showed up there and we had no idea what was going on we're like wild plumes this is amazing um but it took many many years to really assess this so hopefully with Europa Clipper we have this framework in hand as a software package so the data can be fed through real time and the benefit of this is then we can narrow down in on specific areas of Europa that are of interest to us and really maximize the scientific yield of these missions so without take questions and thank you uh nice talk uh two questions maybe the first did you choose a prior for a biogenesis yeah so we sampled the entire space from zero to one probability in that in those 10 000 or so simulations so basically um we can't pick a prior for abiogenesis there's no constraint on that variable so essentially we have to run the model for all possibilities of abiogenesis so so like I said specifically with the Enceladus data we found that uh much less than 50 chance abiogenesis ensures that the biotic explanation is the most probable explanation I believe is around 30 or less probability but if you're beneath that threshold then really the abiotic explanations are way more probable even though the samples from the abiotic simulations are much smaller but you know when the probability of evangelists is really low it's just not going to happen right so I've got that answered my second question great hey thank you for your talk so for Europa are you also in terms of metabolism are you thinking about methanogenesis or yeah okay so that was the first step to consider um in for Enceladus it was kind of a the most obvious thing to look at because of the methane content um with Europa it's more complex uh because we don't have any real data from Europa and also the environments on Europa are much more varied you have subsurface pockets of water along with the ocean and maybe you have like biofilms on the bottom of the eye so it's it's a much more complex thing um so my hope is to uh run all the simulations for all the possible hypotheses that exist currently okay and I have one little follow up question so you very briefly talked about Dynamic communities and you mentioned competition are you just looking at competition or are you looking at other sorts of consortiums like in a biofilm there's competition but there's also lots of sharing going on right so um if we're including multi species in our models we're hoping to incorporate all the possible interactions between these species um which is really critical I want to re re uh iterate because you know the competition can kill off like all of the life you know so we need to sort of have an evolutionary perspective also and not just like a real time ecological perspective to assess these things um so really good question thank you very quick questions hi Emily bear Stanford University I was wondering so in the biological part of the model what kind of data goes into that and how can environmental microbiologists help modelers improve their models what kind of data do you need for that right so we need Earth analogs primarily we need the you know catabolic reaction parameters for specific Earth analog so you know we might want to go to Antarctica and see what's going on there um and that's our best that's our best way to constrain it at the moment so that's how I think biologists really should really help us in that way yeah exactly thank you so much for your thoughts thank you our next Pico speaker is Pavel Clair from NASA amps hi everyone um I'm just going to make a quick note before we start that it's great to be an astrobiology conference because the background slides are going to go much more smoothly um I presented this in a microscopy conference a few months back and it was a different experience um so thank you all for being here um and being you um so um I'm gonna talk uh this is going to be a little bit of a pivot from some of the previous talks but I'm going to talk um about uh some of the methods that I've been working on to actually detect life on a mission a life detection mission to Europa or Enceladus I'm also going to make a note so I'm going to be talking about uh a life life detection missions to Europa and Enceladus as a target for this but um once you have a space capable microscope this could potentially be applied to like all sorts of destinations there's lots of fun possibilities here the aforementioned background slides so um when we're picking destinations to look for life um there's uh we like to look for places that have habitable conditions things that have liquid water abundant energy sources and conditions that are suitable for uh Life as we know it or as we might predict it may exist and um I'm just going to let Enceladus and Europa sit up there because we've already heard a lot of justifications as to why those are promising targets to find those conditions and why we might have had um an uh origin of life or living organisms currently there um but when we're searching for life we also have to think about how we're actually going to look for it and so um we can kind of break down life into some of the key components that make it up things like uh catalysts that help it uh metabolize um things like information storage polymers so DNA or RNA and earth based life of them look very different for extraterrestrial life um and also compartments life on on Earth Life as we know it loves to put things inside of membranes and then sometimes they put those membranes inside other membranes and have them connect to other even more membranes but those that packaging really helps it do some interesting chemistry um and so when we're then thinking about this in the context of a mission um we can start to think about how we might actually observe that and what analytical approaches we need to take to try and get at that um and so I put the like giant table up here um because uh these are all things that people are working on um for Life detection instrumentation but we're going to be focusing for this talk on containers um and so um the reason for that is um that again as mentioned life loves to package things into compartments and those compartments can be directly observable by using a microscope to look for morphology and also for the collocalization of certain key chemical biomarkers um so in um our team we're working on um a microscopy system that we call a luminescence imager for exploration or life um and there is uh two key hardware components of this system one is the fluidic subsystem and this is to deal with um the actual sample processing and preparation for Imaging something so um my background full disclosure is actually not an astrobiology it's in fluorescence microscopy and um you know I spent like five or six years in grad school just moving fluids around in tubes and like preparing things on slides before they actually get to the microscope I've been told it would be expensive to send me to Enceladus so uh this is this is my replacement um and then the other end is the actual microscope itself so the optic system which is going to have all of the things that you need to actually take your pretty pictures um so I'm gonna break down what goes into these systems a little bit so the fluidic subsystem that uh like uh silver plate on top um is the rotary filter stage and so the um the stage can do seven individual experiments um and so that accounts for originally this was designed with the Europa Lander Mission Concept in mind where there would be three separate samples each with a replicate and then a procedural blank and then each of those individually has um three uh filters of different sizes um and so uh that basically will let you sort out particles so the filters are 10 microns 1.2 microns and uh 0.2 microns in size and that's just so you don't end up with larger particles obscuring any of the smaller particles that you're trying to image in your sample um and that way you're not missing any of the like good stuff that might be there um there you use all it's also attached to the fluidix manifold which is the part that actually moves all of the liquids and fluids around and it also has a lot of sensors for pressure pH conductivity and also crucially some storage for the fluorescent stains that I'm going to be talking about a little bit later in the talk um and then these were the filters that I mentioned earlier and so uh this is again for sample size sorting but they're also made of a silicon nitrate substrate that has a low fluorescence background um and this whole system has passed Environmental Testing so um one thing about microscopes and also uh you know fluid fluidix has a fair bit of space flight Heritage but in general Hardware uh can break and I'm sure everyone who's worked in the lab is dealt with a lot of like issues before so you want to make sure these things are robust and you can actually get it to where you want to launch it to um the optic subsystem is a nice small compact box and so um this is a 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter by 13 centimeter Cube I have an image on my phone that I didn't upload to the presentation because the image quality is not that good but for context that's uh about as tall as a banana which is very small for like a benchtop fluorescence microscope um there is like fancier microscopes can sometimes be like the size of of a person if you're trying to do crazy like two Photon lifetime Imaging or something but even an Epi fluorescent scope would probably occupy like this Podium normally and there'd be a lot of like miscellaneous kind of assorted parts so it's a really nice little system and so that contains all of the excitation LEDs emission filters all the Optics um and so uh this table is just kind of going through what the different uh bits of Hardware that we have are and um to kind of like give the the the high level Summary of why this is relevant um basically we have three LEDs that are common excitation wavelengths for different fluorescent stains that can also excite different types of autofluorescence and then um one thing that's actually relatively unique to this microscope certainly no microscopes I've worked with previously I've had this is the 275 nanometer LED so that's actually fairly far in the ultraviolet range um and that's really good at exciting uh protein fluorescence so uh tryptophan phenylalanine the various aromatic amino acid side chains actually fluoresce quite brightly in the ultraviolet and so that can help image native fluorescent of samples and also excite the fluorescence of many different kinds of minerals um the objective is also set up to help uh well it's robust to space flight but also the part that I think is super fun is that it most objectives actually can't collect light in that ultraviolet range um so it is a custom objective that's built for those sorts of experiments um it has a Piezo stage that lets us do automated Z stacking um and this is also been subjected to environmental and shock and vibrational testing and also radiation testing um to the specifications of the Europa Lander mission so um we're now on our ongoing work is actually characterizing this microscope by Imaging different types of samples to see what the the the limits are of what we can detect so um this sample is just kind of showing uh some of the bright some bright field images from a sample that was collected from Lake undersea in Antarctica and so um I'm showing here the 10 Micron and 1.2 Micron filters to kind of highlight that um we can image the the objects at um of very different sizes and you can see the the physical uh size of the little uh holes there um and so if we were to just put this all onto one filter that microbial matte looking thing on the the year left um would probably obscure some of the smaller objects that we're seeing in the other filter sizes um and so um as I mentioned earlier we can also excite native fluorescence and so we can correlate this as well with the bright field images so we can take an image of an object say oh hey that looks interesting I wonder what that is look at the you know native fluorescence in different ranges and get a sense of okay wait we've got a bunch of like Organics that are fluorescent in the UV range that are all localized on this object that's pretty exciting um and then we can also then stain the sample with fluorescent stains to look for more specific chemical signatures um and so in this case I'm showing the same sample after it's been treated with a stain for primary amines and another one that stains lipids and so we can look for both the presence of those molecules but also their co localization in space and this is a really like unique and Powerful kind of data that you can get from the microscope is not just like what compounds are there but seeing that they're associating with each other kind of gives you a good piece of evidence that you might be seeing some disequilibrium and some living structures um microscopy data is also large um maybe not as large as some of the types of data that we've talked about in this conference so far but certainly large enough that if you were trying to send all of this data back from Europa or Enceladus it would be more complicated to handle and so one of the things that we're able to do on this microscope is actually take a z stack of of images and compress it down to a single image that's much less in data volume and so the image I'm showing right now is um an image set of images that were automatically collected at different focal planes in the sample um and then after it's run through the compression routine you end up with a single in Focus image and you're now suddenly gone from megabytes of data to kilobytes of data um and then um you can even go further with that and you'll notice that this sample has uh bright objects against a dark background we don't actually care what the like Photon shot noise is on the background for our purposes that might as well just all be zero and so the final compression step is actually taking that and setting it to zero and so we're just recording um the actual bright objects that are detected in the image and so that all reduces the data size quite substantially um without really getting rid of any of the information that we actually want to take out of that sample um so how would this work in in a mission I just talked about a lot of different parts and now I'm going to bring it all back together into how this system could be implemented um so and I have the little Europa Lander picture there um but basically uh we pretend that the microscope is somewhere in that Lander um you would take your sample process it pump it through the fluidic system you can image it on the microscope um you're going to end up with megabytes of data that you can then compress back down to your kilobytes of data send it back to your ground based Observer that will then be able to say oh okay cool we got a microbial mat on Europa time to hit the Press um and so uh yeah just briefly acknowledgments there's been a lot of funding that's gone into this um and um I'll be happy to take any questions [Applause] great talk uh this is Chad pazoriski at Georgia Tech so um I'm really happy that you touched on uh compression first of all uh of the data because that's incredibly important and um I was also really thrilled that you talked about the um sample prep and fluidics because I think that's something that a lot of people don't consider for these NCG missions uh my question has to do with um comparing uh microscopy and staining with uh perhaps something like Raman or IR where you could get information about at least functional groups of the Organics present and co locate things that I imagine similar resolution spatially but you wouldn't need to include those processing steps so would you advocate for a system that's I guess maybe not redundant but but has both of those features or do you think one is better than the other yes this is actually a super interesting discussion and we can definitely also talk more about it at lunch but the the high level thing that I'm going to say is that um you you get you're going to have different pros and cons and get different types of data those techniques so if you're doing let's if you want to get spatially correlated Ramen data when you're building a microscope and you're trying to image something unless you're using a super resolution technique you're limited by diffraction in terms of like the the resolution that you can get and that is proportional to the wavelength that you're using so when you start to get into like the IR you know range and things like that your spatial resolution starts to be more limited than it is in the optical range the flip side is you're right you can get precise chemical information out without um you know adding labels and so I think that definitely those are like in in in in the perfect mission architecture I think you do both um you know and um unfortunate you know it's it's it's unfortunate that we can't send all the instruments that we want out there but like in my ideal world I think those that would be a powerful like correlative technique there um to kind of get a a strong sense of what you're seeing in your sample um but yeah great question thanks foreign again thanks for an awesome talk this is really exciting so I was wondering what sample prep looks like um in the Rover or whatever and um what the capabilities are for that so could you actually do like incubation experiments and then look at it with microscopy or is it coming straight from the environment going straight to the microscope yeah so um it's the the the design that we had in mind for for sample prep here and when I said I say we it's not um us this was kind of the built around the Europa Lander specifications but essentially you'd have a sample cup that would collect an ice sample and melt it down and so that was kind of the um initial like thoughts behind the design here but the fluidics processing system can basically handle anything that's in a liquid state but the assumption would be that it's a relatively unprocessed field sample um relatively unprocessed because obviously if it's like ice or something and you're melting it down you are still doing something to that sample um thanks okay we have time for one more question I thank you for the great talk um my question is uh maybe I missed that you mentioned how are you going to differentiate uh any other particles um from the living materials like can you specifically staying genetic material or anything biological yeah so that's actually that's a great question and um so the the the the goal here is to kind of pick up as many different breadcrumbs as you as as we can to try and uh differentiate and so you mentioned stains for genetic material one of the stains that we would be launching with this is a stain for nucleic acids um now obviously that would be really awesome if we found DNA on Europa or Enceladus but um there's it's kind of an open question whether we would um and um so the idea behind looking for the something like the co localization of amines and lipids is that that gives you a more like agnostic idea of like hey that might be living material because you've got these you know chemical signatures that are co locating um the other thing is um so one of our um collaborators actually the person who helped build the microscope um is has some ongoing work characterizing the fluorescence of uh diff of the wide library of minerals to get a sense of like what they would potentially look like um on the the microscope so we can hopefully differentiate between that and things that might be a little bit more biological but spectroscopically and then also you know morphologically um yeah a great question amazing thank you for the talk [Music] our next speaker is Kenneth Seton from JPL hello as Miguel said um my name is Marshall and I'm an NPP fellow at JPL Caltech and I work with Morgan cable and Brianna Henderson and I do most of my experimental work at Caltech and Paul asimov's lab but because this is a conference of literally graduate students and post docs I wanted to talk about the planetary science summer school program which is a program for graduate students and postdocs to teach you all how to help Mission design for planetary missions actually happens and to learn the process and so I'm going to be presenting the mission that my team and I developed during the PSS in which the majority of the framework for the mission was developed back in 2021 and that we iterated on since then the astrobiology exploration at Enceladus or X for short and I'm going to preface this by saying that this is an Unholy amount of information to distill into a dozen slides and so uh I did my best unfortunately I can't go into a lot of detail with these slides but if you have any questions about the science and ask a question if you don't want to ask a question come find me I'd love to be stoked to talk about this stuff Okay so I'm sure you guys are familiar with Enceladus at this point um but that thing is in solidus it's one of uh Saturn's moons and it's it's relatively pretty small it's only about 500 kilometers in diameter but there's some super cool stuff going on even though it's it's this tiny little thing that stuff coming out of the bottom of Enceladus is a continuous plume that's formed over the South polar Terrain and so if we zoom in a little bit closer these are images from Cassini and though it's not actually blue like that that's in false color but that's just to show you where these um fractures are and the plume is sourced from those fractures um that all combines to form a continuous Bloom over the South polar terrain and we have really strong evidence from some of the measurements by Cassini that this plume is directly sourced from a subsurface Global liquid water ocean and so this presents a unique opportunity unique in our solar system to sample the contents of a subsurface ocean in situ using a multi flyby or an Orbiter Mission architecture and we have some rough compositional information of the plume from Cassini using the inms or the ion and neutral Mass spectrometer and the cosmic dust analyzer and so um in the plume gas we see water um Hydra small hydrocarbons some simple and complex Organics and this is a paper from the weight at all paper back in 2006 from the inms data but if we look at plume grains we see that they're waterized but um we see a lot of different salts but in addition to that and I I think a previous talk hit on this a little bit we see silicon Nano grains and that's really important because based on what we know the only way that these silicon nanoparticles could be produced within this size range are high temperature hydrothermal reactions and that's huge from a habitability standpoint and in addition to this um looking at the CDA data that Cosmic dust analyzer we see evidence not direct detection because of the the instrumental capabilities we had at the time this is like 80s technology but we see strong evidence for macromolecular organic compounds and so there's this complex organic chemistry going on that we don't really understand and we don't know what's going on there but like something's happening and so we need to figure out what's up and so with that being said we have liquid water we have a geothermal source of feed via the high temperature hydrothermal reactions essentially all the chemical building blocks for Life as we know it they're present um sulfur hasn't been published yet but it has been detected in the greens it should be published in the next year so so with all of this in mind could Enceladus Harbor life we thought it would be sick to develop a mission concept that would be capable of finding out and so just a brief overview of our mission architecture it's be it multiply by missions where you're orbiting Saturn and do multiple flybysmen zeldas and we would require 30 flybys for our science and would launch in 2033 and after a nine year cruise phase and a one year pump down phase we would enter four years of science operations where we would directly search for biosignatures through nsitu chemical compositional analysis of the plume and contextualize these in situ measurement in situ measurements through a synergistic combination of geophysical and geomorphological investigations aimed at also assessing the habitability of Enceladus over geologic time and we would do this using a mass spectrometer a high resolution camera and just a high gain antenna so three it well two and a half instruments because the antenna you use for radio communications and so just briefly to talk about how before I dive into the science objectives how these objectives were formulated NASA doesn't like as much when people just when they're developing missions to like take this instrument okay we have the sick instrument what kind of science can we do with it instead um we were taught and we were informed that NASA prefers that you first start by answering or by asking questions like what do we not know about Enceladus what do we need to know to ask more questions and so that's what we started by doing and if you do that if you start from the science questions and what you're interested in and what you want to find out the rest of it follows pretty logically and so say we want to find out this thing okay what do we need to measure to figure that thing out okay then you have your measurement requirements and then at what levels do we need to measure this there you have like further established measurement requirements well how do we make these measurements and then you select your instruments and then so on and so forth and so it just logically flows from it's called a left to right approach and so I'll talk a little bit about our science objectives of course the first which is to determine if the molecular and isotopic distributions uh within the plume are a result of biological activity or abiotic chemical processing and we would do this just with your usual suspects amino acids fatty acids and plume grains and um by assessing isotopic fractionation in um in the plume gas and we would do this just using a mass spectrometer and if you have any questions about Mass specs or instrument selection please ask a question or find me later I'd love to talk about that and the second of our objectives is to determine whether Enceladus is in thermal equilibrium and is therefore capable of sustaining an ocean over geologic time scales and this is essentially just a heat balance equation we want to know how much being how much heat is being input to Enceladus through tidal dissipation from Saturn and how much heat is being emitted by Enceladus through like um conductive heat loss and you can actually determine the heat being generated with an Enceladus by uh looking at tidal dissipation from Saturn and you can do this using orbital migration rates so you could look at where Enceladus is at in its orbital phase relative to What was seen by Cassini to see how the orbital migration happens and uh from that you could calculate a tidal dissipation quality factor and you can determine the heat being emitted by measuring ice shell thickness which is a proxy for the heat loss and you can do that using a gravity signs measurements the third of our objective objectives is to looking at plume formation mechanisms to determine whether the plume material is being delivered to the surface via open crevice boiling or explosive cryovolcanic like eruptions and we expect there to be differences in the morphology of the vents at the surface that are expressed in each scenario and you could actually sort of tease out how these plumes are being formed by high resolution imaging of the fence so for an open crevice model we expect there to be vent width variations in response to Tidal forcing throughout enceladus's orbital phase and for an open crevice model we expect these vent width variations to be consistent along the strike of the vent and so by taking multiple high resolution images of a single vent throughout in solidus's orbital phase and looking at vent width variations we can determine if that were the case whereas for a purely cryovolcanic eruptive model we expect these vent width variations to be restricted to the immediate vicinity of the vent and so we could sort of tease out the relative contribution of each of these models to plume formation and then our fourth and final science objective is to determine if the geologic activity that uh is modifying the South polar terrain like we see in all those awesome images uh if it's influenced other regions in the past over geologic time I'm going to do this by uh looking at two things both crater infilling and elliptical crater orientations because if you look at the depth diameter ratios of craters around the South polar terrain they're pretty shallow compared to the rest of the the crater population because of all that plume Fallout that's infilling the craters and so we see really shallow craters around there but if you look at the global crater population like typically um they have a pretty well defined depth diameter ratio and so if we were to look at survey the global crater population and find an area around Enceladus where we see anomalously infilled craters that could be evidence that there was past plume activity and another thing that we would look at uh are elliptical crater orientations to see if there could have been any eye shell reorientation in the past because given a preferential velocity Vector in the impactor population and a small enough impact angle below about 15 degrees elliptical craters are formed and so like given a preferential velocity Vector we expect to see mostly East West um uh oriented elliptical craters and so if we were to survey the crater population and see a shift in the orientation of these elliptical craters that is like relatively consistent we could infer past eye shell reorientation from that and so for the mission trajectory um briefly we would use a Venus Earth Earth Venus Earth Earth Jupiter gravity assist where we would do we do a a slingshot around Venus and then a couple orbits around Earth and then slingshot out to the Jupiter system and then use Jupiter's gravity to slingshot out into the Saturn system but getting out to Saturn isn't a problem it's slowing down that's the problem because you're going like 15 20 kilometers a second and so after Saturn orbital insertion we do a one year pump down phase and using multiple use multiple flybys of Titan using Titan's gravity to reduce the spacecraft velocity and tailor the inclination and altitude such that we could Target and sell at us properly for our flybys and then after that enter a four year tour phase where we would conduct all of our science operations that would consist of 30 flybys at least and this is this uh requirement is driven primarily by our gravity science measurements that we need to make and the surface mapping would require a total of 22 flybys um not necessarily 22 flybys total dedicated surface mapping but the data downlink would require 22 flybys um and so a minimum of five flybys at low altitudes as well for event imagery and Institute Bloom analyzes so keyword to key takeaway uh and solidus is sick it's super awesome there's a lot of really cool stuff going on there and we would see what's going on there by looking at plume composition heat balance the different event formation mechanisms and what the surface of Enceladus can tell us about its past and this is important because in the most recent decadal survey they specifically call out a New Frontiers mission to Enceladus using a multi flyby mission architecture and so there's so many outstanding questions that we just we just don't know about what's going on in Enceladus and we need to go back to figure out what's going on so as promised a little talk about PSS this is my team that I worked with and they're the most absurdly brilliant group of people that I've ever had the pleasure of working with um they're incredible I'm still friends with many of them now um and so I I'd like to talk a little bit about the PSS um it's uh it's not really as much of a summer school as it is a rigorous Mission design program where they teach you how to actually formulate a mission um and the deadlines pass for this year but it's it's it's competitive you have to apply for it and they take 18 people per cohort um but you get to work with literally the best in the business um you're mentored by people that are on like Europa Clipper Mars sample return all that kind of stuff and in the last week you get to work one on one and are mentored by a member of NASA's uh Advanced project design team uh TMax they're literally the best at what they do formulating missions and you've learned so much and it's incredible um if you have any questions please come find me ask here or if you don't want to ask a question in front of a bunch of people come find me talk to me um I knew when I first like was thinking about doing it I was like oh my God I don't know anything about Mission design how am I going to do this but everybody else in my court thought the exact same thing so you don't need to be an expert in Mission design you just need to be interested and enthusiastic about doing this stuff and this is the the most incredible experience I've had of my professional career so I would highly highly recommend this program to anybody interested in Mission design yeah any questions hi Michael uh I'm from UCSD just up the hill um I was wondering is there like how quickly or is it plooming like is it going to run out of water nice um well uh it's been active for I mean Enceladus is anywhere between like 100 million and over one two billion years old um and it's been like the e ring around Saturn is composed mostly of Enceladus plume materials so we know it's been around for a very very long time and we also know that the ocean is is a quite large um and makes up a pretty significant portion of the the mass of the Moon so I I there's a not any evidence as far as I'm concerned or as far as I know uh that it's running out anytime soon and we believe it's it's still active I'm curious um does this program kind of have a component where you assess the costs of certain missions and sort of optimize for that because that have a component that's the it's like the entire last week is like the so the New Frontiers five cost cap is 900 million and it takes like 700 million to take a piece of cardboard to Enceladus and so and so yeah that's a huge part of it and that's like a huge part of like working with TMax is to try and do rapid iterations of your your mission concept to see what you can do and what trade space you can explore to fall with under the cost cap because the problem isn't like finding all the science to do because like there's so much science you can do it's finding what it's doing the most science for the least money and so unfortunately that is a massive part of of mission design and formulation thank you hi uh Colin Robinson uh very man University I I was just wondering uh I know one of the big hindrances to uh sampling Organics from blooms and Enceladus is uh destruction of Organics because in the sampling processes right because of velocity and you just go you know at high speeds through the bloom with like a cup to pick up all that stuff lots of Organics are just gonna be obliterated so what steps were you guys thinking of taking to eliminate destruction of bioseignatures thank you so much for asking that question um I actually that's the research that I'm doing at Caltech is we're simulating hyper velocity impacts of eye screens um using impact ionization mass spectrometry and we're the only lab in the world that can do that at the moment that can actually simulate a distribution of I well I want to get i'll nerd out too much come find me to talk about that after after this if you want but to answer your question yes um there is a velocity regime where you have both efficient ionization assuming you're using an impact ionization Mass spectrometer for analysis of plume grains which is pretty necessary at this stage yes there is a velocity regime that you have efficient ionization and molecular survivability for a range of of compound classes and the survivability velocity range is depends on molecular functionality but it's somewhere between four and six kilometers per second it is like the Goldilocks zone that you wanna that you want to sample at so yes that's a fantastic question and that is a problem that a lot of very smart people are trying to solve right now in in terms of that speed four to six kilometers per second uh is that fast enough to be able to stay out of the gravitational pull of Enceladus okay yeah Enceladus does it there's not very much gravity there exactly that's tiny yeah thank you no problem uh hi I'm a river for paronica from Coco Cornell um quick question um but why there it's like a open for fracture for purposes uh cryova volcanism is that going to um impact the types of uh bio signatures that uh could be detected very much so that's a fantastic question um in each case um the mechanism of plume formation that's under underlying the surface um I'm trying to think of the best way to say it but the way the grains are formed actually strongly influences the composition of the grains because you have homogeneous nucleation where it's you just have like water that just freezes and is is shot out and like the open crevice boiling situation um where you have uh a heterogeneous nucleation where you have well I don't want to get too much in the weeds but but uh yes um for a an explosive cryovolcanic scenario like you mentioned um we wouldn't see very many um compositional differences from grain to grain whereas for the open crevice boiling scenario due to the different ice cream nucleation processes that that could occur you would see very distinct compositional differences in the grains and we see that in the CDA data that's where all those the um evidence for those Organics that I was talking about before those complex Organics that comes from Ice grains that are composed primarily of an organic phase that were formed very likely through open crevice boiling and so um I guess that's a long answer to saying yes that it very much matters that's why we want to find out okay our lunch delivery is running a little late so we have time for another question if sometimes someone has thanks Marshall I've heard this talk many times you're welcome and every time and every time it's enjoyable and every time I feel like I ask the question about uh what kind of mass spectrometer are you going to include what kind of resolution or msms capabilities do you need to detect biosignatures get isotopic information get through matrices of the salt grains crystals thank you you gave me an excuse to talk about that now um so for for the the gas the plume gas um you need some sort of like a qitms or like Mass specs type instrument that I'm sure you're familiar with that stuff um but where you need to be able to like have a sample Inlet where you take gas in and then you you determine the the composition of that and that's really necessary for uh assessing isotopic fractionation um because those typically have very high mass resolution which you need for looking at different isotope logs and things whereas for the plume grains um a lot of dust detectors don't have the same mass resolution um just due to the the way the instruments are designed and but you need information about the ice cream composition because of all the cool stuff is in the grains and the lower the bigger the grains are the lower the velocity the or the lower the altitude uh the more interesting the grin composition is and so you need in theory you could just use one to answer your question like a mass specs type instrument um where when I for those people that don't know Mass specs is an acronym for the mass spectrometer for planetary expert well enter export yes Mass Spectrum for Planetary Exploration that's going to be going on Europa clipper um but that can do grains but those sort of instruments have issues with some of the more refractory Organics and some inorganic species and so what you really need to be able to do this given that you have enough cost margin is you need a dust detector or a grain like some sort of impact ionization Mass spectrometer that can utilize these hyper velocity impacts as an ionization source to determine ice grain composition and also something where you can assess the composition of the plume gas as well thank you um so there are if I'll go back to a couple of slides um so it's in eccentric orbit the various intric orbit around Saturn and so if you look at I don't know can you see the the curse okay yeah you can right here see that little Green Dot um that's where the their every orbit you do like a small burn where you use a little bit of fuel to make sure that you stay uh in the orbit that you need to actually do these measurements and so it's not as huge of a deal and doesn't require like a ton of Delta V or like change in velocity of the spacecraft um but no that is something to consider and though you're right and that is something that we took into account when doing all these uh the orbital calculations uh so the that's before we actually start science operations um because upon Saturn orbital insertion um we're going too fast um and the the spacecraft the inclination altitude geometry things like that um aren't suitable to immediately enter science operations to start doing targeted Enceladus flybys and so we need to use Titan's gravity to further slow down so we can get within that goldilock zone that we talked about before for sampling thank you okay thank you okay this lunch will begin search soon in Surfside and then we'll reconvene again at 12.5 per second series all

excited for Stellar science I'd like to go ahead and start our next session these are short socks all right everyone's listening now okay and I want to preface this again just like yesterday's short talk sessions these are going to be short six minute talks there will be no time for questions after but these presenters will also have posters outside at the poster session directly afterwards okay so save your questions for them and without further Ado I'd like to welcome our first presenter today bolaga from Ohio University Athens thank you thank you hi everyone from Ohio University I'm a space biologist a bit different from astrobiologists in that we send plant samples to space and I will try to see how those plant samples adapt to the space flight environment and then we use information from these to make them better adapt to a stream environment on heart or to also prepare how we can cultivate plants in space for future cultivations future exploration and so I work on arabidopsis plants which is a model plant it's what E coli is to microbiologists and um its model because it's uh also the genome sequenced already and so we can easily trace a particular phenotype to a particular genotype so to the right up there is what the arabidosis siblings look like after we get them back from the space environment in this case I mean about the International Space Station at the lower Hutt orbit where we have zero gravity microgravity and where we have ionizing radiation and altered flue gas Dynamics as one of the extremities in that environment so basically we send seed to space we let those seeds germinate in space we let them grow for few days we freeze them and we return them to Earth and when they get part of Hearts I analyze them transcriptomics and proteomics to make uh to make sense of our such plant adapts to the space flight environment and for uh us to conduct specified environment we use different AdWords as you can see on top on top Air is the advanced plant habitat that's the the most desirable Hardware currently for almost everyone researching uh space plant biology and here we have the brick break Hardware I love using the brick it's got the name from the fact that it's it looks like a brick Block it's biological research in canister I work with it and this is the European modular cultivation system it being retired currently and being replaced by the multivariable platform so these are just a few of the many Hardwares that we used to send specimen to space plants micro but in this case we we use this to stand up plant to space uh the first multi homix are experiments conducted on plant Central space was conducted by my lab and then we discovered that uh comparing the look for change of the transcript that's the RNA to the look for change of the protein while plotting a correlation graph of it we discovered very low correlation between differentially expressed transcripts and differentially abundant protein which is uh indicative of the fact that post transcriptional modification of transcript is one of the Adaptive mechanism of plants to space flight environment that means not all RNA gets to become protein and that also net it's it's underscore the need for us to study procurements to conduct proteomic studies of these plants that we send to space because the proteomies will probably give more insight into the Adaptive mechanism than the transcriptomics unfortunately because protonic study uh require large tissue Mass which we don't have the luxury of having large tissue large plants sent to space most people conduct just transcriptomic study until date globally only for protonic study have been conducted on arabidosis and about ISS and these are the four protonic studies uh different environments are different uh conditions different variables uh age of the plants out where uh light condition seed line used the tissue type and the type of protein extracted they vary across all those uh four experiments two of those experiments were conducted on the lab I'm the one in charge of the last one in red called The Brick LED uh project so to get idea of um what's uh the uh to get idea of plants response on the the protonic level to the space flight environment based on these are field data set we have to do what we call meta analysis of the protonic data set from this of the protonic data sets from these four experiment and that's what I do so this is the first stage of the metal analysis so we start from the left ear are we intersected the protein um abundance about the detected protein across all the four Hardwares and common to the protein across all the four Hardware these are three proteins which are pick up one that's the microtubule destabilizing protein which is involved in chromosome separation during cell division it involves information of um cell shape and it's also involved in a transport vesicular transport implant and also we we discovered the comment of these four four data sets our protein is that the protein involving defense response and mRNA binding now I went a step further and isolated uh the data set called emcs which is a the data set called abrs Advanced biological research system I isolated it from the data from the general data set because it uh they use the mutant seed line so I I only call I compared those seed lines that were the wide type and from intersection of the three data set that com that you know that use our seed lines that are white type we have these eight proteins and here are the air the proteins so conducting the protein protein uh interaction network analysis we see that regulation of microtubule microtubule destabilization microtubule rearrangement is a major adaptation uh mechanism of plants to the extreme space flight environment and one thing we notice in phenotype of plants that we grow in space is that they are usually uh smaller looking less healthy compared to those grown on Earth where we have the full gravity and there are no ionizing radiation now I went further to compare the brick data set which are the one that we conducted in our lab and we can be so sure of so we have two of them we have the brick LED which were conducted in light you know this brick LED Hardware add light in it and we have the brick PDF view which had no light so all these plants this experiment were both flown to space uh weapon were both flew into space but won't add light one add more light both of them had no gravity are they so at The Intercept of them the protein here 186 of them would definitely be due to the space flight environment while the protein here will be due to photomorphogenesis that is growth in light cross interacting protein maybe between the hardware and growth and light and Elusive protein due to the advanced technology that we use on the brick LED compared to the brick PDF view why the protein here are those involved in scotomorphogenesis growth in darkness and cross interacting protein now I call this protein due to space flight environment I call them the brick intercept so comparing the brick intercept this is the brick intercept comparing it with another data set from the European modular cultivation system where they add a centrifuge about the International Space Station one decentric food having the 1G centrifuge above International Space Station eliminates microgravity so it introduced 1G gravity so this data set emcs as as excluded microgravity and everything in this data set is radiation so comparing our intersecting this brick intercept with this emcs data set whatever is in the middle here will definitely be due to radiation or altered fluid gas Dynamic you know in the absence of gravity plants don't pick water the same way that we do on Earth and whatever we have here is due to microgravity definitely and whatever we have here proteins here are due to the emcs hardware and cross interaction now doing a protein protein interaction a network of the uh proteins that we believe are due to radiation we see that ah most of them are involved in ribosome assembly ribosome biogenesis and um ribosome biogenesis and protein translational Machinery so one takeaway from this is that arabidosis ribosomal activity is altered by space flight ionizing radiation So currently I'm I'm comparing the transcriptomic data between these two data sets and we're also trying to do a wet lab determination of the specific role of this intersecting protein so we're hoping to collaboration on our protonic meta analysis of this uh space flight stuff there are a lot of things that could be done or made so uh my acknowledgmental Dr Sarah white that's my advisor and then Dr Colin Cruz from the National Lab in New Mexico and to the NASA analysis working group plant homies who sponsored this uh research thank you so much right thank you bolaga our next presenter will be Madeline Purnell from the University of Utah foreign into things because I have a lot to say on this topic so um extremophiles can help us predict the boundaries of life here on Earth and the possibility of life on other planets yet most extreme files that we study are typically single cellular organisms leaving a gap in knowledge about multicellular life and its habitability limits and Origins and so that's kind of where our work comes into play for my lab so we're a nematode lab um and nematodes are one of the most widespread and resilient animal phylums on earth they make about 80 of all animal life and are found on every continent and in every ecosystem including some found in like South African gold mines Antarctica and the dry valleys Etc so my work is based in the Great Salt Lake it's an analog Lake for the evaporated saline Lakes on Mars and it is also the fourth largest terminal lake in the world meaning that it gets a large inflow of water um but the only source of outflow is via evaporation it's also been geologically consistent for the last 780 Millennia and was only once previously part of like a Paleo histeine freshwater lake for a really brief period of time but one thing that you might notice is that it has a really Stark salinity gradient that's caused from a railroad construction that cut the Great Salt Lake in half creating the North and South arms so the South arm is about at 15 salinity due to the inflow of water and the north arm doesn't get any inflow of water and so stays at about 27 salinity um 15 solidity adjusts so you are aware is about three times more saline than the ocean and is well beyond the previous maximum recorded salinity gradient that nematodes have been found to live in and so my lab went searching for nematodes in the Great Salt Lake and so we chose four different six different sites sorry to look at three which were from an inflow river that um was between like fresh water to hypo saline conditions and then three from inside the Great Salt Lake which were well into the hyper saline conditions and it is here that we found some nematodes so one unique structure in the Great Salt Lake are these microbialites um they're Organo sedimentary structures and they're built by file photosynthetic microbes and so our host to complex microbial communities as well as our nematodes they're also in the oldest known evidence of life on Earth some dating back to about 3.4 billion years ago um and so they can kind of offer us a glimpse of life before more complex life forms and they range about 20 to 30 percent of the Great Salt lake lake bottom so we've found that these nematodes through 18s sequencing are novel hysterity species Monastery are typically a freshwater nematode though some are also found in marine ecosystems and so our goal now is to look at their genome and transcriptome in order to be able to tell the presence and absence of Gene families and see what genes are being functionally used here in the Great Salt Lake to potentially like help with saline UV and temperature tolerances and we're also looking at co evolution with other microbiota so by isolating single worms we can look at Presence of microbiota in or on the worm so we want to be able to look at diatoms fungus and bacteria and so far we've been able to do V4 region of 16sr RNA sequencing of bacteria and we found a variety of bacterial orders that are found in and on our worms but surprisingly 70 of all the bacteria found are only unique to the worm and have never been found in microbialite structures previously meaning that these microbiota are possibly living in symbiosis with these pneumatodes and offering a variety of functions such as phototrophic potential solute accumulation and arsenic tolerance that allows them to be capable of living in this extreme environment so by identifying and Reporting these communities it can help us understand mechanisms that maintain a functional ecosystem in some of the most extreme environments on Earth and could provide information about the evolution of life on Earth and also Beyond I'd like to thank my lab for all of their help and thank you today and I'll be at poster for if you have any questions all right thank you Madeline up next we have Fernanda Jamel from the University of Sao Paulo hello I'm Fernando I'm a PC student from University of Sao Paulo in Brazil and I'll talk about my work uh microbial mediated carbon mineralization from lagova media in Brazil so uh the motivation for this works the importance of studying the evolution of life on Earth as we know that the first signs of Life are eliminations and fossils of microorganisms and within this we have the investigation of potential evidence of life such as microbial forces and stromatolites that we need to differentiate from magnetic form of an inorganic mineral so therefore oh it's necessary to investigate the biogenicity that is that if if that was actually formed by life or not and also we have the Dolomite problem that is a major question that scientists have been studying in this region of flag of are one of the most important records of from the past and even if with the several studies related to development formation uh the results are still controversial maybe to the the little understanding uh that exists and the difficulty of obtaining this mineral in laboratory conditions like uh below 50 degrees Celsius so given this we have the so called Dolomite problem uh which has been much debated over uh the last few years however it is possible to find a few current dollar my precipitation events in hyper saline lakes and alkaline environments such as this region of Lago of Emira and Brazil that is next to each other and um so these are one of the few places in the world that has dull of my precipitation uh today so in these places there are microorganisms responsible for mediating the carbonate precipitation which can serve as a nucleation centers for for the mineral uh within their biofilm their EPS uh exopolymerically extracellular substance and this photo was taken during my field collection and it shows their a thick layer of of dolomite of dolomite sediment below and above we can see like a microbial match with a biofilm uh in the um on the top so talking briefly about right precipitation by microorganisms in nature environmental conditions modulate the communities and within that a lot of microorganisms uh they are known for their ability to precipitate minerals so these minerals can be precipitated by physical methods in which the microbial Community serves as a nucleation of a nucleation site for the deformation of carbonate or it can be in a chemical way or an inorganic as an inorganic mineral so this precipitation occurs mainly due to changes in the pH the amount of organic carbon dissolves in the medium or the environment and the availability of calcium and magnesium ions in the case of dolomite and the availability of nucleation sites uh for Crystal formation that can be the exopolymeric substances present in the in the biofilms of bacteria so some microorganisms have the ability to produce biofumes formed by these these extracellular polymeric substances which are mainly composed of exopolysaccharides acidic residues uh sugars that have a negative charge and and can bind to different ions such as calcium magnesium so the role of DPS in the precipitation of carbonate occurs in two uh from initially the EPS can reduce precipitation by sequestering metallic ions but during the degradation of the DPS by some sulfur reducing bacteria the resulting High concentration of of calcium calcium magnesium ions can favor precipitation and in addition The Continuous supply of ions added to a more alkaline environment due to micro the micro environmental generated micro environment generated by the EPS May favor the bioprecipitation of of these minerals so now moving to the Azure biological importance it's interesting to know that the environmental condition of Mars in the novakian Hesperian periods um quite similar to why similar to Earth so at that time it was a much it has it had a much denser atmosphere a higher temperatures uh than the possible presence of liquid water on the surface which indicates the potential of of the planet to have supported microbial life so in the face of this some geological studies of g0 crater on Mars have demonstrated a large carbonate deposits in the west region of the crater and on on Earth regions of hypersonic shell Lakes are closely related to the biological deposition of carbonates indicating great potential for identifying identifying preserved by a signature in these regions uh so I I would just specifically uh for uh through these objectives so my objectives are testing a carbonate mineral precipitation using allophytic bacteria from Lego Batman and do structural morphological and optic investigation of Carbonite minerals like x ray diffraction remin spectroscopy synchronized techniques and uh then established by viable protocols for biosignature identification so uh briefly uh you can see more in my poster or the precipitation experiment the methodology of one tonality uh that is a reference that studies this uh this region uh was used to test if metabolically inactivated cells within biofilm could precipitate minerals only with the biofilm so the experiment was carried out in a controlled environment at 30 degrees and was divided into these conditions that we had a DPS treatment that we let the bacteria grow in for 15 days then we added the antibiotics to inactivate the cells with the biofin form then we had the bacteria growing normally then we had a treatment with antibiotics being added from the beginning and we had the control without victory so we did this experiment to test if this was possible to form uh precipitates only with the biofilm but we said we said we saw that uh it's uh we we've we found a viable cells after after some time of of experiment within this biofilm so I think that it's really hard to inactivate cells in this way so we are trying other protocols and here here is only my preliminary results just giving a brief about this oh I'll talk to my poster after obtaining these precipitates we analyze the X ray diffraction to identify the mineral phases present in the sample of the bacteria idiomarina The Strain called here in the right we took a scanning electron microscopy uh of the the precipitates from the same bacteria and we can see the difference different morphologies such as dumbbells shapes and rounded shapes of calcium carbonates and this morphology are usually associated with biogenic minerals so we still need to analyze EDS Spectrum so for a conform conform or exactly which mineral each morphology relates to and finding minor shifts in the the phratograms and the the Raman spectrums for establishing viable protocols so this is my poster session uh 22 and that's it thank you so much thank you Fernanda all right next we're going to welcome Miriam Fernandez from the University of Colorado Boulder thank you foreign and I'm here to talk about the salts of the earth and how they could help when looking for life in the solar system Earth can provide us with analogs um that can mimic extra planetary environments in one of the most ones most often used for Mars is the Atacama Desert I'm really proud of this graphic so in the Atacama life has been shown to live off the deli questions of salts but can the salts that I studied deliquest in all the common conditions so for my project I tried to answer two scientific questions could nitrate salts or their salt mixtures uptake water or release water sorry uptake or release water under autocom environmental conditions and could the temperature and relative humidity values lead to nitrate salt deliquesins so to answer this we used a Ramen microscope attached to an environmental cell in which the temperature and relative humidity could be controlled and we use this to study the phase transitions of our salts of Interest so we can answer our first question could nitrate salts or salt mixtures take up water under autonomic conditions well yes and thank you for coming to my talk um so but let me tell you why and so the first thing that we're going to do is look at the spectral series of the pure magnesium nitrate um so if we look at the crystalline nitrate which is going to be shown by the black Spectra at the bottom it starts off at a higher wave number of 1062 and as we increase the as we decrease the Rel sorry increase the decrease the temperature and increase the relative humidity it's going to stay there until it reaches the deliques it's relative humidity of 63 percent um at which point it shifts the lower wave number of 1052 so it's going to stay here and this is really cool it's going to stay here and as we increase the temperature and decrease the relative humidity it stays at that lower wave number until the efflorescence relative humidity of 23 and that means that magnesium nitrate the Pier 1 can maintain a metal stable brine for over a 40 RH change range um so we repeated these experiments multiple times over different temperatures and we made this lovely phase diagram uh and it's as temperature versus relative humidity so for the pure magnesium nitrate has a hydrate the Dell questions is going to be shown by the blue dots and the efflorescence is shown by the orange squares and it was relatively temperature independent and occurred around 25 RH so magnesium nitrate exhibited a very large hysteresis which you can tell by the gap between the Della questions and the fluorescence relative humidity and this is going to be our metastable brine region but I also mentioned salt regions so what about them so we did the exact same experiment but we used um different salts so we have magnesium nitrate so this is a one to one mixture and we have magnesium nitrate on the left and magnesium perchlorine on the right and we see that same shift in the nitrate Peak which we use to determine when Della questions would occur and so we took different ratios of chlorine nitrate and we looked at how the pcori could influence the water uptake of the nitrate salts in the soil and so the blue dots once again are going to be the Dell questions and the orange triangles are the efflorescence um and then the lines in between is the average of the experiment so what we can see is that for chlorate seem to be helping or assisting with the magnesium nitrate water uptake or deloquiescence and so if we look at our overall picture so this is pure magnesium nitrate and its Dell questions is at 60 RH however if we look at our epichlorate mixtures we can see that the water uptake seems to be assisted by that and we see this with the downward facing Trend um so we also wanted to look at what affects a less hygroscopic or deliquisite salt would have on that and so we did a one to one mixture with sulfate nitrates and we saw that this did not inhibit the water uptake of nitrate because it's still below the deloquiescence relative humidity of magnesium nitrate so finally we can answer our last question which is could the temperature and relative humidity values lead to nitrate salt double croissants in the soil so we took our phase diagram and we took relative humidity and temperature DNS from these two slides in the Atacama Desert and both of these sides contain nitrates perchlorates in the soil composition and also sulfates so site a which you see above was relatively close to the ocean and was therefore warmer and more humid this was likely a contributor to why the nitrate cells in the soil could maintain a stable liquid brine which is shown by the dark blue highlights and it made a stable line which is the light blue highlights throughout most of the year then if we look at site B this was more Inland and therefore significantly drier and colder but despite this we do have points throughout the year in which the salts could uptake and deliquis and maintain a medicinal place so of course this is very highly variable and that could be due to the different environmental conditions as well as the different soil compositions and would need to be further studied so um if you have any questions comments concerns or a job please stop by my poster which is number 23 so thank you thank you Miriam I like the splash of humor in there keep us awake this time of day so next we have povolus simonis from the University of California Santa Cruz hello everyone I'm Paula schimones a researcher from Lithuania currently located at Santa Cruz and my professor is David dimmer so organic compounds including building blocks of life may be synthesized in the accretion disk of newly forming solar system and may fall down to earth as a meteorites and thus phosphates uh ribose and all nuclear bases were all found in meteorites and under certain conditions May recombine into your nucleotides which are present in all contemporary life another essential compound is lipid which is a membrane forming antipipilic molecule and simple lipids were also found in carbonicious chondrites and even though their structure was way more simple they can form vesicles so if these compounds fall down to the oceans they are lost in a dilute buffer but if we make it down to the surfaces of volcanic landmass they get a shot at Birth participating in the origin of life so compounds falling in from space synthesized in the biogenic atmosphere cooked up in hydrothermal systems or through work very through Rock weathering May accumulate on the surface perhaps finding their way in a volcanic caldera and the key to getting things to interact is concentration so small hot spring pools may be perfect place to go come cook up some soup of life and uh hydrothermal fields of interconnected pools could not only concentrate the compounds but intermix them between reservoirs subjecting them to different temperature pH Elemental and mineral compositions and for any system to move from simple to more complex one is it must be subject to cycling and the flows of compounds including building blocks of membranes and polymers may find their way into a pool which fills up by a pulse from nearby geyser dries down and fills up again a cycle or an engine oh engine oh sorry is then formed when a polymers between dry lipid layers uh are synthesized and during rehydration they may assemble into membrane bounded protocols and the stabilizing effects of polymers and membranes allow the protocells to be tested with some surviving next dry down as a protocell aggregate together they form gel like phase where metabolic Cycles can arise and as a grade fully dries down the protocells can uh are merging and forming lamellar structures where polymerase can resynthesize template and allocate so after many search Cycles simple biological functions can emerge which uh yeah a simple biological functions can emerge and these ideas are backed by many studies and here you can see a model of lasagna of life where nucleotides are trapped between layers of lipid membranes and such structures are confirmed by x ray diffraction experiment and the trapping of nucleotides between the layers are beneficial because such structures allow pre polymers to form and not only that here you can see that blue lines are with lipid present and if we compo compare the deporination reactions which are degradation of purine nuclear nucleotides in the samples with lipid present those reactions are really inhibited if we cook up such lasagna at sufficiently height temperatures you can see in the last graph at 90 degrees of the nucleotides can really undergo condensation reactions and become well oligonic nucleotides so RNA or DNA like molecules and the the most important message from all this presentation is that this is a real system like you can take your Prebiotic soup and go to Kamchatka or New Zealand or even in California the hot spring pool pour it down and after a couple of Cycles you will see like real protocells with oligonucleotides which are of sufficient length to already have enzymatic functions so my goal for a rest of air is to use nanopore sequencing to study those sequences to check whether I can find some functional ones so these ideas and results brought our team to a city where we are running a Genesis engine which is simulation chamber of volcanic land mass with a lot of poles where we can test the different conditions and our goal is to understand what fraction of habitable planets are actually durable and by durable I mean what fraction of habitat in what fraction of habitable planets the life can actually start not many people are talking about that but conditions for a life to start will be very different than the conditions which are needed for our life to thrive yes so if you are interested in this project you can learn more on a set website and I invite you to stop by my poster where we can discuss how we can cook some soup of life and maybe even start the second Genesis so thank you very much all right thank you so much now I'm craving lasagna up next we have Michaela Liang from the University of California Riverside alrighty hi everyone thanks for having me today um my name is Michaela Liang I'm currently a PhD candidate at the University of California Riverside um I'll be talking to you today about my work on novel methylated biosignatures and specifically their application to exoplanets which I usually don't have to say because I'm usually talking to astronomers so that's kind of fun um there's a little bit of a breakdown diagram here on the far side that's my left so you're right um that's kind of showing the processing of these molecules all the way from surface fluxes atmospheric chemistry um the production of spectral features and we're kind of thinking about how this will vary across a variety of Stellar types so that's kind of just a very quick uh summary breakdown um so let's jump into talking about why we're specifically interested in these methylated gases um and the answer is largely that there's a major false positive problem um for the first biosignature detections a lot of molecules um Like Oxygen ozone methane things like that that we expect to be potentially the first molecules detected that could be connected to life in terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres can also be produced by a variety of planetary processes including thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry and so these methylated gases are specifically uh almost exclusively produced by life and all of the other Pathways that we've investigated have been very minimal so we're really excited that these gases could potentially be a very strong affirmative uh signal of life um and these gases are generated by the process of volatile methylation which actually we believe to be a descendant or perhaps a Rel relative in some way of the process of DNA methylation which for you biologists out there I'm sure you're all much more familiar with than I but we see volatile methylation in a variety of different ecosystems including microbial mats the open ocean and primarily actually a lot of terrestrial Marine kind of crossover ecosystems we also see it done by a variety of organisms primarily a single cellular life but we do also see everyone's favorite Brassica vegetables um also produce methylated gases and we think in particular that methylation is connected to the process of environmental detoxification um and that the Need For Life to kind of control its environment is possibly a fundamental characteristic of life itself and so when we're thinking about you know what life might look like under fundamentally different biogeochemistry um you know we're it's probably still going to need to be controlling that surroundings in some ways we're really excited about that potential tie in as well we're not the first people to think about methylated biosignatures there are a previous study specifically cigarette all 2005 and Domingo Goldman at all 2011 which specifically show one an enhanced buildup level around M dwarfs and two a secondary ethane biosignature that's produced by atmospheric photolysis of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide um and that produces a potentially detectable ethane signature um and so we're going to follow a relatively similar uh pathway we're jumping from labland that we've been in for the last couple of talks to modeling land um and uh primarily we're going to be talking about uh photochemical and spectral modeling basically thinking about how these gases are processed in the atmosphere um and what those potential signals uh might look like um just jumping into some results um we have first here methyl bromide which is again on your left um and we have methyl iodine which is on I think you're right um and you'll notice that as I said before for methyl chloride they see an atmospheric buildup level that's much higher around these M dwarf uh cooler redder stars and we actually see that uh buildup replicated and actually uh even more enhanced for methyl bromide and this result for methyl iodide is from like literally last week um so that's brand new um and we're also seeing again the same sort of enhanced buildup you'll notice that it's to a lesser degree and we think that's probably because it's just a larger molecule and so it's a larger molecule it's going to be hit by more uh potentially active uh photochemical light so we use this photochemical model to to create profiles of gases in the atmosphere and kind of figure out where everything is where where it's at in the atmosphere and then we're using like I said a series of spectral models um so this these are mid infrared emission Spectra um and the most important thing that I'll call your attention to here there's kind of a lot going on but the bottom row is actually showing an experiment that we did where we add multiple methylated gases in this case methyl chloride and methyl bromide and you'll actually notice that the features that we see especially for Proxima Centauri which is going to be that plot all the way down in the bottom corner um that feature is actually a little bit wider and a little bit deeper than just kind of the simple sum of the features and that's partially because we're doing self consistent photochemistry um and so you do get higher buildup levels and also because this absorption feature in here 10 microns is actually the acetah halogen Bond and so acetochlorine and Cedar bromine are sort of uh next to each other and overlapping a little bit but really creating this much larger feature um so we're optimistic that a future telescope capable of minute infrared emission spectroscopy could detect these um and we also think that while this could detect a methylated gas we could potentially fingerprint a specific methylated gas using extremely high resolution ground based spectroscopy um and potentially one mode that we could use for the emission spectroscopy that I was just showing is the life telescope which is a concept Mission um that's actually run by the European Space Agency where they're using interferometry to essentially get a larger uh approximation of a telescope rather than putting like 100 meter telescope in space because that's actually going to be very difficult to do um and so you could see here that there's um simulated error bars for the observations um and that there's kind of a noticeable difference uh between the atmospheres without these methylated gases and especially the higher flux cases um and we can also look at this as a kind of comparison to the uh Sigma of the detection and you can see we get some pretty significantly large features here and we're optimistic again that if any biosignatures are detectable on these planets um these are very optimistic planets where uh simulating for but hopefully these methylated gases will be among uh those bio signatures that it's possible to detect so I will leave you with my conclusions I think I am right on time um I'm at poster nine which is right on the other side of this wall or you can feel free to contact me my information is on the slide thank you Michaela up next we have Jordan mccague from Georgia Institute of Technology all right hello everyone my name is Jordan mckaig and I am a PhD candidate at Georgia Tech I'm working with Dr Chris Carr on using solid state nanopores to detect biosignatures and think about potential for agnostic life detection so throughout our universe or throughout our solar system rather there are a variety of planetary bodies that have conditions thought to be hospitable for life so things that are in the middle of this fine diagram containing the right raw materials energy sources solvents and climate conditions for living things to possibly persist many of these environments are aqueous and saline environments and as we've discussed previously today and yesterday salts have a major influence on the ability of an organism to live in an environment as well as the potential for Bio signature um excuse me sorry biosignature preservation and I'm particularly interested in how salts can interact with these biomolecules in terms of doing detection with nanopores so specifically the biosignatures that I'm interested in are nucleic acids and ribosomes nucleic acids that's your DNA and RNA it's a linear charge polymer that is responsible for storing and regulating genetic information ribosomes are cellular Machinery that translate this information into usable proteins um oh sorry excuse me nucleic acids and ribosomes are ubiquitous to all known life and are part of the central dogma biology so this is a paradigm in biology that traces the flow of information from these charged Polymers of DNA and RNA through proteins so it's been proposed that molecules of similar structure and function but different biochemistry from some of these things could actually serve as evidence for life as we don't know it um in 2017 it was proposed that linear charged polymers with repeating units analogous to nucleic acids like DNA and RNA could serve as an agnostic by a signature and we are also working on a paper arguing that translation performing molecules of a quantized size analogous ribosomes could similarly serve this function since these don't have the same biochemistry of Life as we know it here on Earth it would require detection with a method that doesn't necessitate any specific chemical composition which leads us to solid state nanopores this is an agnostic mode of detection which requires a molecule to be suspended in a conductive solution so your nanopore here is a nanometer scale pore that's drilled into a membrane a current is passed over it and a voltage or a pressure differential drives molecules through the pore as things go through on these translocations create blockages and current which can be used to get information about the biomolecules and I just want to highlight again this does not require specific biochemistry making it exciting for not only investigating living things here on Earth but also potentially elsewhere in the solar system so what we did was show a proof of concept for something called the anterior Nano counter which was a proprietary solid state nanoportin shreds and these are all the different biomolecules that we analyze including some DNA samples RNA and ribosomes and if you'd like to hear more details about how specifically this went down please come talk to me at my poster and then also I have some of the example um results so first we have a few graphs showing just different example events with signature specific events for each biomolecule structure and then some heat maps showing the change in conductance in the dwell time for all the events in a specific run and then some overlaid samples of what all these events looked like and what I just want to highlight here is um let's see do I have okay great um I have overlay DNA events all here in the blue this is a circular plasmid um so it's just a circular piece of DNA and it is a pretty short dwell time but also a much larger change in current and this is probably due to the circular structure instead of a linear polymer um so when you have a circular piece of DNA going through the nanopore you would have four strands of DNA instead of the two strands that's in a regular linear fragment similarly for linear fragments we have these two right here with this one in red being a shorter fragment and the one in black being a longer fragment which is reflected in that longer dwell time then I also have the data for the ribosomal detection so there are a few key classes of results here the ones in box a we interpreted as being intact ribosomes since they are larger and then things in box B would have been smaller particles which we actually think were ribosomal fragments so we thought that maybe we had some issues with the buffer causing that precipitation which allows us not only analyze the exact intact ribosomes as well as fragments themselves so if you'd like to hear more please come talk to me at my poster I'll be at number 19 which is um kind of over by the window thank you all wonderful thank you so much Jordan um up next last but not least Justin Park coming from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute hello everybody my name is Justin Park I am a second year PhD student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and one thing we're interested in doing in our Labs is reconstructing ancient atmospheres as they pertain to important evolutionary steps in our atmosphere's history so what I do is I look at ancient atmospheres trapped in halite fluid inclusions so halite as we've seen in previous talks is an evaporative mineral it forms in these really dry arid environments where evaporation is the dominating Force as it does so it can form these things called fluid inclusions as shown in the top right up here and they can encapture air or brine in the mineral Matrix now these can be primary or secondary meaning they form at the time the mineral precipitates or forming sometime later with some secondary fluid event and oftentimes they form an assemblages of hundreds or thousands of inclusions at once now what I'm interested in doing is looking at the gases that are trapped in these primary inclusions and saying something about the evolving composition of the atmosphere now we do have some evidence for what we think the atmosphere looked like and how it evolved here I have plotted one of the major models suggesting the change in partial pressure of nitrogen oxygen or CO2 and methane as a function of time starting with the moon forming event 4.5 billion years ago now if you'll notice here there is a lot of uncertainty in these measurements and this is due to them being made with indirect proxy measurements now also in the period between 2 and 1 billion years ago here we have this period known as the boring billion and it's aptly named for the apparent stagnancy of the atmospheric evolution now what we're interested in doing is providing ancient atmospheric constraints using fluid inclusions in the period between these two points using direct analysis from 1.4 billion year old fluid inclusions so we can do this by loading our samples into a special crushing device crushing them this ruptures our inclusions and we can pass the gas directly into a quadrupole mass spectrometer when we do so we see peaks in our signal that correspond to each Crush these Peaks can be integrated and Quantified by comparing to known calibration points thus we can get an idea of the composition and known amount of moles of nitrogen oxygen argon and CO2 present in these inclusions when we backtrack and calculate the ancient atmosphere composition we do have to be wary of any aqueous contributions as we know Henry's law tells us this atmosphere may also be dissolved in the brine phase and equilibrium so when we did this we saw some variability in our results here I have plotted the mole fraction of nitrogen oxygen argon and CO2 as a function of the size of each sample one thing we can notice is that the primary and secondary inclusions do capture different atmospheres that are distinct from one of one another now we're very interested in the primary inclusions as that's the environment that the mineral formed in and we can compute a average partial pressure or density of each gas and compare it to the modern atmosphere when we do that we saw some very interesting things back 1.4 billion years ago we found atmospheric nitrogen was roughly the same partial pressure as it is today atmospheric oxygen was around a tenth as dense argon was about half as dense and carbon dioxide was actually eight times more dense now each of these gases has really important implications but due to time I'm only going to have time to talk about oxygen today so when we looked at our oxygen results there are measured partial pressure revealed some pretty interesting things here I have it compared to many of the predicted models that have been proposed what we saw is that we captured more oxygen than these models would have proposed this indicates that these direct measurements might be able to capture things that the proxies are unable to and this has some pretty important implications the oxygen that we measured is above theoretical lower limits necessary for the early evolution of life and it's also an agreement with some evidence suggesting there was a developed ozone layer at this time now on the right here I have plotted a phylogenetic tree showing the marked diversification of red algae in the mesopoterozoic Now red algae are very important as they're some of the first photosynthetic eukaryotes that gives them an evolutionary advantage to produce more oxygen than their predecessors and this becomes really interesting when we compare this to our timing of the deposition of our samples we can see they're roughly contemporaneous and thus our elevated oxygen measurements are likely due to the presence of these red algae so I hope I've shown here today that the atmospheric oxygen here is pointing a more Dynamic picture of the boring billion and it might not have been so boring at all we have important implications of these ancient red algae evolving at this time period that led to this so with this who have shown that fluid inclusions can capture and maintain direct evidence of ancient atmospheres for hundreds of millions of years if not billions with mass spectrometry we can probe the contents of the gas that are trapped within these and we can look into how the atmosphere has evolved we aimed to make compositional measurements of the atmosphere 1.4 billion years ago and we found something very different than our present atmosphere hopefully in the future we can make isotopic ratio measurements and see any further Evolution trends so with that thank you all for listening if you have any questions I'd be happy to talk to you about my poster number 14 after this wonderful thank you so much Justin all right guys so um our final poster session of the conference will be beginning just now out here and we will meet back here at 3 30 for our sadly final talk session techno signatures and life detection

seconds foreign foreign thank you thank you foreign foreign [Music] [Music] but before we start the talk session officially Jaime Cordova would like to make a quick announcement so I'm going to welcome him up for that alrighty so hi everyone uh so I'm Jaime I'm at UW Madison uh this is Rachel uh from UCR we are both part of the early career committee for the new life research coordination Network just to make you all aware so life research for the life RCN is the newest RCN uh part of NASA Astro bio we are a network of astrobiologists focused on the evolution of or on the co evolution of Earth and life uh we are looking to explore ways to advance the science and its implications for the search for life on other worlds uh we just wanted to make you all aware of this so you could uh see our website here we have a Twitter and we also have a YouTube channel where we have our seminar series the QR code that is on the screen right now is for uh our main website but we do have a seminar series that we started uh we just had our first seminar series uh last month we actually know this month pass uh we just started in May our next seminar it will be taking place on June 5th uh this is by uh Dr Maria revolia Gomez from uh UCI and she'll be talking about Innovations and constraints uh evolution of metabolic rules and their ecological relevance you are welcome to scan the QR code that's there uh then that'll take you to our resume registration it is uh all virtual and it's going to be taking place on the first Monday of ever anything else you want to have um as many of you know we also have stickers for the life RCN so if you would like one come see one of us yeah yeah we're probably already given out like a lot 100 of these but if you want more we've got more so well you're welcome to come get get some from uh from either of us and uh if you have any questions about the life RCN uh please uh come up to us and uh we're happy to talk about it cool thank you all right thank you so much guys and we already have our first presenter on standby I'm here to welcome Rachel Sabrina from the University of California Riverside great hi everyone um yeah so my name is Rachel surprise um I'm a PhD candidate at the University of California Riverside and today I'm going to be talking to you all about the sedimentological signatures of backgrounds in the pre cambrian a novel method for their detection um automated detection in remote contexts and implications for the search for Life on Mars so it's well accepted that in Mars has passed there was liquid water on the surface right so this provides the potential for there to have been past microbial life and when we're thinking about looking for evidence of this past microbial life a lot of people in this room um like to think about signatures of this microbial life that are microscopic or molecular but as a paleontologist I'm more interested in macroscopic textural signatures that we can observe in the sedimentological record from standard imagery right so to find these types of signatures that could be useful for the search for Life on Mars we can turn to the Precambrian Earth which is a really useful data set for us to think about how past microbial life expresses itself in the sedimentological record because it is dominated by a record of organic matte grounds um during a time when life on Earth was very simple right um and luckily uh these organic backgrounds formed by a consortia of prokaryotes and eukaryotes mainly single cellular um have a significant impact on the sedimentological record um we heard earlier today about something called the extracellular polymeric substance that microbes excrete when they are forming a background that is just kind of this like sticky substrate and this has an impact on the sedimentological record in that it binds baffles and traps sediment that it is living on and within and thus prevents erosion and stabilizes sediment in part this contributes to in carbonate settings things that you'll probably you're probably familiar with like microbialites and stromatolites but I'm more interested in how this is expressed in solicit clastic settings which is broadly applicable to the Martian geologic environment right and one way that it can be expressed is in texture organic surfaces or iterative Organo sedimentary surface textures I'm showing you an example of that up here on the right that's actually a fossil surface um and they also impact um sedimentological packaging in a way that we can identify and cross section so when I'm talking about kind of these not ground bio signatures I think this brings up a really important question that I want to kind of frame my whole talk in in which is that if life ever existed on Mars was it ever abundant enough to form organic backgrounds and impact the sedimentological record on a macro macroscopic scale like we see in the Precambrian and my answer to that is I don't know um and the more I think about it the less I'm convinced that it ever did but this is still an outstanding question that we need to think about and there's one way to find out um and again this is to Leverage The pre came Brand Rock record so as I mentioned we have billions of years of evidence of backgrounds existing in the pre cambrian a lot of which is fossil evidence of mats like what I'm showing up here on the right these are not great bio signatures for the search for Life on Mars because it to identify them you would need to excavate betting planes and it also relies on the fossilization of these surfaces that um necessitates a lot of comp like a suite of complex topanomic or preservational processes that are not guaranteed to have existed on Mars um so instead I'm interested in looking at the impacts of matte grounds and that that extra polymeric substance extracellular polymeric substance that they secrete um on sedimentological packaging um as it manifests as discrete sedimentary structures um that cannot occur in the absence of biological mediation so one of these sedimentological signatures that I'm talking about today are called Palm cess ripples so I'm showing you images of those here these are from the nilpina edio national park in South Australia which was recently opened as a national park oh my animations are weird sorry about that um but if you want to read more about it it was published um a little story about the national park in NASA astrobiology recently um but Palm says ripples are defined as stacks of sandstone bedding planes that have rippled bottoms and ripple top surfaces so we can see if we look at this bedding plane here their ripples preserved on the top as well as on the bottom but what does this mean in terms of like evidence for life right um we can look at this figure here to see kind of the biological processes behind the formation of these palmsest ripples so looking at uh section B of this figure when we think about pre cambrian ecosystems microbial mats were ubiquitous within the world's oceans covering the sea floor so when these mats grew on the sea floor what they would do is stabilize the rippled surfaces so when a new depositional event occurred the ripples were not eroded um and are thus cast on the base of the new depositional event and then the two betting planes remain as discrete bed forms that are not Amalgamated together so this then continues as a process resulting in stacks of these Sandstone betting planes with no fine grained inner beds um and is a definitive signature of past life that cannot occur in the absence of biological mediation so this is potentially a really interesting biosignature for us to keep in mind when we're thinking about the search for Life on Mars and just you can compare it to kind of modern processes um or a broadleaf and Resort conditions where we don't have backgrounds if you get the deposition of sandstone on Sandstone the ripples are going to erode and the betting planes are going to become Amalgamated resulting in a cross section something like this so you can tell that they're very distinct um cross sections one with definitive evidence of past microbial life so all in all we can see that Palm says ripples are potentially good biosignatures for us to keep in mind because they cannot be formed by abiotic processes and they can occur when and that is very thin so they can even occur under biofilm mediation so where it's not dependent on the presence of eukaryotes and they're easily identifiable as macroscopic features in standard imagery so you don't need a ton of analytical methods to identify them but this is not to say there are no limitations right firstly this is restricted to rippled faces you have to have ripples occurring um in order for this to be identifiable and cross section but we know these are preserved on Mars so this doesn't preclude the use of this feature as a biosignature and additionally the lithological criteria is narrow you have to be be able to identify the fact that this cross section is comprised of only sandstone and nothing no like Clays or silts um but again this is an ability we have um to ascertain on the Martian surface so with this in mind we can kind of think about well then how would we detect them right I could go through by hand and look at all of the images coming out from the Mars perseverance Rover um but that's time consuming right so there's some things we need to consider in actually using this as a biosignature um first you know there's a large number of images we would ideally like to have rapid identification of these features like as the images are taken so we can identify Target sites of interest for further analysis because Palm says ripples alone will not be enough evidence for us to be like oh there was life um you would need expertise in backgrounds and their impact on the sentimentological record and of course you want to minimize human error so with all these caveats in mind I was kind of thinking you know maybe the best way for us to approach this problem is to use an automated technique to identify um polysest ripples in images of cross sections so this is exactly what I did but I am not an expert in this so I collaborated with the visualization in intelligent systems laboratory or viz lab in the College of Engineering at UCR and worked with Dr birbanu and Panama genital Agata who did a lot of this work with me and the first thing I did was show them my data set from the pre cambrian sedimentological record of we had starting about 200 images of palm cess ripples because this project was born in covid and I had no access to the field um so we started with this relatively limited data set and identified caveats of the data set that the program would need to overcome including variable scale of images variable resolution of images and it would need to have the ability to account for extraneous features that are not related to pound test ripples like plants fractures Talus dust and shadows um and all three of these problems are problems that we would also have um in like Mars or images coming from Mars besides the plants um so we started developing this program and phase one we developed the scene aware perception augmentation using composite embedding for segmentation or space egg which uses quora and sge to identify images um pounds as ripples in images about crop so these are just kind of a schematic of those different different methodologies if you're interested in the actual computer vision aspect of it I encourage you to look at our paper genre legada at all 2021 and this first past this first pass their phase one development um was able to identify policest ripples in cross section so you can see in the pink box that is space egg and it outperforms other state of the art techniques for identifying um planar features in imagery and identifies Palm says Ripple bed Junctions with an 89 accuracy rate but 89 is not that great we thought we could do more if we had more images so once covered restrictions lifted a little bit we took 800 more images to uh kind of do phase two of this project wherein we developed SpaceX 2.0 which instead uses used a combination of Aurora and base net shown here this paper is currently in review and this um gave us a 92.32 accuracy so much improved and again we see that it outperforms other techniques as well as our original space egg so you can see it's much better at segmenting out the planar features that we are interested in and like really concentrating on the regions of Interest so to kind of conclude Palm says ripples are an important and definitive biosignature that should be included in Target structures on Mars and we have developed a technique for accurately detecting them using automated methodologies which is potentially useful for our search for Life on Mars um and just to say our next steps this project is not done our next step is to develop a classifier where we can feed through a bulk of images of different different geologic features it will be able to sort out between likely pound says Ripples and non palm test Ripple cross sections and then those likely poems as Ripple cross sections will be fed into space egg 2.0 and that will give us a probability of um the presence of a pound cess Ripples and we'll also have the ability to classify morphology in other aspects of these features so with that I would like to think on my funding sources as well as everyone who contributed to this product project through taking imagery or ground true thing and I would like to thank Ross and June Fargo for access to the nolpinia national park on their property and acknowledge that this land lies within the item on a traditional lands and again there's the QR code for the life RCN thanks okay fantastic Rachel do we have any questions see this hand came up first I think uh I was wondering and first of all thank you for a great talk uh I was wondering does anything about those Ripples and texture or any other factors change um over the course of the Precambrian it's like are there any connections like major events like oxygenation or other things and if so like can we infer anything can we infer any like make any past climate inferences for something like Mars this is a really good question and talk to me after I finish my postdoc I will anyone else so I'm wondering if there's any images from Mars that this can be applied to now or we just have to reorient the cameras to sort of start doing that there are definitely images that this can be applied to it like that's kind of why I'm like harping on this bio signature because it's like most of our imagery we're getting is of cross sections from the Martian surface um so yeah where once we have the classifier we're going to start running them through from what I've seen just like looking at them I don't see anything um that would look like it but it's an experiment we need to run I I was just wondering I wondering if you guys were using any kind of like uh like depth data uh for this because it feels like the these uh sort of in the images that looked very like quite 3D and you know if you have like two images yeah so we did we did um take that into consideration kind of looking at the the depth of the images and it didn't really change um kind of the performance of the program so I believe it's incorporated into it but it's not a huge aspect of it thank you yeah we're going to take one more over here oh Mike is itching to ask a question hi interesting talk kind of similar um have you ever thought about applying this to like maybe like um debated diagnostic like bio faces that are in the fossil record like um just as additional Earth constraints I'm not quite clear on what you're like um just similar like at least other like sure matter later microbial systems that like have debated like um sources yeah that's a really interesting question um no so this is like specifically developed just for like this one feature um I think it is work that other people are doing that are not me um but yeah there's definitely other like computer vision programs that have been developed to identify similar features thank you all right we're gonna let Mike ask a question he's been working hard for us back here okay this is actually my question not online um I'm just curious uh if you did see something on Mars what would you need to actually confirm that could you do it visually or would you need sample return or yeah that's a really good question I'm from my perspective I think it's like a first pass ID I think like there's it is a definitive bio signature but I wouldn't never want to just like say oh space egg 2.0 said there's like a 99 chance and that's definitive evidence I think um yeah sample return or like further analysis of um that section would be needed to like really definitively say anything foreign thank you Rachel our next speaker is John Malloy from Arizona State University thank you um yeah I'm here to talk about a different kind of biosignature um kind of introduce assembly Theory I don't know if this is the right group to be very controversial about it with or if you guys all accept it so we're gonna we're gonna see what happens um but mostly the main reason I'm a fan of this Theory the reason really talked about it is that there's two major problems that is currently in the field of astrobiology at least from my opinion um the first one is that we don't have a universal definition of life um again not sure if you guys agree with this or if that's really controversial no idea um but honestly we don't know what we're looking for out elsewhere and because of that kind of the biochemistry that we see or could potentially see we have no idea what that could look like comparison on Earth so kind of what we need to do is find a universal pattern of life first and then build our detection methods based on that um I think going out there seeing what we see is incredibly useful incredibly interesting but then you end up with like a phosphine problem of how do we explain what we see um if we determine what we're looking for first and then build a method based on that Universal Property we're able to be a little more stringent a little more um a little more robust about what we're actually finding so given that given that kind of solution um the basic idea of assembly theory is that life produces complex things for example if we were to go to Enceladus and find an iPhone sitting on the bottom of the ocean um somehow unless Steve Jobs flew on a plane and put it there um we would say something Enceladus made a complex thing made it made an iPhone um that's weird that's interesting that would certainly be a really interesting bio signature um especially if we saw thousands of them if it was littered in iPhones there'd be some kind of process on Enceladus that would create and select for a complex object so it's kind of idea is that life makes complex things it makes a lot of them and what assembly Theory does is specifically measure that give a measure of the complexity you can measure of how much memory is um part of the system that makes something really complex in a lot of it so kind of what this is what we're talking about is specifically it's a number of joining steps required to build an object from a base set of fragments that's a lot of words that's really confusing um so start with Legos and we'll go up from there if you were to make this thing like this big Square rectangle whatever thing you would start with this green and green and red block and you would start joining them together in the most optimal way possible essentially the way that minimizes the joining steps to make that thing at the end um specifically there's five of them here you notice that you reuse this double a couple times and you reuse the square once as well so you're able to reuse the thing you already make there's five joining steps the ma of this particular Lego block will be five um and you can do this for lots of different things you can do this for Strings like Gage was talking about um yesterday where if you want to make Abracadabra you're going to have a number of steps particularly seven you're going to reuse Abra along the way and you can do this for chemicals which is kind of more astrological relevant um you're able to start with your base fragments in this case it's a element a bond and a different element which is defined by the thing you're looking for and you're able to build up the steps along the way I think one thing I want to emphasize is that these steps don't necessarily have any physical meaning like this window guy isn't maybe maybe you can't make this in a lab who knows um and it doesn't particularly matter for this metric um this is not what I'm saying this is a physical property it's a theoretical way of reusing the symmetry of the object that you're ending up with so kind of keep that in mind um when you're doing this this is all from paper in 2021 from Stuart Marshall and Cole Mathis both at the University of Glasgow and we're able to do ma over a ton of things um it unsurprisingly correlates with molecular weights because as things get bigger you get more steps to make them but it's not a one to one ratio there's a lot of things kind of here that are high molecular weight below assembly Theory because they have high symmetry um so they're not necessarily as complex they require less steps to make um just again keep that in mind and the reason why we're so excited about this the reason why we want to use this for an astrobiological signature is that when you look at these compounds in a mass spec um you're able to see a lot of these different Peaks a mass spec takes a compound fragments it based on ionization a lot of different things there's lots of ways to do it this one particularly was an orbitrap so if fragments things twice and you end up with a number of different Peaks now kind of notice as a correlation the lower things the lower ma things the less complex things don't have as many Peaks as the higher complex things um again kind of make sense bigger things are more complex there's a really strong correlation between the two which is really really exciting again it's not intuitively obvious that you have a theoretical measure that has no correlation in physical reality actually corresponds to a mass spec signature um so when we saw this we kind of ran with this and we're saying hey we can put a mask back in space we've done it before we've done it since the 1970s so why don't we look at what kind of mass specs are needed think about ma as a specific bio signature and then use Mass Spec to go out and find it and the thing we're looking for specifically again from this 2021 paper is that all of biochemistry has an MA greater than 15. um anything below 15 leads to see on Earth is a mixture of biotic abiotic things they're found throughout the geosphere and everything but above 15 is only things made by things that we know are alive um like whiskey a few other things they kind of had some phono Glasgow measuring a bunch of stuff but essentially anything above 15 what we say is hey this from what we know about life on Earth let's extrapolate it to be a universal property that's something that's complex um for the rest of the talk I think just 15 it might be a little fuzzy I also measured 20. um I consider 20 as about as about as a specific bio signature so you'll see two numbers later on um that's where the 20 comes from is just give it a little wiggle room so now the issue with that if we're going to send a mass back into space it needs to be high resolution um you can't have something like this where you only have a couple Peaks you need something that has the right number of peaks in order to find something that's high and complex um if you find something send something that's low resolution it's not going to be good enough um so and when we look at stuff today you'll see this chart a couple times so we want to explain it real fast this is essentially um M over Z ratio essentially a measure of how big the molecule is and this is the mass resolution of the particular objects times 10 000. um all of these ones off here are off the chart like they just have really have Big M over Z ratios and these two would have a really high resolution um so this is good now these things take up rooms um like an orbitrap it's not that big but you need a bunch of vacuum stuff like it's about as big as this Podium roughly if you want a really good one um you can't just launch that on a spaceship that's like it's really mad when you want something that big so how do we like the stuff we do today is roughly down here um Ricky yaravalo's group in University of Maryland College Park um has this mini orbitrap that's decent but still like not still on that scale um so how could how could can we get how is that good enough how much do we need in order to determine definitively that you have a mass spec signal stick signature um so what we did we did some chemical enumeration we built some graphs um specifically built some formulas and said hey given a specific number of chemicals this case Zero to six carbons any number of hydrogens then nitrogen oxofhosphorus sulfur how many different formulas do we get how big is the chemical space that could potentially be out there um answer is pretty big you get lots of different formulas unsurprising um they can be modeled with a normal normal curve so I can do this for any number of upper limit and any number like up to 10 atoms up to five atoms if I want to measure more I can do a different normal curve um now this next slide might trigger people I apologize um I did random chemistry based on that because again we don't know what that is going to look like um so I built random I built random structures from random formulas essentially building putting random bonds together um this might not exist this probably doesn't exist anywhere but um I kind of hope it doesn't because that would be weird um but what we what we did is we built it we put it through RG kits 3D and better software so we know this is at least physically possible it doesn't break the rules of physics the thermodynamics are really weird who knows how long this lasts but again our assumptions we don't know what this looks like um and this actually is a good assumption you'll see a few graphs later that we're not actually that far off from reality but um just bear with me for now so I did this for 10 000 different structures um made a bunch of made a bunch of random chemicals and found the m a of them so we have molecular weights we have assembly index and you see that most of them started to get high m a and you get a likelihood very quickly of well what is the likelihood of finding a high m a object at a particular molecular weight so we have a number we have a size of chemical space we have molecular weights and we know how often those things are high m a we're essentially able to then put that on a Precision curve and say what's the Precision which can be translated into resolution of the particular number of chemical species that have a high ma in that case or that particular M over Z ratio we take the integral of that particular line our goal is to find 10 or fewer just to put a number on it and then we end up with something looks like this um so our in an ideal case what we have is something about 552 000 um M over Delta M Mass resolution Which is far fewer than what we have in commercial orbitraps those are on the orders like Millions 10 Millions um but it's not what we've sent to space it's about four times better than what we've sent the space so far um those ones we sent so those ones set into space are decent like in this little curve here they're good they're able to determine High m a molecules but we still want to get as high up on this graph as possible um so it's more of an engineering challenge this is more saying hey Engineers if you can go out and build something like this give an unknown chemical space we're confident that you'll be able to detect a high ma molecule if it's out there um and quickly just to finish up um I know the chemicals were really bad and really not Earth like um so we determine our spacecraft our sermon our resolution based on existing chemistry we used keg keto Encyclopedia of genes of genomes I'm mostly saying how good is our prediction based on those random chemicals um this is MOMA this is the one that's launching soon to Mars um it's not that great at distinguishing formulas um there's a lot of overlaps but if you look at something like corals or our recommended one you're not you're really not that bad you're getting maximum of five so it's pretty good um and even better when we start saying hey does random chemistry correspond with reality um it does thankfully um kind of as a test we took 200 formulas from that form of enumeration um got a hundred different isomers of those formulas both from Pub chem so existing chemistry GDB which from John Louise Raymond's group and burn which is a generated database of potential chemistry here on Earth and then random structure generation like we did and if they were separate we'd say we have a problem but all of these kind of the ma space of all those chemicals is about the same so we actually end up roughly a recommendation on random chemistry seems to be sufficient based on life we see today um so kind of a recommendation if we take this melt blacker assembly Theory as a biosignature we have a mass range of mass specs to shoot for we have a resolution and it's a worst case scenario and what we're showing is that this roughly represents m a of chemical space um there's lots of people to thank um mostly the ASU group that is mostly sitting at the front table so thank you very much thank you John any questions felt all freaked out by the chemistry hi great talk um I'm wondering why is the random set smaller on the area that it takes than a pumpkin yeah um that is a that's a great question um I think my answer is that it's possibly a sampling issue of random space is probably bigger but the density of different compounds that it could sample in random chemistry is just so high on that little part right there like I'm just not sampling enough to get a distribution um or or or I am and I'm not um getting the edges as much um I think it's interesting question of how life can be a little more spread out I think there's an interesting function a functionality argument going on um I think yeah random chemistry I think it's so dense in the middle that I'm just not exploring the edges as well as I could be thanks hi uh this is very very interesting so um I guess would you mind uh maybe going over the um uh basically what led you to your resolution and um and uh Max M over Z calculations a little bit uh I guess more in detail uh about how that connects to um msms uh measurements is is this um just with M over Z or okay yeah so um yeah it's a great question so I'm not assuming any fragmentation here um mostly because we don't know exactly what we're going to send or if it's an ms1 or MS2 machine um so I'm just assuming that there's a there's a particular structure it's ionized so I knock off a hydrogen and then that's a single Peak that you get what's the resolution to distinguish those Peaks um which one thing is worst case add fragmentation and add like a really add a decent orbitrap and this probably becomes a lot better but it's hard to predict exactly what that fragmentation is um there's a team in Glasgow um led by Emma chiric that's like trying to figure that out right now um as you can imagine it's a difficult like Mass specs are weird um it's a difficult problem to predict and extrapolate yeah because I guess I'm wondering you know obviously um ion neutral Mass spectrometer and Cassini did not have nearly this resolution uh but if the fragmentation that you can assume happened when those ice creams collided with it um could be assumed to be an MS2 like event then and if that you know if MS2 makes it that much better then maybe you could look at it from this perspective yeah no I didn't I think if we hadn't I think I would love to see a number of how much that correlates um yeah I think that's the I think that's probably the next step on where to go with this yeah absolutely okay uh we could probably take one more question and you're the lucky man right next to me it's a very interesting talk uh you talked about the lower limit on Ma is there any upper limit on Ma so like up a little bit of how far biochemistry can go yeah um it's a great question so it quickly so we're using it so far in small small molecules we're not using this in peptides or anything mostly because the base fragments that we're talking about in this case are elements to bonds and we talked like something like DNA molecule then Things become so massive so massive that since it's an NP complex NP complete problem if that'll take forever to compute um so I think like It's Quickly depends on your definition of a base fragment and what you want your what you want those joining steps to be um it's essentially DNA I imagine would be in tens of millions if not higher if we're using this particular definition for using amino acids or base pairs Things become a little different um I have some interesting results in like patent chemistry that I'm happy to share afterwards to show like we have a little bit of upper limit of like what chemistry can look like but um I mean that's more of a computational limit than anything thanks a lot yeah absolutely thank you John um the extra guys go find him in the break because I know you have awesome questions for him up next we have Macy Houston she's coming from Penn State University hello um my name is Macy Houston um I'm sort of a fifth year grad student at Penn State um in astronomy as you may have guessed from my background um but I just successfully defended my thesis last week so I've gone ahead and assumed I don't get my diploma and start my post back until August but I'm still going to call myself Dr Houston now um so I'm going to be talking about something that was not in my thesis so I hadn't thought about too much for a couple months but I'm getting back to it now um this is some work I'm doing as part of the Penn State extraterrestrial Intelligence Center and um this work is actually being led by Dr Sophia shake at The seti Institute so um this project came out of a group a collaboration called characterizing atmospheric techno signatures uh or cats which I'm very glad we found a good abbreviation for and um so what this group is doing is just kind of creating a library of possible techno signatures and especially focusing on atmospheric techno signatures as jwst launches and we're making a lot of advances in our ability to characterize exoplanet atmospheres um but this project we're talking about today actually goes a bit more abroad than that and we're thinking of all the Techno signatures that we produce here on Earth so the project we're calling Earth detecting Earth is establishing benchmarks for detectability based on how strong our techno signatures we produce here on Earth are and how a far away um we you would be able to use our telescopes to successfully detect our techno signatures so um this is a very preliminary version of our plot here we're going to have more techno signatures than this and we still have to finish up a few calculations to get all our distances right but um we're basically just trying to calculate the detectable distance for our telescopes to observe our techno signatures for all of the Techno signatures that we could think of that humans produce so um this is related to a similar concept called the ignoscale which was proposed by so cast novaro at all a couple years ago this term is defined as these relative size or intensity of a techno signature in units of the same type no signature as produced by Earth's technology so kind of the first step in our project is to quantify the strength of Earth's current day techno signatures and this is kind of defining the power level that is an ignoscale value of one and then we're going to determine what distance we can use our technology to detect those technical signatures and to keep things kind of uniform among all detective signatures we're looking at we're adopting a signal noise ratio of five but we're also going to talk a bit about scaling relations you can use if you want to get higher signal to noise or something like that so I'm just gonna gonna go through a few of our calculations here um oh I don't know why it's covering my oh well so uh the first kind of technical signature I want to talk about is intermittent celestially targeted radio Transmissions um so the types of signals that would produce this are um Medi signals so intentional messages that we have sent out ostensibly to communicate with extraterrestrial life but we don't really do a lot of that so um the more common types of signals we send out are powerful radio signals targeted at planets and asteroids in the solar system in order to characterize them with radar so for our calculation we are assuming that our radar transmitter is Arecibo Rip but um our Observer for radio observations we are using the currently under construction square kilometer array if we assume assume an observation time of one hour then we get our Earth detecting Earth detectable distance of 12 000 light years for our most powerful radio signals so this is the highest number that we're going to see in terms of our distances here but I wanted to start with it to really emphasize that um I see techno signatures as a really important part of the search for biosignatures because when you think about all of the signs of life that we produce here on Earth our radio signals are by far the most detectable thing that we produce so I really hope that the fields of biosignatures detective signatures can work closely together because I think we want to take as many approaches as possible to find any types of life we can in the universe so the next category of techno signature is just another type of radio signal intermittent celestially untargeted leakage so these are signals that we intentionally send into the sky but not necessarily with the aim of going to space so things like Military and Commercial aircraft radar we're just kind of assuming the standard aircraft radar systems for a transmitter and again observing with the square kilometer array and our Earth attacking earth distance is a bit over 200 light years so this is still a pretty big distance this includes quite a number of stars um if we're considering you know the Stars within this distance range uh the next Technic signature I want to talk about is persistent omnidirectional radio leakage so there was some early work done on this topic actually in 1989 where um Sullivan at all simulated um the output of Earth's television Tower Transmissions as you might be able to observe them from space and concluded that it's possible that other life out in the universe knows that we're here um our TV signals aren't quite as powerful now as they were in the peak a time but we've got all kinds of mobile cell phone towers all over the world now so there's a really great paper that just came out a few weeks ago by Mira Sade at all um that kind of does a similar calculation to the Sullivan paper but using mobile phone towers instead of television so we adopted their value of a transmitter strength of four gigawatts and again using the square kilometer array as our radio detector and we got a detectable distance of just under a light year so this is a little bit too short of a distance to reach any nearby stars um but it's getting pretty close and as radio technology improves this kind of uh thing is going to become more feasible um the next techno signature I want to talk about is intermittent targeted laser leakage so these are laser signals that we happen to be sending out into space so for the non astronomers in the room um the example that I want to use here is Adaptive Optics lasers Adaptive Optics is an astronomy technique where you take ground based telescopes and distort their mirrors and in order to account for the effects of the atmosphere on the light that we observed from space and uh there are kind of a lot of factors that goes into that but one thing is that sometimes we need to create an artificial guide star to calibrate these and so what we do is send really powerful lasers shooting into the atmosphere so that's some amount of that laser power hits the atmosphere and bounces back for us to observe while a lot of that laser power just happens to go out into space wherever it's headed so um for our calculation for laser leakage we use the Keck 10 meter telescope and it's of Adaptive Optics system and we get a detectable distance of about 10 layers so this distance does include a few nearby stars but it's important to note that we're not actually directing these lasers at any nearby stars because you only need to use Adaptive Optics um the laser artificial guide star if you don't have a real well known bright star you can look at so we're never really doing that right at nearby Stars which would be pretty bright so the next category of techno signatures I want to get into are um exoplanetary techno signatures that you might detect for example in our in the atmosphere of a planet so we've got an example here of one possible atmospheric pollutant which is nitrogen dioxide and this is based on work done by kaparapu at all a couple years ago so this simulation was performed using the planetary Spectrum generator and assuming that our Observer is a luvex which I guess is now called habitable worlds Observatory um which is a space mission that's under development but is the combination of luvar and have exhibition Concepts that was for a few months called lubex but now this is already out of date so um our detectable distance here is a little over three light years so this includes some nearby stars um but it's important to know that NO2 can also be created through natural means so there's a lot of complicated chemistry at play here to determine whether it's actually artificial but a really important thing about the Cathedral at spheric pollution signatures is that you can use the same observations to search for techno signatures and biosignatures when you're looking at the Spectra so I think it's a really great way that these two techniques can work together um and then the last techno signature I'm going to talk about is City Lights so I'm showing a picture here of Earth as each part of the world appears at night with City Lights so for this calculation we're using some work done by Thomas Beatty where he assumes that our lights are primarily from high pressure sodium lamps in this simulation our Observer is luvore a so a slightly earlier version of the lubex I talked about last time Lou Barre was an earlier Mission concept concept for that so this exact design is not going to be launched in space but we're going to have something similar and our distance for this one is only 0.075 light years so this means um you that we could only use something like luvor to detect our city lights if we're in the Oort cloud which is just kind of the outer regions of the solar system um so if you want to detect this kind of thing you're going to have to uh have a planet that has a lot more lights than we do and so um I'll just kind of leave up my summary slide here as the list of the Techno signatures that we're looking at um the first few on the list here are the ones that we quickly went over I've got a few more highlighted in yellow and for those our calculations are still underway and then we've crossed a few out um that turned out to be techno signatures we've crossed off of um consideration for various reasons mostly because it's just not feasible to observe them from space at all we'd be talking about still in Earth's atmosphere for our distance or because um another possible techno signature is observing the contents of Earth's atmosphere over time and how it changes but we decided for this project that we're not going to get into things that are based on changes over time because uh this is already a really big paper as is um so yeah I can take questions I also have my email and Twitter up there all right thank you Macy our new doctor Houston um unfortunately we only have time for one question so I want to see some real enthusiasm I really hi um thank you so much for your talk I definitely agree with you that take my signature and my signature scientists need to work more closely together um I was wondering I know the paper is already super cool as it is but as a sort of follow up um would it be possible to estimate what sort of techno signal like how those techno signatures would evolve um in the future and if there's one that's going to shoot up and at what point in our future uh would we be detectable to most terrestrial planets in our galaxy yeah we'll talk a little bit about that in the discussion but we're not going to get too quantitative um but that is something that comes up as in you know uh one of the main things you hear people talk about this in is is like radio leakage because like if our cell phone towers were more directed you know down at the Earth they could be more efficient and maybe more advanced technology has less leakage into space just because it's a waste of energy um so yeah these are things we think about I don't have any definitive answers right now thanks [Applause] okay our final speaker no pressure is Evan Smith come on up

we're going to get started uh our second keynote speaker of the conference holds the Chancellor's distinguished profession professorship in physics at UCSD he's a theoretical physicist whose work is wide ranging and whose Twitter bio says I'm interested in everything before joining UCSD he was at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign for over 30 years where he led the bio complexity group within the Carl R woes Institute for genomic biology and where he both founded and directed the NASA astrobiology Institute for Universal biology his research has been highly multidisciplinary ranging from condensed matter and hydrodynamics to the ecology and evolution of living systems among his many accolades Nigel received the 2020 leop kadenoff prize from the American physical Society for quote profound contributions to the fields of superconductivity fluid turbulence and dynamical pattern formation it's been a pleasure to have him as a professor and it's a pleasure to have him with us here today please welcome Nigel goldenfeld foreign invitation to speak at the at Brad Khan um I love this conference I've sent my students to it I've been in it before I think it's absolutely wonderful and I was really thrilled to see that NASA is still supporting it and even to uh to uh to catch up with an old friend in class and acquaintance for my days at the NASA astrobiology Institute hi Mike so I'm going to talk about something that that by all right shouldn't exist and I don't mean life itself um I mean uh Universal aspects of living systems I'm a physicist as you heard from the introduction and so my approach to anything is is ridiculously as simple and is almost surely destined for failure but we try to fail in a in a grand way and at least see what we can learn from our attempts to understand uh the physical principles that govern uh life so I'm going to talk about Universal biology the genetic code in the first billion years of life on Earth and I have uh collaborators my first collaborate I want to mention is uh Carl woes who will feature in this story and many of you may know Carl was he discovered the Arca he was a very famous evolutionary biologist and he was my mentor when I started doing biology about 20 years ago I was one of my graduate students who did a fantastic work on the generic code and was in fact also at the uh University of Wisconsin where Alex was as a as a student before um uh Apache Jaffa Paul is now uh as a in in the Netherlands and tomato bianchalani is now working in a genotech here in California all right so I'm going to tell you about work that was done uh over the last uh 10 or 10 or 15 years or so through the NASA astrobiology Institute and I hope you're going to find it interesting if you have any questions feel free to interrupt during the during the talk especially if it's a clarification and I'll be of course be happy to take questions as as we go through to the end so the thing I want to understand is what are the sorts of evolutionary transitions that life must inevitably pass through this is part of a program that the NASA uh discussed in The Marvelous astrobiology road map from about 15 years ago trying to understand a universal biology and look for Universal characteristics of life and the idea is if we can understand what features of life on Earth are not idiosyncratic but actually just something that we should expect from another planet and understanding these processes understanding these transitions may help us to come up with uh biosignatures and we'll see that in fact there are some prospects for that so I want to understand basically can we understand some features of Life Universal features which you may say may not exist but we'll see we'll see it's the country and can we understand from general dynamical principles without necessarily having to worry about all the chemical details so I'm going to talk about two things in this talk I'm going to talk about uh the canonical genetic code and that's going to be most the most of my talk I will talk about biological homochoality because it is important as a as a biosignature it's been assumed to be a biosignature but um but actually we'll see in this talk that actually there are dynamical reasons for thinking that homocolity isn't inevitable outcome of living systems so I want to first start off though by talking about are there any universal features in biology and and how should we think about them so I'm a physicist so I start off by asking is there universality in physics so here's an example this is thermal conductivity or various uh glassy materials this is raw data and then when we process it in a certain way the data from different materials all collapse onto one uh Universal curve except for this regime over here and so that's something that we try to understand if we want to understand glassy materials here's another example which is a much better one this example is looking at the magnetic field or the magnetization in a magnet exposed to an external magnetic field H at temperature t as you go through the ferromagnetic phase transition the transition that makes stuff be magnetic at low temperatures and not magnetic at high temperatures and you the data you take from a different external magnetic fields different uh temperatures and then if you process the data in the right way all these data from five different materials none of which are look anything alike all fall onto one universal curve and the prediction for that curve is the solid line which goes embarrassingly close to all the data and it has no adjustable parameters so that's another example of of scaling and universality in physics and you might say well this is this is really great because what did the physicists do they made a model of a magnetic system and then they took that model worked out its consequences did some calculations and then showed that it gave a precise prediction in agreement with experiments that's what physicists usually do in fact it's nothing like that at all well actually it is it's a model of a model of a model of a model of a model and that that does all the work the first model is a model of quantum chemistry then there's a model of electronic structure then there's a model of the dipole moment on the electronic spins that uses quantum mechanics and then you say well quantum mechanics is too hard so let's get rid of quantum mechanics so then you have a classical and you still can't do it and then you make some sort of approximation that physicism to call Landau Theory and then you you get the results that I showed you and the thing you want I want you to understand the reason why I'm uh tormenting you with this physics stuff is because every step along the way here is a non systematic approximation you cannot justify these approximations starting from first principles from the Schrodinger equation or whatever else it is so the point is here is an example of how a ludicrously simple model that has no right to actually be able to describe reality actually describes it precisely and we know in this case why it works it works in this case because of a thing called renormalization group Theory which Ken Wilson won the Nobel Prize for inventing in the 1980s and so we understand how all these approximations that we made throw away stuff that really doesn't matter for the thing that we were trying to calculate so that's the uh so that that tells you that it is not impossible to make ludicrously simple models and still have some understanding of how the system actually behaves okay so but we're going to of course apply that type of modeling philosophy to biology but first of all let's ask another question so for me as a physicist I want to know do we learn new physics when we study biology or is it just insanely complicated Material Science are they Universal phenomena do they reveal anything important and what do we miss by not understanding Universal phenomena okay I'm going to show you that there are Universal and some of you will be very surprised at the examples I'm going to show you I'm also going to show you that if we don't understand these Universal phenomena not only can we not understand how life started at all and how it evolved we certainly can't understand how to do things like respond to a pandemic or deal with antibiotic resistance or herbicide doesn't or Cancer all of these things depend on understanding Evolution and these Universal properties okay so let's talk about Universal biology so so uh let me give you an example here so this was a this was a headline on the NASA website at some point uh 2013 about 10 years ago mystery of the missing waves on Titan so basically people knew that from looking at the uh at uh the flow mechanics and and the atmosphere of Tito that there should be uh waves on on the surface of Titan um and uh and uh so there was a mystery they weren't there we couldn't see them nobody knew why and then about a year later uh Cassini Spies The wind rippled Waves uh on Titan so so suddenly side of relief thank goodness you you can sleep at night we found the waves on the surface of the oceans of Titan okay so that's a real real headline okay here's what here's one that you oh okay so I forget I forgot this we know the waves on the ocean of Titan are missing because there's a general theory of two phase fluid flow interfaces but predict waves and the dispersion characteristics so we knew what to look for okay here's a headline that you didn't see mystery of the missing life on Titan and then definitely not this one Cassini Spies The Long sort life on Titan okay anybody seen that headline it never occurred okay and it's a joke right because it's a joke because we don't know if there's a missing life because we don't have a theory that predicts the existence of Life as a physical phenomena so that's the first thing why does life as a phenomenon exist and we certainly don't understand what sort of Life can exist in different uh environments so so um so so so actually going back to going back to Cassini Cassini May indeed have actually seen life but not on Titan it may have seen life okay so how many people here know about encelados great a lot more a lot more people than would as a typical physics colloquium right so so good so so as you know insolidos is a is an isolated World orbiting Saturn um it has a global ocean of liquid water underneath the ice and we know that because we can see how it wobbles and because of the way it wobbles we can detect there must be life underneath but there must be water underneath and it also obligingly has a crack in the ice lots of cracks and so water squirts out through the cracks and so you've got a fountain a huge fountain and you can fly satellites through the fountain and you can look at the water that you uh that you pick up and that water you can analyze it's chemistry and its chemistry looks very similar to what we might see as an alkaline hydrothermal vent here on Earth so we Cassini wasn't instrumented for looking at life but we may have seen some signatures of life through that experiment so what is universal biology well Universal biology is the idea that we are interested in general principles and not specific carbon chemistry details and so we want to develop a theory of universal biology divorced from idiosyncratic details of the actual chemistry and the and the geological context and so on and this will involve abstractions and and we use abstractions all the time in in biology and we'll talk about one of those in a minute so in this slide is pretty much all we know about Universal biology so are you looking at it carefully there's not much there so let's talk instead about something where we do have an understanding and that is universal computation so I wanted to tell you now about what we what a universal biology would look like if we could do it and we use as a Model A computer so here's a picture of my computer or something close to my computer here's another computer this one you can see a few hundred miles up the road at the Museum of computation in Mountain View or in my case I saw it at the science museum in London this is a computer made out of COG wheels and springs designed and partially built by George Babbage in the 1900s it is the authentic steampunk artifact these two things are the same they're the same algorithmically this thing over here the left hand side is a computer and you know that it's uh not uh just a shiny chunk of glass plastic and silicon it's actually a universal turing machine the thing on the right is also a2ing machine because it has conditional branching in its instruction set and so it can be shown that it can be mapped onto a universal turing machine so in fact the two things are the same although one of them is at many times faster than the other so a turing machine with an online architecture is really what a computer is and we have Hardware to instantiate that that algorithm so the medium is not the message here is a John Von Neumann standing in front of another computer that he built at The Institute for advanced study in the 1950s in this computer it's built out of thermionic valves it's built out of relays and switches so neither this nor this we're seeing here the evolution of computational Hardware but in all of these machines they all do the same thing they're all Universal Turing machines and so we're looking at life we should be thinking about life as making a progression as you see over here but executing the same sort of algorithmic processes now there's a new physical laws in in biology well schrodigo and Dell Brooke were the first physicists to work in biology and their partial motivation was to find new physical laws they were thinking about quantum mechanics in the 1930s as they might see some deviations from quantum mechanics or something like that but today we not many people well some people think that could be still true but most of us think that uh the real big question is trying to understand emergence and the existence of life itself how is it that matter that molecules and atoms are self organize hierarchically create replicating and evolvable structures we don't have a clue about how that happens how do molecules come to life so if you want to understand biology in the same way that we understand physical phenomena we need to understand the existence and not just the specific realization of of living systems and I'm going to take the perspective here that living systems are dynamical systems that are able to reprogram themselves so let's think about that so here is the uh here is the fortune cookie the program is the data the data is the program okay this is Niels barricelli who was uh the first person to write a computer virus he was working at The Institute for advanced study and in the day while John Von Neumann was using the computer one of the first computers to solve the equations of hydrodynamics to design hydrogen bombs uh Niels bandicelli went in at night and made a computer viruses and then had them compete and and evolve with each other inside a fixed ecosystem which was the memory of the of the computer and he he understood what he was seeing here uh was uh was actually meaning of the phenomena that we see in evolving uh evolvable ecosystems so what do self programming systems uh can do well living systems have the capacity to evolve and evolving systems can reprogram themselves so they're able to respond to perturbations by creating new functionality that is the defining characteristic of living systems and this is very different from physical systems or engineered systems which are by a fixed or predetermined uh equation of motion or or behavior so the future state of an evolvable system is inherently unpredictable and maybe good undecidable don't worry about that and so this this uh this this feature means that it's very difficult to control evolving systems and we'll come to that we'll turn to that at the end of The Talk now what do most biologists do well most biologists do something rather strange you could call it the inverse problem imagine that you came down from Mars and I gave you my computer and you had no idea what this thing was what would you be able to do to figure out that this thing is not just an expensive door stop but actually as a universal turing machine with a Von Wyman architecture it will be very very different very very difficult to figure out from the electronic circuits and the hardware and so on but that's what the thing actually did and so what we want to do in biology is we have the inverse problem the biology is already created and we want to understand what is the abstract theory of which it is an instantiation and that abstract Theory would underline all systems that exhibit the characteristics of life so could you could you if you didn't know about the universal Turing machines with a Von Wyman architecture could you deduce a theoretical framework just by somebody giving you a highly evolved computer okay we've talked about abstraction so now let's get down to a real abstraction so I want to talk about the genetic code and I figuratively find that people uh from various wide ranging audiences don't quite know what I mean when I talk about the genetic code so let's just take a pause uh to uh to go through that so in the modern world as you know uh DNA contains our genome the DNA is built from four nucleotide bases RNA polymerase reads uh the the gene coding segments some spits out uh mRNA that's also built from four nucleotide bases and then the ribosomes go along the MRNA and they spit out the proteins and they choose which proteins should go into the protein sorry if you choose which amino acids should go into the proteins from the code that they're reading from the from the MRNA and the way they read that code is they read it in triplets so aug ACA ggt and so on these are codon Triplets of of nucleotide bases and the genetic code it tells you if you read this thing here what amino acid is going to go into the into the protein that you're building and so this is a sort of cartoon here of the whole translation process and you're supposed to think of this huge machine moving along like so [Applause] so just to summarize what the genetic code is it's a map it's a map used by the ribosome to translate the message from A1A Triplets of four bases into the 20 amino acids of life and uh and and we're going to discuss uh how that code evolved now this is Carl Rose sitting uh in his office on and on the New York Times front page Thursday November the 3rd 1977. why is he there well it says here scientists discover a form of life that predates higher organisms um I guess uh fake news is not just a new invention it happened uh it happened back in the 70s as well this is partially true not not not not quite true but in any case he had discovered uh the uh the archaea so let me just tell you uh what he had discovered so this is the tree of life this is from a paper by Norm Pace in 97 now you can see here there are three domains the bacteria the archaea and the eukaryotes you are over here but actually everything else here is is microbial and uh the and this this this phylogenetic tree is a kind of map it's built it's been elaborated on by now and there's there's uh it's it's out of date and there's uh some debates about whether there's two domains or three domains and so on and so forth but fundamentally this is what uh what he discovered now how did he uh how did he discover this well what he did was looked for patterns in uh in in molecular sequences from parts of the ribosome the 16s small subunit of the ribosome and by looking at those sequences was able to look at do the what what today would call comparative genomics and map out uh the the this tree of life and some around here is uh the last Universal common ancestor or the last Universal common ancestral community so this is the paper that they wrote in in 1977 and uh the the mystery that this uh this this work um uh left us with is the following we know that the planet is about 4.6 billion years old we know that the the last Universal common ancestor even then was uh was dated to at least three billion years today we think it's about 3.6 3.8 billion years depending on who you're talking to based on uh static um you know um um what do you call them um you know if they're various geological evidence and and so on for matalites and so on um so so basically but something like this but but the point that that woes and fox were making is that a lot of the of the time the planet was inhospitable to life you had less than a billion years in which life could evolve and it evolved the complexity of something like the modern cell in less than the billion years and then after that there wasn't very much cellular Evolution maybe dinosaurs and multicellularity and things like that but from a point of view of the architecture of the cell uh very little so so what uh What uh uh woes and fox uh here's some pictures of them doing their work at the time uh what they what they uh what they wrote was that uh that it wasn't that the evolution speeded up at the beginning and then slowed down uh the last Universal common ancestor what they wrote was that actually maybe Evolution had a different character um in its early phases and we're going to see that there is evidence for that now what kind of different mode could there be of evolution well most of us when you think about Evolution you think about what is really called vertical Evolution that is you have your genes you give your genes to your children they give their genes to their children and so on and so forth and so there's a a transfer of genetic material of genes through the generations horizontal Gene transfer is a is a different thing altogether horizontal team transfer is the transfer of genes from one organism to another that it is not related to and I and this is uh this is what happens uh in in bacteria there's three ways that this can known to happen here on Earth genes can be transmitted through viruses through direct contact or through uptake of free DNA from the environment so the question is what happens when all the all the microbes in the world do this what happens when all of early life is able to uh to transfer genes okay let me just give you two quick uh anecdotes about that so this here is a cyanophage it's a it's a phase that's in in facts uh prochlorococcus one of the most abundant organisms of the planet and uh and and this here is a is a phylogenetic tree of the of a gene that is involved in the in photosystem too and if you can read phylogenetic trees it doesn't matter if you can't but if you can read them what this shows you is that this Gene was transferred back and forth between a virus and the bacterial host multiple times during evolution and in fact the the the group that discovered this sort of a little in penitism's lab they wrote that to host like genes acquired by phages undergo a period of diversification and phase genomes and serve as a genetic reservoir for their hosts so the idea is I have a gene that is a photosynthesis Gene that that Gene helps her in photosynthesis that Gene gets transferred by a viral attack to phage in phage that Gene can evolve much more rapidly because there are less proof readings and things like this that go on in phage replication so as a result the bacteria are get infected by new genes from the phage but those genes have evolved much more rapidly in the phase than they would in the bacteria and so there's a there's a mechanism by which you could have rapid evolutionary change mediated by phage or by other mechanisms of horizontal Gene transfer and because that is a network effect it's extraordinarily efficient and uh and um I'm not going to have time to show you work that we did actually modeling that that whole process now this is the uh the uh with that having said that and told you about an other mode of transfer let me now tell you about the genetic code so here is the genetic code so the way you read it is like this you you and then the First Column up here so that brings you to this cell that's phenylalanyl in and you can do the same thing for all of these of course it's a it's a it's a code of triplets of for a nucleotide basis in alphabet of four so in principle there are 64 things you could code for but there's only 20 amino acids so the code is redundant and uh but it's not just redundant it also has structure so if you look here these are the most hydrophobic amino acids these are the most hydrophilic ones and you can see that in the way that this code is written there is structure here the amino acids have are segmented in this in this uh in this genetic code table so one of the things that Carl was did back in the 1960s was to measure a quantity that he called polar acquirement which measured this balance between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity and gave a single number which is small up over here and large over here and and so he was able to quantify that chemical difference now you all know that the genetic code is pretty much Universal it's not exactly Universal there's small variations and stop codons but it's basically Universal but what I want to tell you now is something that you may not know about and that is that the genetic code is pretty much optimal in minimizing errors okay so let's let's uh let's discuss what we mean by that so let's suppose that you were given the task of of Designing intelligently a genetic code okay well you might say well translation is fundamentally important to a cellular operation so we want to make sure that any any mistakes any mutations or any misreadings give you an amino acid which is pretty close in clinical properties to the one that you should have got and if you could design a code like that then then that would be great okay it would be robust to errors so the question is is our genetic code like that I'm going to show you that it is so here's the actual genetic code so what you can do is you can make in the computer alternative genetic codes just by permuting the labels so here I'm permuting the label so I get new codes I'll be it with the same pattern of degeneracy there's 20 factorial which is about 10 to the 18 possible genetic code that you could have in the computer okay so now I can say all right I've made this whole Suite of genetic codes how good are they at minimizing errors and uh and there's a way that you can you can compute that and I'm not going to go into the exact metric that one uses so there's a way that one can do that so then one can ask well what should be the output if we take all our genetic codes that we've constructed in the computer measure how good they are at minimizing hours and then plot the probability distribution how many times we see a particular code with a particular score and minimizing errors and the smaller the the number here is on the horizontal axis the better the code is at minimizing error okay so one possibility that you could have is something like this you've got some you know Bells roughly bell shaped curve and uh and then you that's what you would get for any random genetic code and then you look at the actual genetic code it happens to be here in the middle in this in this sketch and so you would say okay well if that's what happens then that means that the current genetic code is just a frozen accident there were some ancestral organism it by accident it happens to be the one that we're all descended from all life on Earth it had some genetic code we all have the same genetic code as it because if we had a different genetic code then we'd be mistranslating our genomes we'd be getting the wrong amino acids and the wrong proteins and so we wouldn't survive and so the code must be what Francis Crick in 1968 called a frozen accident it's an accident because it just comes from whatever was the last Universal common ancestor and it's frozen because if it evolves the changes that it would happen would be deadly well the other option is something like this you've got a bell shaped curve like this and then the atrogenetic code is somewhere down here in the Tails and if that's true then that says heck the genetic code that we have is not a frozen accident it had to have evolved so here are the data this was a these are data taken from an experiment that was done by freelance Hearst in 1998 so they they generated 1 million genetic codes and they scored them in a way they're like I'm not going to go into in detail and the actual genetic code is way way down here in the tail so all these random codes look nothing like this actual universal genetic code the canonical genetic code and so the title of their paper was the genetic code is one in a million okay generate a million genetic codes and and they're all worse than the one that we actually have at minimizing translation hours actually we know that actually it's actually more more like a hundred times uh better than that okay so now we have to ask the question how did the genetic code get like this how is it possible for the code to evolve because Florence is quick already told us that it can't evolve if you so if you change the genetic code you're going to start making the wrong amino acids you make wrong amino acids you make the wrong proteins everything dies so we have to figure out how to do it and and this is what we did in this paper over here and I want to walk you through not I'm not going to go into any of the the modeling and the math and so on I want to give you a feel of how we can understand how it is possible for a code to evolve okay so we're going to do a thought experiment and we're going to do the thought experiment by involving in our little story here the experts on codes who are the experts on codes spies you're right foreign and possibly success 1960s TV shows all right so we're going to do an experiment which involves uh these spies and we're going to imagine that the spies of course have their secret code book so there's their code book and the spies are trying to communicate with uh one disreputable member of their Community shown here on the right and so we're going to do a thought experiment about what can happen when one spy tries to talk to to the other so let's start off with a with a message which is emitted over here so this is the message that she wants to send that is a received by by uh the the person on the right uses their code book and they correctly decode it as as uh as that sequence of uh of amino acids so so far everything is good there's only a single message that you can deduce from this signal that you receive okay so this is the standard operating procedure for the person on the right was chosen not just for their for their glamorous sartorial Style but for the fact that they're very uh um incompetent and so I want you to imagine that this person has lost half the code book and so the code has now been uh changed because you've missed half the code button so now he translates it as E equals m c squared which means nothing to him but it may mean something to to you and so what we've learned from this is that if you evolve or change the code in this case by losing half the code book the message gets garbled so so far Crick was right suppose however that we have a statistical code book not a code book that gives you one message but a code book that gives you an ensemble of messages and from those messages you look at them and you say that makes no sense that makes no sense that makes it says oh phenylalanolin okay great perfect this must be what they what they meant if you have a code plus it's context then if you if you just have a probabilistic code book you have a chance of being able to interpret the message so the idea then was that if you have a probabilistic code book then that means that you may you may need to have statistical proteins a process of translation that doesn't Just Produce one protein but produces many and this would make complete sense because think about early life think about early life which we know was uh was dominated by endosymbiosis and all sorts of events like that which of course led to many of the structures that we see in in modern cells uh like mitochondria and chloroplasts and so on so we can imagine that early life was a bit like early automobiles okay remember how early automobiles were they 100 years ago a bit more than that automobiles did not look like they do today they were rickety old things they were sort of held together by strings ceiling wax and if I drove over to one of my friends in my car and uh and then the wheel fell off you know she would just say well no problem I've got an old bicycle in the garage here we'll just screw on the wheel of that old bicycle onto your car and you'll go you're good to go thought you could do you could mix and match parts 100 years ago 120 years ago in the early class try to try doing that today to a to a Toyota Corolla right to taking a bicycle wheel and sticking it on when you've got a flat tire now it's not going to work at all modern cars are more highly evolved and so they're very intolerant of anything it is not exactly right and so we get the idea that evolved systems become very intolerant of any kind of ambiguity in what's present but systems that are very early on are very simple are able to tolerate ambiguity and uh and and and so uh you can have this idea that the codes are floppy that the statistical proteins that aren't made are not always the same proteins and then somehow the messages uh can can be interpreted so in other words what I'm saying is that the code book and the message can co evolve as the organisms become more and more complex you get a probability distribution of codes that can be the outcome of translation and as the organisms become more and more complex that distribution gets narrower and narrower and very intolerant of any kind of element now you might ask yourself well wait this doesn't make any sense selection pressure acts on the phenotype it doesn't act on the code I want to show you that it acts on the code too okay so here is a thought experiment but for me it was an actual experiment so I'm a physicist so I like to write papers with mathematical equations and so when I write a paper or a grant proposal I write it in a Thing Called Tech a type setting program that enables you to write equations my biological colleagues uh of course use a Microsoft Word which is fine and and so I guess the age of satire is not over yet and so uh so you can imagine the situation where I have sitting with my friends and the institute for genomic biology and I'm saying hey let's write this proposal together and they say sure about so we're going to write it in in word and the heist and my stuff in Tech and of course you know it's it's a complete disaster and uh and uh and what happens is the uh our proposal never actually gets written it never gets submitted and so it never gets funded meanwhile down the corridor another person is collaborating with their co workers they just write it in word no problems and even if their proposal was less good than ours it's still uh it still has a chance of being funded so the code actually uh does matter now what is the basic way that the genetic code evolves in terms of its context so here's our here's a an interesting uh factoid and this this slide is now quite old but uh this is uh this you may not recognize this person this is Bill Gates uh this is the late uh Steve Jobs both of them with examples of their of their of their companies or computers and uh actually uh my computer is a Windows computer but many people like uh like the Apple computers and and the reason that um you know the the reason I use a Windows computer well I mean everybody does right like 96 of all the world's computers run their windows in a very small fashion run uh the the Mac operating system and the reason is that the Windows operating system is much better than oh heck well that's a very inopportune time to have a blue screen of death the Windows operating system is to put it mildly uh rubbish it has all sorts of things like this but the reason why it is so popular is not because it is the best computer system it's because any program that you want to run you can find it on Windows but you may not be able to find it on the Macos that may not be so true today but it was certainly true uh suddenly 10 10 years ago and so what you learn from this is that the community with access to the broadest range of Innovations hasn't evolutionary Advantage anything that you want to do you can find a gadget in that operating system that does it and so what's important for platforms for operating systems for processes that are fundamental to cells like the like translation is that is that you have the broadest reach so what we did in our in our mathematical model which I'm not going to go into in detail was we we considered a simulation a digital life simulation just like the computer virus once that I showed you at the beginning of the call at the beginning of the uh of the of the talk the ones uh run by Niels Barry Charlie at The Institute for advanced study so we have an asexual population of evolving reproducing digital organisms like computer viruses they're phenotype is a function of their proteins and the proteins are obtained by translating the genome with a code but with uh with errors the individual reproduction rate is a function of fitness and the messages change are faster than codes and so forth and so everything that's in this system allows codes to evolve due to selection of the phenotype through the mechanism that I was showing you so now what we're doing is simulating a whole population of different organisms which have different codes another question is which code is the one that wins all right so let's imagine that we've done this experiment so I started with a bunch of organisms all of which have slightly different genetic codes and they all co evolve and they're trying to deal with the environment that they are they're in and we watch how they evolve in time now we did two experiments here I'm going to show you this graph and I'm going to show another one similar to it in the next slide this on the vertical axis is the quality of the code it's how good the genetic code is of those organisms minimizing ever and this is time over here and here's what happens when you do this with regular vertical darwinian Evolution that you're used to and you can see that what happens is that is as I as I evolve the system the uh the um the codes get better smaller is better and then eventually it stops and it just stays constant in time and maybe if we waited like a hundred times longer maybe there'd be some other change down here or something like this and you run it again and for this one you get something like this and you run it again you get something like this and if you ask I've got a whole distribution codes here um what would I have got at random when you can work that out and it would be something like this and so what I've learned is that without uh in this experiment with vertical Evolution only I evolve organisms that have codes that are indistinguishable from random codes and they're not unique and they're certainly not optimal but if I switch on horizontal Gene transfer then what happens is the codes follow this blue trajectory here as you can see end up uh with uh with a very optimal code and one which is very far from what you would get at random and so what you've learned from this is that the process of horizontal Gene to transfer as an evolutionary process leads to optimality of the of the genetic code now if we look at uh at uh how many codes we have in our system and that's shown shown here and again the same thing is true that if you just use a vertical Evolution uh you have you don't get much uh selection of the of the genetic codes as we saw on the previous slide and but if you switch on horizontal Gene transfer you get a universal genetic code and so what we've learned from this is that the the the phase diagram of Life must have looked something like this so we're somewhere up here where in that blob over here early on the evolution was a network process shown schematically over here rapid Evolution and then over here we have the vertical Evolution which we saw was incredibly slow and that's the process that we are in today and the summary over here was a transition that uh that Carl was like to call the darwinian transition I claimed of a phase transition uh between a collective Network phase of life and a transition to a life where organismal identity and individuality becomes more important all right so so I I I'm going to skip my section on homework of housing so I'm just going to skip through that and uh and I wanted to tell you about some of the things that are Universal in biology so anyway the bottom line of this is that uh we made a mathematical model of the evolution of of of of of Kyle autocatalytic self replicators and we could show that uh you ultimately end up with with broken 100 are broken uh chirality not just you get sun right handed or some left handed but 100 effect and that's the thing that we observe in biology and that's the thing that was difficult to explain and and we have made a theory for that okay so um let me just very quickly show you um some examples of universality in Modern Biology even today there are things that are Universal not just the evolutionary processes of say the genetic code which may have happened billions of years ago but other things too so one example of this is the universal statistics routine expression so if I have a genetically identical cells they can exhibit different protein copy numbers that's something that we've known for about 20 years that's called stochastic gene expression the whole process of of expressing genes is a random process and so the protein copy numbers are not thermodynamically large and so what happens is you have large fluctuations in protein copy numbers in in cells and here are experimental data are showing you for a variety of different uh or different uh cells here I'm looking to go through the through the details showing you that there's a universal distribution for the protein copy number now which is all these data are collapsing onto one universal curve which can be predicted this is very much like the universality I showed you in the magnetic system at the beginning of the talk um here's another one which is absolutely fantastic and is still not understood and that is universal metabolism so here's the experiment so what you do is you go into the lab and uh you get some paper and some mud and bits of egg and water and stuff like this and you throw in some microbes and then you make a bioreactor and the bioreactor is producing that same methane okay and so you get this thing running and the bioreactor is uh your measuring is producing a fixed rate of methane coming out if you're feeding the bioreactor and the rate of uh methane coming out is a constant so you say well that's great I wonder what's in my bioreactor what's in my chemostat so you go and do a Melody genomic survey and and what you find is that even though the methane that is coming out is constant when you look at the community structure that you see and here I'm showing you examples where these are real data from from different uh from from a reactor what do you find is that you know let's say day 900 you go and draw a pie chart showing you the different uh uh uh operational taxonomic units that are present in your system and you say now until I'm done and then you know your advisor says aha you're not done wait two years and do the experiment again so you've treated your thumb for two years and do the experiment again and then what you find is a completely different uh set of organisms that are in the back in the bioreactor but it's still producing methane at exactly the rate that it was before this experiment was actually done by Anna Fernandez and uh and in 1999 and her advisor basically served this can't be true we can't publish this the the we can't publish these data but they publish it in any case and and this has been replicated many times since so what we've learned then is that the functional properties of a community are insensitive to taxonomic fluctuations here's a here's another example this is from uh Luca and and durbly uh and uh partly uh this is decoupling function and taxonomy in the global ocean microbiome and basically the same the same story that despite the constant metabolic function of the ocean microbiome there were large taxonomic fluctuations and we don't have any idea well why this is happening okay so these are examples of universal things that are going on right now and they need to be understood and they're telling us something about the collective properties of microbial communities now if the NASA astrobiology Institute was still still a thing in existence and I hadn't moved from Illinois to hear and so on one of the things that I would be thinking about doing is exploiting this for example suppose I want to know what are going to be the bio signatures of say life that lives under the uh the ice of ensalidos well it turns out that the metabolic output of microbial communities doesn't depend sensitively on what organisms are there so if I have some knowledge of the geochemistry I can then exploit this this uh this functional redundancy to be able to make predictions about what a metabolic biosignatures I might find okay so let's end with a discussing about whether or not a universality is is uh is or is not useful so here is an example of another uh scaling law and this is a scaling law in ecology here this was uh this scaling law uh has been known since the 1850s in England uh these are data taking taken from bird lovers actually not bird lovers these are plants never mind these are plants people in England like two things or actually three things they like plants they're like birds and they like beer or like stink any pie or they're like football or whatever you want but they like plants and they're like and they like birds and so there's a lot of data going back uh you know 150 years uh um and and here is showing you the number of species as a function of the area of the of the of the habitat and what you can see from these data is that the number of species uh scales like the area to the one quarter power so you might say here's a field count all the bugs in the field count all the plants in the field double the size of the field count how many they're in there then you might say okay remember species are going to double not true it goes like roughly like the area to the one quarter power not not the area itself so this is a very important law because we can use it to make extrapolations for example if we know how much deforestation happened today in the Amazon let's say then we can figure out how many species might have got affected by that so that says these universal laws are useful here's an argument that says they're not useful so here's an experiment that was actually done this is Battle at Colorado Island in Panama and this is a an island which is beloved by ecologists because it has lots of trees and plants and we know every single tree and every plant on that island it's heavily studded okay so you might ask yourself the following question on this island what is the number of species fraction of species with a given number of individuals okay how many species have 100 individuals how many species have a thousand individuals how many species have four individuals in salt okay so you can produce a species abundance curve and and then you and you get data that looks like one of these curves here I don't even remember which one it is so that would be uh that would be a measurement and you could make a theory for that because you could say well we have to look at the soil we have to look at the weather we have to look at the interactions between the trees the canopy and so on and so forth and if we had a detailed model we could probably predict uh this this this curve but there's another way to think about it which is just to say well this is close it's just a random process something has to be the most abundant organism okay so what I've read is that's it what its name is then something else has to be the next most abundant and you can work out a theory that looks like the general statistics but you would expect for abundance just like the central limit theorem in in statistics and so in in a neutral Theory the species are functionally equivalent they're not different they don't occupy different uh geochemical or biological niches metabolic niches so you've got these two completely different theories and one of them gives the black curve one of them gives the green curve they both explain the data equally well so this is uh again not not helpful so the upside of universality is that you can make predictions based on the normal model and that's a good thing like trying to predict the metabolic signature or putative life under the under the ice cap of encels the downside of universality is that statistically similar results can be obtained from microscopic models that are completely different in their assumptions and so if you have something Universal at a high level of description that means you can't understand the actual processes that went on that caused the thing in the first place okay I want to end by asking what do we miss if we don't understand Universal phenomena and I'm going to talk about an example uh that that may not be meaningful to to some of you or many of you even but it doesn't matter I want you to just understand the the point so this is about something in in superconductivity and uh and there's a couple of students here from my class on emerging states of matter so they'll be familiar with these examples so what is superconductivity it's the it's the fact that you can have a current flowing through a material and there is no electrical resistance and no heat that comes out so that's that's the that's the idea of superconductivity it's just superconductor if you have it you can make levitating trains and and transmit power over long distances and solve all the world's problems that was discovered in 1911 1903 1933 it was also discovered that superconductors don't just have a a current that don't last forever and also go round and round Forever by petrol motion they also expel magnetic fields okay don't ask why it doesn't matter 20 years later after that it was discovered that actually nope it's not true they don't expel magnetic fields well some do but some don't some allow magnetic fields to penetrate a superconductor but in a lattice of so called vortices or flux tubes in a way that is you know I'm not going to I'm not going to go into but that that can happen and then finally oops wrong thing then finally uh about 10 years or so after that something called the Judaism effect was discovered the idea that I can have um a current uh flowing um which which will will be uh um oscillating with a frequency that is just determined by quantum mechanics and doesn't depend on the material or anything like that so you can use this to create a universal standard of voltage and and of time okay so this this is a complicated quantum mechanical effect and it took 50 years and and most of the people on on this who discovered these things ends up getting Nobel prizes these were very important things scientifically and technically and the question is why did it take so long to make these discoveries are physicists stupid well maybe but uh but the thing is this it's even worse because in my class I derive all of these things in basically one lecture in a few lines of algebra from some mumbo jumbo that's written down here okay so what was going wrong what was going wrong was that people were focusing on the wrong level of description and I want to explain to you what I mean by that okay so in world of superconductivity you have to make a superconductor so that's a problem in quantum chemistry and Material Science there's a theory that applies to at least the classic superconductors but not the ones that everybody is excited about for the last 30 years the high temperature superconductors so there's a theory of that which is which is very nice and so on and then lastly there's a theory which I which I've given but this name here is basically a theory that looks at the quantum mechanical symmetries of of Superman actors now when we talk about biology we have another set of levels of description so so this level is quantum chemistry this is electrons moving around and this is looking at Symmetry and and wave functions all right here in biology we start off with the lowest level of description with atoms and molecules there's an intermediate level of description where we you know we talked about with translation we look at our DNA we look at how elastic it is and how proteins fold and things like this we look at a liquid liquid intracellular complexes and things like that in cell biology and then finally on the LA on the larger scale I talked about the Dynamics of how systems evolved the Dynamics of evolving systems like the genetic code so those are levels of description these levels of description answer different questions so in superconductivity well quantum chemistry and Material Science says how do you make a stuff what's the specific recipe of putting the atoms together in such a way that you make a particular superconductor this uh this uh this intermediate level of description tells you about what is the basic mechanism by which uh you know electrons form what's called a Cooper pair a composite boson inside a superconductor and then do something called Bose condensation so this is a sort of more detailed uh description that applies to um to many different superconductors and this level of description this symmetry wave function quantum mechanical Theory describes why the phenomenon of superconductivity exists at all how you can get all the phenomena of superconductivity just from one very simple and mathematical description now in the in the world of biology atoms and molecules tells us something about how specific biopolymers interact and fold undergo template directed synthesis and so on and so forth if you want to understand those questions you have to deal with atoms and molecules there's no way around it if you want to understand um the you know the basic functional cellular processes you don't need to have such a detailed description you can just think about uh you know face separation inside cells and and sort of bending rigidity of cell membranes and DNA and so on and so forth and if you want to understand why the phenomenon of Life exists at all well that's surely a question that would be answered if we understood more about the Dynamics of evolving systems different levels of description apply to different levels of universality so if I look in in the quantum chemistry of material science that tells us something about very specific materials like Atrium barium copper oxide or something like this if I want to look at this level of description it tells us something about what are called weak coupling superconductors and finally this level of description uh this symmetry wave function Theory tells us about all superconductors whether they're made in a material science lab or whether they occur in the in the heart of a of a neutron star in biology this level of description applies effort to uh very specific biopolymers you know this chemical structure of RNA or DNA or some particular protein the elasticity theory for DNA and so on and so forth tells you about the physics of subcellular components and the Dynamics of evolving systems would have would be applying to all life and just in the same way that a universal turing machine with a Von Neumann architecture applies to all things that we call computers now why do we need this Universal level this top level description of of of of stuff well if I have a superconductor and I want to understand uh this level of description not only does it tell me that superconductors exist but it also tells me everything that a superconductor can do it tells me the myosin effect the vortex lattice the josen effects it tells me how a superconductor responds to electromagnetic fields so if I don't have this I can't predict how a superconductive responds to an electromagnetic field and that's a big problem by regarding superconductors as collections of atoms we are missing the emergent laws that act at the system scale and govern the large scale response to electromagnetic fields just like uh when we were looking at our bioreactor it produces methane at a constant rate if we just focus on the on the on the uh on the bacteria that are in there we won't be able to understand that we need to understand how metabolism can be emergent in a community this problem we know how to solve it took us 50 years to do it and we had to re jigger the way we think about physics for living systems we know that this level of description would apply to all of life and what happens if we don't have it we can't predict the response of living systems to selective perturbations we can't tell what happens when you play antibiotics or herbicides or insecticides or chemotherapy to somebody with cancer okay and and we know what happens in the real world whenever we do these interventions and treat living systems as engineered systems what happens is they fight back they evolve the cancer tumor evolves and you and you and you and the chemotherapy stops being effective Roundup stops being effective against weeds antibiotics stop being effective against bacterial infections and so on and so forth by regarding biology as complicated physical systems we are missing the emergent laws that act on the system scale and govern the large scale response to control perturbations and we do not know how to solve that problem otherwise if you if you want to read about any of these things that I've been talking about there is a article I wrote uh called life is physics with uh with Carl Rose and another one on the statistical mechanics of early life uh in in Phil Transit um this one was called life is physics for the following reason well I used to go to astrobiology conferences on the first day somebody would get up and show some extremely complicated chemical pathway that they thought might have existed in the RNA world or the sugar world or lipid world or whatever was the was the fad of the time and they would say life is chemistry and I fundamentally disagree chemistry doesn't it doesn't matter it does matter you can't build a superconductor without atoms and molecules but you have to understand the emergent physical laws as well the dynamical processes that go on and so that's why we talk about this as life is physics all right so did we learn new physics when we studied biological biological systems uh yes we do we we realize that they actually do things that physical systems don't are they Universal phenomena in biology yes genetic code gene expression distribution of species metabolism and so on do they reveal things that are important well yes they tell us about the phase diagram of Life they tell us about cell structure and principles of how things evolve and what do we miss by not understanding Universal phenomena we've we don't understand why life exists at all and we don't understand how to how biological systems respond to control perturbations so so here is uh here's the the history of life we know that some around here was a homocybal transition in the genetic code the darwinian transition and finally 3.8 billion years ago last Universal common ancestor all of this happens super fast because it was dominated by Network effects and while and what I didn't tell you about this in detail or the catalysis leads to 100 homicorality horizontal Gene transfer networks Drive the evolution of the unique optimal genetic code and horizontal Gene transfer eventually becomes ineffective compared to Vertical selection and you get this transition to the vertical phase of life that we are in today I want to end with a quote uh since I'm a physicist I studied biology I'm not because I love biology I have a sort of love hate relationship with Biology but but because it teaches me things that are that expands the scope of physics so ask not what physics can do for biology build you a better microscope build your build a computer simulation understand the uh the structure of some protein asking instead what biology can do for physics it can teach us wonderful things thank you very much [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you so I'm very recently coming to appreciate this the importance of this horizontal Gene transfer but mechanistically I don't understand how like why this trade off is tied to optimizing the genetic code what you don't understand why what mechanistically I don't understand why it's massive Advantage is tied to having a sub optimal genetic code the the horizontal so the question is uh why why why is if I understand why why is horizontal Gene transfer um important in in evolving the genetic code is that what you're asking yeah yeah yeah so so so the fundamental reason is this well I showed you in the in the simulations um was that if you if you just have vertical Evolution which I explained to you what it is um you kind of get trapped in local Minima okay so horizontal Gene transfer is a very non local shuffling of genes that wouldn't otherwise happen and so it's a much faster way of exploring the space of possibilities and so what happened in early life is organisms were very porous there's a lot of endosymbiosis so you know today we we only you know you and I are not horizontally transferring genes the bacteria in our guts are but in early life organisms would sort of Pulp go through each other and Collide and and subsume each other and so on and so there was a very natural built in mechanism for genes to be horizontally transferred and so when we when we model that in our in our simulations what we see is that is enormously effective in accelerating the evolution rate so so bottom line is horizontal Gene transfer is just one way to accelerate evolution and if you accelerate Evolution you don't get stuck in local Minima if you don't get stuck in local minimum as it were you'd then find the true best code or the best whatever it is that you're optimizing and and that's why that's why it works so did I answer your question what was the bit what was the bit that I hadn't explained that made the penny drop I I saw empirically that it was true but the mechanism oh okay so I'll explain that yeah go ahead thank you okay yeah hey there hi uh I'm Maddie from MIT um great talk I was kind of interested based on your like um idea of evolution of this like Pro Genoa like horizontal Gene transfer dominated system evolving to this darwinian phase where do you think kind of the universality of like essential Dogma kind of starts to evolve when we think of like the genetic code of like codons to proteins and DNA like is that something that might have existed with like this pre state or would this be something we only see with like the rise of like I don't think the central dogma even exists today okay we we know we know that that's we know that that's not true we know that there are there are ways that um that that there can be you know post translational modifications you have a virtual transcription and so on and so forth so so organisms uh even today can rewrite their their genome and so um you know when when did the you know of course we we you know we the first people didn't you know didn't know about that Crick called it the central dogma as a joke um but today we know that you know viruses are doing this or all the time so we have lots of endogenous retro bio DNA in our own genomes so so I'm not so convinced that um that the um the central dogma world as it were ever existed or at least even exists uh even exists exists now but the extent to which you know genome editing self genome editing um evolved in time that's not something that I've looked at but you certainly couldn't you could you could imagine it uh suddenly being accelerated during the progenya for example but it's going on today so so um so um did I answer your question or did I just dismiss the premise of the question and so it swept it under the rug that way no it's very fascinating fascinating answer I would say biologists would have a lot to discussion I would say biologists have a lot to discuss with you about um the idea at the central dogma but I think that is a fascinating way to think about it yeah no no I mean I mean I mean you know it may be it may be broadly true but there's certainly lots of exceptions to it and and so uh and that's why I say it's not like it really has to happen it's it's just you know the balance of you know okay mostly these things work but the fact um they're not forbidden by any symmetry or any law laws of physics or anything like this so so how you know fundamentally I I think the the main principle of trying to underlie genome uh genome stability is essentially reproducibility in other words you know if everything is fluctuating too much then you're making too many possibilities and and then you're getting um generalists as well but not new Specialists and so it's really tied up with you know whether the organisms are optimized in a particular environment and for the for you know for their niches in in the ecosystem so I think these these things are balanced like that thank you sure so I'm very excited to see you here because I'm also offices by training and I have two questions for you so first of all can there be nuclear signatures for life and second question is we just can observe five percent of our universe the rest of the universe is dark energy dark matter can there be dark matter life um okay I so the question is are there nuclear signatures of life when you say nuclear what do you mean by that at the nuclear level like we talk about biosignatures of Life can there be signatures at the nuclear level do I don't understand what you mean sorry like uh can there be Nuclear Physics going on which can lead to life oh I I see I see um I don't know about nuclear it's certainly at Atomic I mean there's um I don't really know I don't know the answer to your question but but I'll give you an example there's um there is a particular excitation um in carbon the the oil excitation and and it's probably the the first or maybe only successful application of the anthropic principle uh where he guessed that there had to be such an excitation for some process to occur that was essential for life and indeed it was later discovered to be true so I don't really know the answer to your question it's not impossible because this whole example is is a sort of very strange one it's obviously something that if you take a sort of perspective that you should be looking at large scales of systems you would never think that there would be this kind of thing happening but we also know in physics that there was a scale interference and that small negligible effects can have large consequences I have a whole other talk about about that in trying to understand um the the the tree like evolution of Life which I'm not going to talk about um so so I don't I don't really know um there was a second question a second question was we can only observe five percent of our universe because the rest of the universe is not right so can there be dark matter can there be dark matter and can you have can you have life yeah yeah why not is very very enthusiastically ready to get the back so I I think that that life is you know is essentially an inexorable consequence of the laws of physics I don't think it's Unique or an accident so yes that's why I asked that but I have no scientific reason for for answering your question in the affirmative yes please go ahead yes hello Professor like I just cannot express like how excited I am after your talk so thank you thank you so much actually I have the similar notion like uh I the like uh like whatever you have presented here like I'm I'm literally feeling we share the similar Vibe actually I'm the second year PhD student in astronomy and I have a degree in physics and so like I'm sorry I'm a little nervous but I have I have a lot to talk so uh so uh yeah I I want to ask like uh What uh since uh yeah like I also like the earth centric like investigation of life it it it really doesn't convince me to for like to to see the life outside the universe and so like I'm really interested to study the like uh physical Evolution like how how we can study the life like outside the universe like and and it is true that uh we should have a generic uh like generic definition how should life look like so that's why I'm very much interested in the thermodynamic evolution of life so I just want to know like what are your thoughts about like what do you what do you think about like because there are many uh researchers who are doing uh great work on that the on the thermodynamic evolution of life so I just want to know your thoughts on that and I'm like I'm super excited to work on on this field and uh yeah like even I'm in second year and I like I have already decided I want my second PhD in biophysics and I want to study the thermodynamic evolution of Life So yeah thank you well thank you thank you very much for your kind words and um now I don't I don't quite understand what is the question that you're asking me though the microphone is next year yeah so uh there is uh the the the Third Law of like uh thermodynamics yes yeah the thermo uh yeah the entropy so it it says like um every natural uh laws in the world they have a particular direction and it find this is if that's that's if if we think about that that's that's itself is a is a very great like itself is a very great it tells like every natural you know process in the world they have a specific Direction and what I feel like yeah what I what I feel like that's that's my hypothesis like that life is not the you know the the most like the the most probable state of state of the of the nature nature doesn't want right that's what I think and I want to study this uh with uh like thermodynamic evolution of life that's why uh yeah I want to study that so I wanted to know your uh okay so I think I think I I think I'm sorry I was so long I think I can paraphrase your your question so it tell me if this is a reasonable paraphrasing of your question why why the why does life inexorably become more and more complex I I and I think that is a very important foundational question because you might say okay let's suppose you believed in the RNA World which which I actually as I happened I I don't believe in it but but let's suppose you did then you might say well okay so I get these uh these uh these all the catalytic uh uh replicators I have RNA doing all the functions of of Life uh why isn't the world just you know knee deep in uh self replicating RNA molecules you know why do we have arts and elephants and and blue whales and things like this and so so I think the the you know the the fundamental question is why do you have this uh Evolution to greater and greater complexity and I think that's a um that's a question that we don't have a good answer for now I'll tell you what happens when we try to model living systems uh when we find a model living systems say in a computer you make an artificial ecosystem lots of things interacting with each other and you run it and what happens is it does evolve in complexity just a little bit and then it just stops evolving it just stay it stays constantly and it really the simulation does not involve more and more arbitrarily complex Life As Time proceeds so we try to figure out uh what is the fundamental mechanisms genetic mechanisms that could enable this increase to give you as you put it this directionality of life and and what we discovered was this and it relates to things I emphasize in the talk mostly when we think about Evolution you know you read the newspapers you think about uh mutations and point mutations and things like this I don't think those things are very important at all for evolution on the large scale what we discovered in computer simulations was that there's two things that cause life to inexorably get more and more complex and that is first of all you have horizontal Gene transfer so you have mechanisms that enable essentially an evolving system to really find its its local maximum or local minimum Optimum and the other is Gene duplication Gene duplication is very powerful because you make a copy of a gene and then one copy goes off and Carries On doing what it was supposed to be doing the other one can evolve without deleterious effect on the organism and when you look in in The evolutionary history of of life and you look at uh genomes you see throughout this pervasive influence of horizontal Gene transversely in microbial organisms and um and and and Gene duplication and you see Gene deportation in all branches of life um so so I think what you have to try to understand is the the interplay between these different processes at the genetic level then have consequences for the large scale complexity of organisms so we we built um well I think is the first um computer model of an evolving ecosystem which has continual growth of complexity due to those particular genetic operators and it's not a very realistic model and the model and the method of the the way we measured complexity was completely unrealistic and we measured it by the length of the genome as opposed to something like common golf complexity or some other algorithmic complexity measure but um but it it does show you that certain genetic processes can give rise when they interact with the environment and that was important in our in our calculation I can give rise to this direction of life this ever increasing growth of complexity so that's the best I can do in answering your question is that helpful okay unfortunately we've run out of time for questions so hopefully you can find Nigel at the dinner but let's thank our speaker one more time okay so I'm sure everyone's pretty hungry and tired at this point but if we could just get about another 10 minutes or so just to finish up setting uh Surfside but in the meantime it'd be incredibly helpful if people could help move clear the tables because uh we have the event company that needs to get rid of the Linens and such [Music] um but uh there's also there's some garbage cans outside the Forum so that'd be that'd be helpful thank you [Music] [Music] thank you [Music]
