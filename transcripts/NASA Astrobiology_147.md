[Music] good morning everybody my name is Hector I'm going to be talking about the climates of gl513b this is a work I've been doing with Rory Barnes from University of Washington and Russell Dietrich and Maria damaso to give you an outline I'm gonna first give you an introduction and convince you why we study gl5 for Team B uh I'm gonna show you what are the factors that we consider that affect habitability then I'll show you the methods that we use and then the results follow my conclusion and the Future Works that are deemed important to continue doing so why study this planet in 2022 uh Maria damaso and his collaborators they discover gl514b and what's particular about it it's that it has a high eccentricity eccentricity it's how circular the orbit is and when it's a higher centricity that means that the circuit the orbit is kind of like a noble shape and usually when we study exoplanets we look for planets that are within the habitable zone and this planet because it's very oval shape it kind of Falls in and out of the Habit also so that makes it a particular object to study it also as you can see from the properties it also orbits a Android star which is one of which is the most abundant star in our galaxy and universe and with that in mind uh when we look at the uh the multiple orbits that could happen in this planet uh these are just simulations of what are 0.45 eccentricity orb would look like uh we see that they all go in in and out of this green shaded region which is the habitable zone that we consider the habitable is one of the of the star and the dash line is just uh the best fit orbit we still see it that all of them go through in and out so that's what makes it uh very important to study for habitability since we've never done that before and another reason why we want to study gl519b in this graph I'm showing you here a plot of the eccentricity over the orbital period of the planet uh so how long it takes the planet to go around the its Hoster uh the size of the of the bubbles it shows how much solar installation or how much of radiation from the start is falling into into the planet uh on the top right corner you can see the bubble for what would be like an earth installation so how much uh sunlight we receive the bigger the bubble the more radiation the planet is receiving uh gray gray dots represent we don't have data for for the installation so they don't show any any uh any information about that but in particular when we look at gl514b which is in the middle uh in the middle of these graphs on the top side we see that it's almost unique to it and when we have an orbital period that long around an mdorf it gives us a an idea uh a better view to use Next Generation telescopes such as ground telescopes to to studying them and be able to directly observe them if the planet is too close to the star the planet would be really hard to to see with direct observation uh there's another planet that is really far away which we see it at 250 orbital periods on the right side but it has a lower eccentricity so that way that's why we don't care much to study that one there is a planet with 0.5 uh uh greater than 0.5 x in 360 but it has a shorter orbital period uh than gl514b so it might be really hard to direct observe and we want a planet that we can study in the future and with that in mind the Next Generation telescope such as the uh such as the oh my God uh the extremely large telescope uh it it would be a telescope that should be able to observe uh gl513b this graph is just showing uh what is the maximum angular separation that the planet needs in order to be observed and the planet to start flux ratio uh meaning that the bigger planet to start flux ratio that means we can observe it better and in the Dutch line that represents the boundary to be observed uh to to the planets that could be observed with the elt the extremely large telescope and we expect that gl514me will fall fall within that boundary so we will plan to use elt to observe this planet now I hope I convinced you why study Geo 514b so now uh I want to talk about like what are some factors affecting habitability um so there's many factors when we talk about habitability there's so many things that we can think of uh but I we focus on the ones that we've seen that in other papers that have shown that uh these are the most that affect an impact the habitability and these are the eccentricity that I mentioned is how oval or secular that orbit is the obliquity in which is that tilt of the rotational axis from the plane of of orbit from the star system the Precision angle is the angle of wobbling of that rotation axis and the partial pressure of CO2 which is how much CO2 is built up in the in the atmosphere of the planet and uh the biggest is atomic attack I don't go into much details as to why them but those are the papers that we mostly Focus uh show the uh these are the factors affecting habitability that we want to use for gl514me we use uh so we're called the planet which is an open source code that has 11 11 physical processes that simulate habitability for our planet uh it includes uh binary systems or includes the the radiation for the star the or the services in the orbit these services in the rotation many others but I want the one part that we use from the planet is the one called Poise which is an energy balance model and what it essentially means this graph is a good explanation I did not do this graph uh tremended facilitated and what an idea in in essence what it is it's a balance of all the incoming solar radiation that comes to the planet and how much is that it's either absorbed by the planet or reflected back to the to the space uh Poise does now is a cloud free Cloud free energy balance model so that we don't take into account the the reflected uh sunlight by the by Claus in the atmosphere so that means that we mostly focus on in two parts of the of the energy balance model which is how much is absorbed by the by the by the surface of the planet and on the right side top side you can see that it says are going along with variation how much of that is being radiated by by the atmosphere itself in in longer wavelengths uh in in essence this is the the equation that we use uh to explain it to explain it in a in a easy way I would say that the first term is it represents that absorption of the heat from the surface uh the second term represents how much is being dissipated throughout the atmosphere so atmospheric circulation of the heat uh the third term it just shows the irradiation to space and that should all of that although all of that should balance to the fourth term which is how much of income in solar radiation is falling into the planet um so another thing that Poise does and this is good to know is that it not it's not only an energy balanced model but it also calculates uh the ice sheets or how much ice it's flowing around the planet so is the planet covering full eyes is the planet is just ice free meaning that it's all water or is the planet has a combination of polar caps or other types of ice configurations which are really important for habitability since Earth uh Earth we've seen Earths throughout time has how much the ice has changed in that surface um and another part of the of the V Planet uh that we think of is that outgoing language radiation there are many many ways there are many theories on how do we calculate that how much of that radiation is being dissipated to space um there's uh in the planet there's three of them uh from spigo 2009 and Williams and casting 1997 and Northern cochle in 1979. so spigo and and Northern Coakley those two are going along with radiation they're just as a function of temperature and and Williamson Casino includes a component of partial pressure of CO2 and we can see in this graph how much of that outgoing normal radiation over surface temperature it changes uh um Hing is a functional temperature but with the difference that Williams and casting when we change the partial pressure of CO2 in this case I'm having a partial pressure of simulating Earth's CO2 abundance in the atmosphere and we see that it kind of it gives a more realistic version of how much of that radiation is being dissipated to to space so that means for our purpose of this of this study we use uh Williams and casting 1997 model to simulate how much radiation is being dissipated yeah oh and and to say the uh to say that this William and casting model is only valid from uh negative 83.15 degrees Celsius to 86.85 degrees Celsius meaning that anything that goes if the planet gets too cold or too hot from those boundaries that means that uh our calculations of the outgoing lower radiation are not exactly um accurate so we deem them as if it's too cold that the planet is just completely as Noble and if it's too hot we just demon as a planet completely ice free in terms of the of many other parameters so we're talking about partial pressure CO2 eccentricity obliquity uh and precision angle there's other other parameters that go into an energy balance model and an ice sheet flow diagram so uh here I am just showing you most of the other parameters some uh some of them are arbitrary others are Earth's value uh so you know as every model we have to make assumptions and these are some of the assumptions for example uh the ebm meaning the energy balance model we run it seasonally instead of annually so every season we check uh that we check that energy balance we run it every for four years uh so it's run for four years and we run it every 500 years to calculate it and uh we use the Williams and casein olr model which is outgoing radiation the initial Global temperature we use 14.85 degrees Celsius which represents a pretty pre industrial Earth's temperature we have the deposition rate of snow which is that's from Earth's value uh and then the heat capacity of the land of the water and the albedos they all come also from Earth's value um now the land fraction is analogous is similar to it so uh so we use a 25 Lan and the 75 is just water cover uh it's covered by water to outdo our uh our our simulations we divide it into four simulations uh we first wanted to find values of CO2 uh eccentricity obliquity and precision angle that meet the affiliate protocol I'll explain to you what the filet protocol is uh the second simulation we studied the latitudinal temperature for viruses eccentricities the third one with data parameters sweep of eccentricity and obligories and therefore one with the parameter sweep of CO2 and obliquity uh all of this we run all the simulations for one million years and I did a total of 960 simulations why 960. just because no specific reason um and all of these are just static simulations meaning that the obliquity eccentricity and precision angle of the planet are not evolving over time so that means that for future work just uh spoiler we want to do a dynamic evolution of how we see this eccentricity oblique and precision angle evolve because we see that on Earth we see those values changes for the first one the the filet protocol is just a functionality of ice latitudinal ABM tenacity so it's a protocol an intern comparison project from the Cuisines uh project and and what they want is to do an intern comparison on the different ebms and the first Benchmark case is to achieve Global mean surface of 288 Cummins and that's what we did and we look for what are those values and we found many possibilities but this one I'm showing you here is just the centricity of 0.45 and obliquity of three degrees a Precision angle of 90 degrees and a partial pressure of CO2 or seven seven bars we noticed that 7 bar CO2 is the one that gives the most uh the most stable climates throughout the different bars uh uh pressure pressure of CO2 in here uh I'm just showing you how those the in the first panel is the insulation is being received per latitude on the say on the top right panel is the surface temperature how it varies on the bottom left is a is a ice melon ice mass balance meaning that a clear color ice is being deposited dark color is being lost and on the right we have the outgoing language radiation and what we see is that all of this uh correlates so we have a validation of our code that is working as issue uh so that's why we wanted to do this as our first simulation we're just trying to like uh do kind of like a sanity shake for a code we then did a studio latitudinal temperature for various eccentricities and in here I'm just showing remember that eccentricity is 0.45 but if we look at the error value of of their calculation is plus minus 0.4.15 to 0.14 so if we want to study this to three sigma confidence that means we had to do a range of of 0.03 eccentricity to 0.9 eccentricity so that's what I'm showing here how the different temperatures uh of the planet vary through the one million year calculation on the top one it looks weird yes it is weird and it's because the simulation gets too cold and it goes out of boundary for our simulation of the Williams and casting so that means the plan is just really cool and it doesn't um it doesn't get to to run anymore because it just fell out of the boundaries so for that one uh the planet falls out of boundaries has Noble State the second one is uh we get a global means surface temperature of 26 degrees so it's really hot meaning it's a nice free state and for the last one we have a 0.9 eccentricity but the planet gets too close to the start of the beginning so it's it's so hot that it's just for a lot of boundaries from the other side however because the planet eccentricity is so long that means its Winters are very long so when we're able to lower the eccentricity so that the code could run we see that the global mean temperature is about six degrees so it's not that warm so it's a we get as a noble State even though it's a global temperature of 6 degrees simulation three and I'm Amazon uh this is just a parameter sweep of eccentricities and obliquities how those eccentricity obliquity affects the uh the state of the planet we see ice freeze the dark blue uh snowball will be the gray part purple is a polar ice cup ice caps and the outer boundaries is the region whether it's too hot or too cold and we see that at least polar ice caps are formed this is important because Earth has ice caps so that's what we're trying to achieve if we can see ice caps in the planet uh so this shows up for different accents Regional obliquity that happens and we look at the global mean temperature for those different centricities and obliquities and in we get a 14.85 degree celsius at Atomic Century 0.4 2.5 regardless of the obliquity so we get kind of like a stable Clement irregardless of obligatory for different eccentricities lastly we did a primary sweep of this time instead of changing eccentricity we change the CO2 and we also see that polar ice caps are formed and on the right side we get uh we see that how many of those simulations are either polar cups uh ice free or Noble and we see that a lot of them are ice free and snowball there's very little of polar caps but there is still a glimmer of hope because they still form so that's a good thing that happens and and then I'll leave you to the conclusions so I just want to cut it there but in essence we did find uh temperature uh conditions that can give a temporary climate such as pre industrial Earth 7 bar CO2 would be suggested it's a most stable one for to create those polar ice caps most of the planet states are funny either ice ball or snowball and precision angle does not impact much the eye state of the planet and we don't need direct observations to assess the habitability of gl5 for Timmy and I'll leave you there thank you [Applause] [Music] character so we have time for one quick question uh great talk um so it seems like you're suggesting that uh snowball state is a is a permanent State and I'm curious as to whether or not your simulation show any deviation from that um because you know we know that that's a state that has been influxing our planet so I just I wonder if your simulations can account for coming out of a snowball State yeah so this so at least the simulation what so what is showing is that the uh what I'm showing here on the on this histogram plot is the last state at the at the end of the simulation uh but uh papers have shown that one million year is a good enough time for c for uh simulations uh for climates to stabilize the thing is that because we're doing a static Evolution we don't expect it to change but if we add the dynamic part which is like changing obliquity and eccentricity and precision I go while we're evolving the planet then that could that could change uh and it could be it could have been like a snowball State at one point and then change to something else but for this for the static ones we're not we're not expecting this to change since there's not much fluxes [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
