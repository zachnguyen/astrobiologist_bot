[Music] I'm gonna call back a little bit to a couple of the sites that Emily mentioned before and uh what's exciting for me is that I'm in San Diego for the first time so I finally might be able to go see one of the field sites I'm about to talk about and I had no idea that there were actually palm trees down here around my supposedly extreme field site so that'll be a a funny dichotomy there but um so yeah we're gonna be following the salt uh uh and it's going to be a lot of salt so uh uh hang tight there so the first field site South Bay saltworks which is down the road um is a salt Farm which as water is taken from the bay it is uh brought in and um the the people there are are basically taking the the hay light out and using that to I believe soften the water here and then the magnesium chloride also gets concentrated and and separated and so you get these um these really sodium chloride concentrated uh regions and magnesium concentrated magnesium chloride concentrated regions and then you also have uh regions which are a lot more like seawater and so um that's South Bay salt works that's one of the sites I'll be talking about a lot today and what we're investigating there um with oceans across space and time uh is can bioseignature molecules be detected in these sites um with these super high salinities and uh then how does that input impact our search for life elsewhere and um then how do these vary with things like water activity and ion concentration and then here's another analog site in Western Australia this is Lake Campion which is a very interesting site that we looked at um and uh so these are transient lakes and so uh they um they evaporate during the drier warmer months and then they fill up during the winter months and so you get these salt crusts which build up on the bottom of them and so uh these are really interesting because uh the the evaporation process is happening very actively so we can get a modern look um at what's happening there and so in general analog sites can give us training grounds for robotic exploration on other planets they can help us test our instruments and uh particularly we want to know how salt and acid acidic uh um low PH environments affect our uh our instruments and then it can give us insight into the environmental processes and the biology happening there and so uh now I'm gonna uh shout out uh Luke Fisher's review paper in environmental microbiology where he talks all about the bioseignature preservation uh in Brian's particularly in deep hyper saline anoxic basins which I won't be talking about today but when it comes to brines themselves as opposed to evaporates or salt crystals um we know that DNA and RNA are well preserved while mRNA is not as well preserved and that ATP preservation has been observed by uh to ovala at all in 1987 but not much has been done about that since then and lipid preservation is being studied more and more recently and so that's good but but these aren't nearly as well explored um as genetic uh compounds and so uh one compound that we're looking at ATP adenosine triphosphate it's a short lived molecule and it's used um in astrobiology and in ecology as a marker of microbial activity and so if you have a lot of ATP means that a lot of microbial activity is happening if you don't have any microbial activity then you're probably not going to have much ATP but it's very highly evolved so as a biosignature it might be less agnostic than for example amino acids and so we could look at polypeptides or we could look at individual amino acids and we target biological amino acids in this study as well as osmolite amino acids which are solute compounds that are accumulated by microbes when they're under high stress in hyper saline sites so and that's well understood in the literature that these osmolites exist and so first I'll talk about the methods that we used in in the field um or near the field in the motel room we looked for ATP using a luciferase assay and so say you have a beautiful Crystal from the crust of a lake like this from Western Australia then you take it to your Western Australia motel room and you do a uh you set out your samples we weigh them out we extract them in hot water and then we add our luciferase and luciferin and we have a field portable luminometer in order to do our analyzes and so that's how we uh quantify ATP and moving on to what we do at Georgia Tech when we bring the samples home so uh I was so glad to hear that uh another uh person here was using capillary electrophoresis so I don't need to explain it in its entirety again but um it's a separation method that uh in our lab we pair with laser induced fluorescence and so laser induced fluorescence mean means that we're tagging our amino acids our compounds of Interest with a fluorescent dye so we're targeting specific compounds um and so this is a targeted technique which has very low limits of detection and very high sensitivity and so um we did this at South Bay saltworks on one of the samples that has a water activity of below 0.4 and magnesium concentration of more than four molar and uh this is only a one to ten dilution so using a method that um Marshall Seton and I developed uh we got the concentration of amino acids in this sample down to tens of nanomolar the limits of detection for this method General are in the tense of picomolar and we did this using a commercial instrument um and again it was only a one to ten dilution for this uh hyper saline uh sample so we were delighted that uh the results came out like this and then for an untargeted analysis we can use uh microchip capillary electrophoresis paired with uh high resolution Mass spectrometry so if we take the same sample and we look at it using an untargeted method where we can get the master charge ratio of the compounds that we're interested in then uh combining the zip chip commercial setup with a thermocute exactive orbitrap we this is what the chip looks like it's very cute uh we get a very interesting set of compounds which we didn't necessarily Target and so uh moving back to the LIF analyzes for the results what we first observed was that as we increase in magnesium concentration and decrease in water activity and increase in chaotropicity we get a significant increase in the dissolved free primary amines that we were targeting and so that would be our biological amino acids which you've identified here and as you go up you have higher magnesium sites and we have a lot higher Peaks and we also have a lot higher values for Quantified amino acids and so we attribute this to evapo concentration as the sites which have a lot of water and a lot of salt and then evaporate and leave the salts and the Organics behind the concentration is higher so that's pretty straightforward and simple but it is very useful in the case where we're looking at very low biomass regions so uh next we then put it in micro uh micro microchip cems and we looked for these same compounds and we found a lot of them there and so you can see uh histidine Glycine alanine isoleucine and leucine are resolved there serine Etc et cetera glutamic and aspartic acid um and this was only a one to four dilution of that same sample so we were really delighted by these results as well and in the same separation just um looking at different traces different M over Z's we see a couple polypeptides and we see some adenine and guanidine in there as well and so these are things that we didn't necessarily look for in the celif but now that we're combining it with an untargeted method we can we can get a look at some more compounds that we didn't necessarily expect and then also osmolites which we did expect and did want to look for we found those like ornithine sarcosine and betaine in our samples with very high salt stress being applied to any of the microbes that were alive there um and and so these are are there in significant quantity and in Western Australia uh briefly I'll just show you some preliminary results this is Lake Brown which has a sodium concentration of near five molar and a water activity of 0.89 so not nearly um as low water activity as the South Bay saltwork sample I just showed you um but it has high relative concentrations of a lot of these uh compounds including the osmolite compound baiting and uh some lower concentrations of other compounds including a polypeptide and then conversely at Lake Gunter which has a higher water activity and a lower sodium concentration we see that there really isn't any easy way to detect those organic compounds with the method that we're using right now so just diluting these samples so perhaps this indicates that the uh and of course there's only two data points with Western Australia but you know looking at what we found at South Bay salt Works perhaps these saltier sites are actually places where it might be easier to detect biomolecules because of evapot concentration and we also want to look at the normalized abundance of certain amino acids just to see what sort of patterns we could find and if we have water activity increasing from left to right here um with the Magnesium sites here we see that certain amino acids are upright regulated in this magnesium heavy site and others are down regulated and with that information we decided maybe we could classify our sites based on the amino acid distribution so if you take the distribution in you put in a classifier either logistic regression or random Forest you could get out one of these three different site types and this is a small data set and more of a proof of concept than anything but it's interesting to see that we have a very good area under the curve of you know 1 or 0.83 which uh and and we also can see which compounds are driving that the most and so that's an interesting thing to take note of that might be used in the future if we have much larger data sets and so the last thing I wanted to talk about ATP if you remember so uh on the x axis here's magnesium concentration and then we have three y axes because why not and um uh first of all I want to mention the cell counts by microscopy which is uh from Ben klempe uh showed that the number of active cells in these sites go down as you get to the super high magnesium concentration regions which is also um what Emily showed in her talk and so uh what we then can look at is the ATP concentration which strangely goes up even as the concentration of active cells goes down and the expected activity goes down and so we wondered why is that happening because um as we know the amino acids are concentrating but amino acids don't Decay on really short time scales they're not broken up by hydrolysis or by atpase enzymes but we think is that something must be driving this and if it's not evapo concentration uh well uh we're wondering you know since the ATP hydrolysis rate is uh much quicker than the evapo concentration rate uh why would the ATP accumulate doesn't really make much sense but perhaps it's being preserved so this to ovala at all paper from 1987 that I mentioned way earlier uh they found that ATP was preserved in low water activity sites and so that could be preventing the enzymatic uh and natural hydrolysis of ATP leaving it to uh persist in the solution and additionally it could also be used as an osmolite compound as well and be accumulated by those microorganisms before they end up in a super high magnesium site and not very active themselves so in conclusion we can detect biosignatures at micromolar concentrations in near saturation brines using celaf and microce Ms and amino acid distribution ratios can be well classified based on their brine type and osmolites are present and detectable in some but not all of the South Bay saltworks in Western Australia Brines and we found preservation of ATP at Southbay SolidWorks and so basically my argument is then why don't we follow the salt and see if we can find biosignatures there on other worlds so thanks for listening foreign we have time for two questions Chad thank you for the talk um that was a beautiful separation that you showed uh showed earlier um so I'm I'm curious uh you did a connotation of amino acids using celf method and it looks like you've done some work using cems have you tried uh quantifying the amino acid content in the same sites using microchip cems and seeing what those look like to try and like cross validate both methods and the using the same sample yet or have you not got to that yet nope so we just started doing the micro CMS work over the past month and so we're really happy how it's been doing with qualitative untargeted work but we haven't gone into quantitative because the ion suppression effects might be a bit of a challenge to overcome so that'll probably be a little bit of a longer project what we have done to try to corroborate the amino acid concentrations is look at the expression of um or not the expression rather but the presence of certain proteins in the genetic code of the microbes that are were found to be present here by other uh host collaborators and um we find a moderate correlation between the amino acids we see and the amino acids that they see but since we don't have transcriptomes from all of these sites we don't know exactly what proteins are being made and so I think that's the next step is is to connect those from metabolomics to transcriptomics to genomics just as the talk last night uh was uh was discussing so yeah thank you any last question for Chad um I have a two question actually oh maybe I didn't really catch you what's a pH of the site that you show the Magnesium concentration is more than four molar that's a great question I don't know off the top of my head but I can get back to you in a moment yeah okay um and also how would you determine your atp's accumulated or protected under high selling water or like a low water activity how did I sorry say again how did I how do you know that your ATP is not hydrolysis so yeah I don't know that it's not hydrolyzed necessarily but I am predicting that so the the typical destruction um method of ATP uh either in the cell or in the environment is through hydrolysis either performed by proteins or just happening naturally in the environment with water and so those are the those are the things that must uh from what I'm observing have been stopped if the ATP is going to persist so long for it to be evapo concentrated to those high of levels um the huge Spike there likely wouldn't have been possible if uh of Apple concentration weren't a component and so um you know unless uh the uh the osmolite effect is is uh so much more significant than I had thought um that could be another reason but I still think that uh the the preservation of ATP is yeah is linked to the the lack of a um a rapid breakdown mechanism uh have you ever considered that ATP with um form some nanostructures to make the things happen yeah so whether it stabilizes it in some way the yeah so I've I don't honestly know much about how it would investigate that I've spoken to someone recently about um potentially modeling it uh using molecular Dynamics but uh I haven't you know waded into the um you know the actual uh the structural chemistry of whether of whether that would happen but if you have any ideas I'd love to hear so thanks yeah thanks Chad foreign [Music]
