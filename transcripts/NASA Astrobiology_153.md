[Music] hello everyone I'm Sadat from jet propulsion laboratory and I'm here to talk about the work that I started before joining JPL in India and for those of you in the audience who are currently involved or plan to do work in different parts of the world where astrobiology has huge potential and significance hopefully with some of my experience you'll be able to take things forward so first of all a little bit about myself so I'm originally from India and before joining JPL um I have an engineering background and my current work is actually on Enceladus on Sample collection Technologies but unfortunately today I'm not going to be talking about that this is primarily going to be focused on that but just giving a heads up people can find me after the talk and maybe we can chat um but here here is why we focused on India well first and foremost as a country India has one of the largest student populations as some of you might be aware every year we've got several thousands of students graduating in science and engineering and on a daily basis we get inquiries about how do you study and how do you work in astrobiology so there's a huge supply and demand problem and there's little to no formal education or you know career prospects in the country so that was the first and foremost no brainer reason secondly I would like to really promote the fact that we have an amazing diversity of high value science analogs and these are places where some of you might actually find some of your work to be super relevant so with this in mind these sites are not even on the atlas of astrobiology sites that the community normally works in and lastly our National Space Agency Indian space research organization is finally reaching a point to to involve astrobiology as an important science priority for its future missions it had the Mars Orbiter mission in 2014 currently there are it's under Works to work on a Surface mission that would work on the progress and the success of the lunar mission that will be launching in a month from now and finally there is the gaganyan program which is the human space program which will have astronauts working in low earth orbit so that's with that as the basic motivation of why we decided to do this seven years ago let me talk quickly about the background in terms of what astrobiology was happening before we kind of stepped in so the earliest what we could find is between 97 to 2005 Israel was involved in scientific balloon experiments where they were basically working on collecting and understanding microbes in the stratosphere um cut to 2015 where as a grad student I got an opportunity to go on an astrobiology expedition to New Zealand and along with a few other Indian and Indian origin researchers we decided to bring the program to India and that's what we did as part of the um NASA space shut down India Expedition that was the first time that a dedicated astrobiology expedition was taking place Gathering and bringing together researchers in the country and that's where ball just really started rolling the momentum started building up and let me tell you something that working and socializing with people in uncomfortable dry desert environments is way better than inside an air conditioned customer with experience so some of the things I led from that was the establishment of a standard of Excellence in astrobiology at Amity University Mumbai which was the first dedicated Center that I was a part of leading and also as part of Blue Marble space the organization that I had been affiliated with the astrobiology India group has been active since then working to promote coordination activities between domestic researchers in the country so we've been having National level meetings and discussions and what we want to do from here is move forward towards setting up a national astrobiology program closely in support with the Indian government I don't have enough time but I'll try to do justice to this slide um our efforts at the center focused on three main verticals the microgravity research we built plant based plant growth observation experiments for ISRO we worked on characterizing some of the sites in ladakh which is an early Mars analog and Hardware testing for Rovers and in collaboration with UC Berkeley the Berkeley City Research Center we had four research fellows who were working to use um radio telescope data from gmrt which is a array facility there to set up a city pipeline and our research work has culminated into the university finally agreeing to have a master's program that is dedicated for astrology and science students so hopefully this year onwards we'll have students in India who'll have that opportunity to study there um Blue Marble space has been a great source of information and help and network so those of you are not affiliated I would say strongly recommended do consider it quickly talking about some of the unique aspects of Astral biology in India I've just highlighted some of the main sites here in ladakh up north which is a high altitude code dry desert environment Kutch which is one of the largest salt flats in the world the only accessible Basalt impact Creator in lonar uh the basalt traps and Limestone caves and there are several others and because we don't have a National astrobiology Institute yet there have been institutions that have been mushrooming over the last few decades and I've been uh very successful and fortunate to be part of several senior earth scientists to work towards setting this up and it's only because of these people who you're seeing on the screen over here that we're able to do this and we've been working through the pandemic to make this happen they've been a working group uh several working groups that have been put in place uh we've been closely following uh work done in Europe and at uh in the United States through the NASA Astra Biology Institute to help form these working groups and these are some names in some areas where you know people have been working and too much information bad slide I know but I just wanted to tell you that there are these sites and we have been trying to map out the science objectives the different Technologies what worlds are they analog to and what kind of missions would they be able to support into the future um some other ways in which we have been contributing we published our first advocacy paper and new space Journal uh talking about the importance of astrobiology for India and internally we have been contributing to the science roadmap for uh ISRO as well now three main wins for us one is the fact that we've got several students who have gone through our uh system and these are the people who in the future will be taking light forward this year ISRO published its space policy document and we were very happy to see that they have acknowledged the importance of estrobiology because they've mentioned that they will be looking into extraterrestrial habitability so for us as a country this is a huge win that finally ISRO has acknowledged us and the fact that there is now comprehensive I would say not enough but still uh comprehensive diversification of funding for scientists in the country to do this but definitely more work needs to be done and more funding needs to be put together so my last slide um to summarize some of these things if you are in your region or country interested in setting things up the first and foremost step is to bring early and mid career people together and encourage conversations to take place at a domestic level at the same time leveraging International work and like I said field workshops are amazing for team building finding an important University or a host institution is critical because if you're doing events logistically speaking it's important to find an organization that will support you and beware of non scientific and exploitative groups in the in the in the region finally convene workshops identify research interests try to tailor them together into overarching themes and help the group formalize themselves in the form of a virtual Network a non profit or a society and finally encourage the group members to work closely with their government for their astrology goals so that's my time and you hope you can find me and those of you are interested can talk more on this thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]
