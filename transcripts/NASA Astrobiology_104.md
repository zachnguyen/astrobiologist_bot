there is a really cool thing you can do right now it's called Message in a Bottle you can go to [Music] europa.eu and Europa and be part of this Mission helping us learn even more I even have my own uh little message in a bottle with my name on it that's going to Europa I do this for every Mission because NASA coms is awesome and lets us through this and also if you go to that site you can also read the poem in Praise of mystery a poem for Europa written by the poet laor Adon and learn more about Europa Clipper along the way too so definitely do that add your name as a message in a bottle to be sent to Europa which might be one of the possible places where we could find life in our solar system and until next time remember stay curious
