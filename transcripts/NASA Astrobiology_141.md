[Music] hi everyone um I'm just going to make a quick note before we start that it's great to be an astrobiology conference because the background slides are going to go much more smoothly I presented the sort of microscopy conference a few months back and it was a different experience so thank you all for being here um and being you um so um I'm going to talk uh this is going to be a little bit of a pivot from some of the previous talks but I'm going to talk um about some of the methods that I've been working on to actually detect life on a mission a life detection mission to Europa or Enceladus I'm also going to make a note so I'm going to be talking about uh a life life detection missions to Europa and Enceladus as a target for this but um once you have a space capable microscope this could potentially be applied to like all sorts of destinations so there's lots of fun possibilities here the aforementioned background slides so um when we're picking destinations to look for life um there's uh we like to look for places that have habitable conditions things that have liquid water abundant energy sources and conditions that are suitable for uh Life as we know it or as we might predict it may exist and um I'm just gonna let Enceladus and Europa sit up there because we've already heard a lot of justifications as to why those are promising targets to find those conditions and why we might have had um an uh origin of life or uh living organisms currently there um but when we're searching for life we also have to think about how we're actually going to look for it and so um we can kind of break down life into some of the key components that make it up things like uh catalysts that help it uh metabolize things like information storage polymers so DNA or RNA and earth based life and that might look very different for extraterrestrial life um and also compartments life on on Earth Life as we know it loves to put things inside of membranes and then sometimes they put those membranes inside other membranes and have them connect to other even more membranes but those that packaging really helps it do some interesting chemistry um and so when we're then thinking about this in the context of a mission um we can start to think about how we might actually observe that and what analytical approaches we need to take to try and get at that um and so I put the like giant table up here um because uh these are all things that people are working on um for Life detection instrumentation but we're going to be focusing for this talk on containers um and so um the reason for that is um that again as mentioned life loves to package things into compartments and those compartments can be directly observable by using a microscope to look for morphology and also for the collocalization of certain key chemical biomarkers um so in um our team we're working on um a microscopy system that we call a luminescence imager for exploration or life um and there is uh two key hardware components of this system one is the fluidic subsystem and this is to deal with um the actual sample processing and preparation for Imaging something so um my background full disclosure is actually not an astrobiology it's in fluorescence microscopy and um you know I spent like five or six years in grad school just moving fluids around in tubes and like preparing things on slides before they actually get to the microscope I've been told it would be expensive to send me to Enceladus so uh this is this is my replacement um and then the other end is the actual microscope itself so the optic system which is going to have all of the things that you need to actually take your pretty pictures um so I'm gonna break down what goes into these systems a little bit so the fluidic subsystem that uh like uh silver plate on top um is the rotary filter stage and so the um the stage can do seven individual experiments um and so that accounts for originally this was designed with the Europa Lander Mission Concept in mind where there would be three separate samples each with a replicate and then a procedural blank and then each of those individually has um three uh filters of different sizes um and so uh that basically will let you sort out particles so the filters are 10 microns 1.2 microns and uh 0.2 microns in size and that's just so you don't end up with larger particles obscuring any of the smaller particles that you're trying to image in your sample um and that way you're not missing any of the like good stuff that might be there um there you use all it's also attached to the fluidix manifold which is the part that actually moves all of the liquids and fluids around and it also has a lot of sensors for pressure pH conductivity and also crucially some storage for the fluorescent stains that I'm going to be talking about a little bit later in the talk um and then these were the filters that I mentioned earlier and so uh this is again for sample size sorting but they're also made of a silicon nitrate substrate that has a low fluorescence background um and this whole system has passed Environmental Testing so um one thing about microscopes and also uh you know fluid fluidix has a fair bit of space flight Heritage but in general Hardware uh can break and I'm sure everyone who's worked in a lab is dealt with a lot of like issues before so you want to make sure these things are robust and you can actually get it to where you want to launch it to um the optic subsystem is a nice small compact box and so um this is a 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter by 13 centimeter Cube I have uh an image on my phone that I didn't upload to the presentation because the image quality is not that good but for context that's about as tall as a banana which is very small for like a benchtop fluorescence microscope um there is like fancier microscopes can sometimes be like the size of of a person if you're trying to do crazy like two Photon lifetime Imaging or something but even an Epi fluorescent scope would probably occupy like this Podium normally and there'd be a lot of like miscellaneous kind of assorted parts so it's a really nice little system and so that contains all of the excitation LEDs emission filters all the Optics um and so uh this table is just kind of going through what the different uh bits of Hardware that we have are and um to kind of like give the the the high level Summary of why this is relevant um basically we have three LEDs that are common excitation wavelengths for different fluorescent stains that can also excite different types of autofluorescence and then um one thing that's actually relatively unique to this microscope certainly no microscopes I've worked with previously have had this is the 275 nanometer LED so that's actually fairly far in the ultraviolet range um and that's really good at exciting protein fluorescence so uh tryptophan phenylalanine the various aromatic amino acid side chains actually fluoresce quite brightly in the ultraviolet and so that can help image native fluorescent of samples and also excite the fluorescence of many different kinds of minerals um the objective is also set up to help uh well it's robust a space flight but also the part that I think is super fun is that it most objectives actually can't collect light in that ultraviolet range um so it is a custom objective that's built for those sorts of experiments um it has a Piezo stage that lets us do automated Z stacking and this is also been subjected to environmental and shock and vibrational testing and also radiation testing um to the specifications of the Europa Lander mission so um we're now on our ongoing work is actually characterizing this microscope by Imaging different types of samples to see what the the the limits are of what we can detect so um this sample is just kind of showing uh some of the bright some bright field images from a sample that was collected from Lake undersea in Antarctica and so um I'm showing here the 10 Micron and 1.2 Micron filters to kind of highlight that um we can image the the objects at um of very different sizes and you can see the physical uh size of the little uh holes there um and so if we were to just put this all onto one filter that microbial matte looking thing on the the your left um would probably obscure some of the smaller objects that we're seeing in the other filter sizes um and so um as I mentioned earlier we can also excite native fluorescence and so we can correlate this as well with the bright field images so we can take an image of an object say oh hey that looks interesting I wonder what that is look at the you know native fluorescence in different ranges and get a sense of okay wait we've got a bunch of like Organics that are fluorescing in the UV range that are all localized on this object that's pretty exciting and then we can also then stain the sample with fluorescent stains to look for more specific chemical signatures and so in this case I'm showing the same sample after it's been treated with a stain for primary amines and another one that stains lipids and so we can look for both the presence of those molecules but also their co localization in space and this is a really like unique and Powerful kind of data that you can get from the microscope is not just like what compounds are there but seeing that they're associating with each other kind of gives you a good piece of evidence that you might be seeing some disequilibrium and some living structures um microscopy data is also large um maybe not as large as some of the types of data that we've talked about in this conference so far but certainly large enough that if you were trying to send all of this data back from Europa or Enceladus it would be more complicated to handle and so one of the things that we're able to do on this microscope is actually take a z stack of of images and compress it down to a single image that's much less in data volume and so the image I'm showing right now is um an image set of images that were automatically collected at different focal planes in the sample um and then after it's run through the compression routine you end up with a single in Focus image and you're now suddenly gone from megabytes of data to kilobytes of data um and then um you can even go further with that and you'll notice that this sample has uh bright objects against a dark background we don't actually care what the like Photon shot noise is on the background for our purposes that might as well just all be zero and so the final compression step is actually taking that and setting it to zero and so we're just recording um the actual bright objects that are detected in the image and so that all reduces the data size quite substantially um without really getting rid of any of the information that we actually want to take out of that sample um so how would this work in in a mission I just talked about a lot of different parts and now I'm going to bring it all back together into how this system could be implemented um so and I have the little Europa Lander picture there um but basically uh we pretend that the microscope is somewhere in that Lander um you would take your sample process it pump it through the fluidic system you can image it on the microscope you're going to end up with megabytes of data that you can then compress back down to your kilobytes of data send it back to your ground based Observer that will then be able to say oh okay cool we got a microbial mat on Europa time to hit the Press um and so uh yeah just briefly acknowledgments there's been a lot of funding that's gone into this um and um I'll be happy to take any questions great talk uh this is Chad pazoriski at Georgia Tech so um I'm really happy that you touched on uh compression first of all uh of the data because that's incredibly important and um I was also really thrilled that you talked about the um sample prep and fluidics because I think that's something that a lot of people don't consider for these NCG missions uh my question has to do with um comparing uh microscopy and staining with uh perhaps something like Raman or IR where you could get information about at least functional groups of the Organics present and co locate things that I imagine similar resolution spatially but you wouldn't need to include those processing steps so would you advocate for a system that's I guess maybe not redundant but but has both of those features or do you think one is better than the other yes this is actually a super interesting discussion and we can definitely also talk more about it at lunch but the the high level thing that I'm going to say is that um you you get you're going to have different pros and cons and get different types of data those techniques so if you're doing let's if you want to get spatially correlated Ramen data when you're building a microscope and you're trying to image something unless you're using a super resolution technique you're limited by diffraction in terms of like the the resolution that you can get and that is proportional to the wavelength that you're using so when you start to get into like the IR you know range and things like that um your spatial resolution starts to be more limited than it is in the optical range the flip side is you're right you can get precise chemical information out without um you know adding labels and so I think that definitely those are uh like in in in in the perfect mission architecture I think you do both um but you know and um unfortunate you know it's it's it's unfortunate that we can't send all the instruments that we want out there but like in my ideal world I think those that would be a powerful like correlative technique there um to kind of get a a strong sense of what you're seeing in your sample um but yeah great question thanks foreign again thanks for an awesome talk this is really exciting so I was wondering what sample prep looks like um in the Rover or whatever and um what the capabilities are for that so could you actually do like incubation experiments and then look at it with microscopy or is it coming straight from the environment going straight to the microscope yeah so um it's the the the design that we had in mind for for sample prep here and when I said I say we it's not um us this was kind of the built around the Europa Lander specifications but essentially you'd have a sample cup that would collect an ice sample and melt it down and so that was kind of the um the initial like thoughts behind um the design here but the fluidics processing system can basically handle anything that's in a liquid state but the assumption would be that it's a relatively unprocessed field sample um relatively unprocessed because obviously if it's like ice or something and you're melting it down you are still doing something to that sample um thanks okay we have time for one more question hi thank you for the great talk um my question is uh maybe I missed that you mentioned how are you going to differentiate uh any other particles um from the living materials like can you specifically stain genetic material or anything biological yeah so that's actually that's a great question and um so the the the the goal here is to kind of pick up as many different breadcrumbs as you as as we can to try and uh differentiate and so you mentioned stains for genetic material one of the stains that we would be launching with this is a stain for nucleic acids um now obviously that would be really awesome if we found DNA on Europa or Enceladus but um there's it's kind of an open question whether we would um and um so the idea behind looking for the something like the co localization of amines and lipids is that that gives you a more like agnostic idea of like hey that might be living material because you've got these you know chemical signatures that are co locating um the other thing is um so one of our um collaborators actually the person who helped build the microscope um is has some ongoing work characterizing the fluorescence of uh diff of a wide library of minerals to get a sense of like what they would potentially look like um on the the microscope so we can hopefully differentiate between that and things that might be a little bit more biological but spectroscopically and then also you know morphologically um yeah a great question amazing thank you for the talk [Applause] [Music]
