[Music] the next lecture covers the essentials for biological life what is actually required for life we cover this material with a huge caveat the caveat is that we don't know the general answers of the question all we have is one example of biology what happened on this planet starting about 4 billion years ago we have a theory of biology for this planet involving the microscopic mechanism of dna as an information carrier and the macroscopic mechanism as natural selection for showing the evolution of species but we don't know if these mechanisms in these theories of biology are universal so even though the ingredients appear to be universal we have to be cautious in talking about the mechanisms of biology because we only have one example to study with that understood we can talk about what biologists think is essential for life on the earth and by presumption elsewhere the two ingredients that seem to be critical are water and carbon so terrestrial life as our only example we know that it does need these two ingredients almost every organism on earth uses water in multiple ways life on earth began in water the earth is a watery planet even though the water of the earth's oceans and inside the rocks is a very small fraction of the mass of the planet it's a significant ingredient of the biosphere the place where life exists and so we expect other forms of life and other places where life might exist in the universe to need water as well and we think life does need carbon carbon is by far the most versatile element for making long chains of molecules and essentially for building complexity and since biology is complex and intelligence and sophisticated higher life forms are extremely complex we need a base ingredient that sustains and encourages complexity let's look again at what the human body is contained and this is typical of all biological creatures of course 96 of the human body is made of just four elements hydrogen oxygen carbon and nitrogen biologists would say there are another dozen or maybe 15 trace elements that are important for our chemistry including magnesium calcium even selenium these trace elements we have no idea because we can't do more than a thought experiment as to whether biology could exist without those trace elements but the four key ones we're confident life is based on and probably needs hydrogen is the simplest element with one electron to bond to other elements it can of course form a molecule but it can also form complex change with that one free electron oxygen has six free electrons but generally only bonds with two other atoms oxygen is also highly reactive nitrogen has an odd number of available electrons and that limits its potential for bonding with other elements carbon has four valence electrons which results in enormous number of possible combinations essentially carbon is promiscuous chemically and can bond easily and readily especially with carbon and so hydrocarbons which we know of the basis of organic chemistry can form an essentially infinite number of ways a carbon molecule bonded with hydrogen atom makes what is called an organic molecule that's the definition and organic molecules are the basis of biological life because they're based on this versatile bonding property of the carbon atom we can see some simple examples for instance methane where the carbon bonds with four hydrogen atoms we can see carbonic acid which is a fundamental ingredient in human and animal blood and then we can see more complex chemicals like hormones and neurotransmitters which are also organic molecules with hydrogen and carbon skeletons long chains loops side chains and so on the geometric and chemical complexity of hydrogen and carbon compounds is as i said almost infinite and each particular compound has its own chemical properties and role in biology organic molecules are not uniquely confined to the earth when we're talking about the ingredients of life being widespread in the universe we should remember that molecules also exist in space i talked about how atoms or elements are produced inside stars but in the cooler regions of space molecules can exist notice that inside stars you only can have elements and in fact all the atoms are ionized which is to say have their electrons stripped off by the very high temperature inside stars but the cooler regions of space between stars such as molecular clouds or the interstellar medium have temperatures of tens of kelvin or maybe up to 100 kelvin and at these low temperatures when atoms bounce into each other or react on the surface of a dust grain which is a very important mechanism you can form complexity and molecules as we speak there are something like 130 different molecules that have been measured in interstellar space and there are more found almost every year these range in number up to the number of the simplest amino acids about a dozen atoms i think the largest is about 19 atoms so these are by no means trivial molecules and with 130 of them some of them are biologically potentially very important such as the amino acid but biology cannot form we think in deep space however it is important to know that the biological ingredients at the level of molecules do exist in deep space and do exist in the molecular clouds where stars will form and planets will form some of our best indications of this have also come to the earth the molecules that i previously talked about discovered in space are typically found with radio telescopes because while atomic transitions in elements tend to make spectral features in the optical or ultraviolet region the rotational and vibrational states of molecules have much lower energy and so those spectral features are seen at long wavelengths typically the far infrared millimeter or even radio region so the discovery of molecules in space deep space at low temperatures has been found by radio telescopes in the last 50 years and as we combine radio telescopes in different interferometers radio methods actually have enough angular resolution to pin down the locations of these molecules quite specifically so this is how we find molecules remotely but how do we talk about molecules in space from observations on the earth there we have to rely on luck we have to rely on meteorites that land to earth now meteorites depending on their origin are typically samples of deep space and at their best their primordial samples of the solar system that condensed or formed their rocky material very early on close to the formation time four and a half billion years ago perhaps the most famous and still very useful for research purposes meteorite is the murchison meteorite which fell to earth in victoria australia in 1969. now meteorites fall to earth every year and there are many that are as big as this one and some that are much bigger so what was special about the murchison meteorite what was special was that it fell in a very arid part of the australian desert and it was seen and recovered without contamination literally within hours of its fall the problem with meteorites as samples of the distant universe or the distant solar system is that as soon as they hit the earth's surface or enter the earth's atmosphere even they begin to be contaminated by terrestrial material with the merchants and meteorite it was found so quickly and protected from the earth's atmosphere and from contamination by humans that it has provided enormous amount of information in labs around the world over time and actually as the analysis techniques have got better people continue to get new information for the merchants and meteorite well this meteorite showed that it contained amino acids alcohols purines and pyrimidines which are found as components of dna and a number of other complex compounds some of the amino acids found in the merchants and meteorite are not amino acids used in life itself and that's not surprising in fin in theory and in principle there are a hundred thousand different amino acids possible and life only uses 20 of those so some of the amino acids found in the murchison were those amino acids that biology and the earth uses and some were not equally important is the handedness of the molecules molecules with a shape can have a handedness like a glove being left or right handed molecules in the merchants and meteorite were found equally in the left and right handed versions whereas terrestrial life has used only one handedness of the two possible versions each of which are chemically identical in the way they behave this represents an efficiency of biology given two choices to settle on one set of interactions with one shape of molecules the fact that murchison had equal number of both shapes does indicate that it doesn't represent living material itself what about water water is really important for life it ranges in its composition or and its fraction in living an organic material by a large factor in jellyfish it's about 99 of their composition in the driest bug you might find in an arid place it's down around 30 percent humans are in the middle at about 60 percent or two thirds but water is essentially a significant percentage of all biological life if you're thinking in evolutionary terms life on earth on the land surface migrated to the land about half a billion years ago after originating in water and so we're still carrying around sacks of water the water that life formed on very early on in the history of the earth why water or what is special about water that it would be a base ingredient for life water is particularly good for facilitating interactions and biological mechanisms first of all water is a solvent and so you can dissolve many chemicals and minerals in water this is standard in chemistry anyone studying chemistry is very familiar with this what that means is if you have a body of water many things can dissolve in it and interact and then form other combinations so water forms a rich basis for chemical complexity because of the way it dissolves and facilitates interactions now this is a double edged sword because in biology as biochemists are aware of water also can have an effect of destroying important molecules so while it facilitates interactions and combinations in some situations it actually is a solvent and dissolves those compounds so biology has had to fight against that current to gain complexity in the presence of water the cells inside our body are little water sacs little chemical factories filled with concentrated chemicals and those chemicals have been concentrated in a water medium water also facilitates basic biological processes like transferring nutrients from one part of a cell to another and eliminating wastes from a cell it's also quite stable as a molecule over a range of temperatures that are conducive to biological life so its thermal and physical properties essentially act to buffer physical extremes of temperature and pressure and so protect life and give it a narrow comfortable range of parameters to work in water is abundant in the solar system the earth may be the water world of the solar system but it's certainly not unique we also have europa which is the watery moon of jupiter found by galileo with the first telescope and that water world actually is completely covered by oceans under an ice cap and rivals perhaps in total the amount of water on the earth's surface a much larger planet we also think there are bodies of water under the surface of mars very recent radar measurements of the mars south polar cap have shown that there are liquid bodies of water and they're kept liquid by pressure from the surface rock and ice and by mild radioactive heating from the interior we also think mars has subsurface aquifers more limited bodies of water that can occasionally erupt onto the surface this map here is essentially a water map of mars done with spectroscopic techniques and if you took the full census or inventory of water on mars most of which is in the form of ice because of its cold temperature and were able to melt it it would form a puddle on the whole planet about four centimeters deep that's not maybe as impressive as the earth's oceans but it's a substantial amount of water we also have the situation of enceladus a surprise a few decades ago when we saw icy geysers streaming out into space this tiny moon about the size of rhode island was not on anyone's radar in astrobiology as a potential site for life and yet it appears to have liquid water because these icy geysers almost certainly result from pressurized liquid water erupting through the surface how does a tiny little moon generate the situation for liquid water especially so far from the sun where the temperature is very cold in this case it's because of a mild amount of geological heating from the interior rock and that rock is additionally heated by tidal forces from its host planet essentially jupiter acts to squeeze all of the moons that orbit it with elliptical orbits and that adds quite a lot of heat to the rock which can liquefy water or melt ice under the surface water could not exist on the surface of moons this far from the sun other models of planetary bodies in the solar system in particular moons of giant planets suggest that in total there may be a dozen moons of giant planets including moons of uranus and neptune where there is water kept liquid under a crust of ice and rock that's a dozen places with liquid water in the solar system so it's by no means just the earth we also know with very recent observations that water has been detected in the atmosphere of a handful of exoplanets the way this is done is with a clever experiment which backlights the exoplanet with its parent star and then does spectroscopy of light filtering through the atmosphere seen in illumination like this along the limb essentially the atmosphere imprints a set of molecular transitions from the ingredients in that atmosphere and so in a handful of cases water has been detected this way now these are all quite hot exoplanets so in these cases the water is steam so steam in the atmosphere of an exoplanet no observations are yet able to detect a water surface body on an exoplanet that's some distance away but we do know of situations where the exoplanet has properties where liquid water could exist on its surface even if we can't measure it yet when we're thinking of the ingredients for life biologists consider two are essential one is water water is essential for life because objects like us and all biological species plants and animals consist of water from a third to ninety percent water water facilitates chemical reactions and the basic functions of a cell and also water is quite widely abundant in the universe it's one of the most abundant molecules in the universe and it exists not just on the earth but probably in subterranean situations and about a dozen objects in the solar system water has been seen in distant galaxies for example at distances of billions of light years the other core ingredient is carbon carbon has chemical properties that facilitate reactions with other atoms and molecules and carbon and hydrogen in particular can form long chains and loops and form essentially infinitely complex molecules so as a basis for biological complexity carbon is truly special and as we know from our study of stellar evolution carbon is abundant in the universe so these two key ingredients for biology do appear to be universal [Music] you
