[Music] so thank you um yeah I'm here to talk about a different kind of biosignature um to introduce assembly Theory I don't know if this is the right group to be very controversial about it with or if you guys all accept it so we're gonna we're gonna see what happens um but mostly the main reason I'm a fan of this Theory the reason really talked about it is that there's two major problems that is currently in the field of astrobiology at least from my opinion um the first one is that we don't have a universal definition of life um again not sure if you guys agree with this or if that's really controversial no idea um but honestly we don't know what we're looking for out elsewhere and because of that kind of the biochemistry that we see or could potentially see we have no idea what that could look like comparison on Earth so kind of what we need to do is find a universal pattern of life first and then build our detection methods based on that um I think going out there seeing what we see is incredibly useful incredibly interesting but then you end up with like a phosphine problem of how do we explain what we see um if we determine what we're looking for first and then build a method based on that Universal Property we're able to be a little more stringent a little more um a little more robust about what we're actually finding so given that given that kind of solution um the basic idea of assembly theory is that life produces complex things um for example if we were to go to Enceladus and find an iPhone sitting on the bottom of the ocean um somehow unless Steve Jobs flew on a plane and put it there um we would say something Enceladus made a complex thing made it made an iPhone um that's weird that's interesting that would certainly be a really interesting battle signature um especially if we saw thousands of them if it was littered in iPhones there'd be some kind of process on Enceladus that would create and select for a complex object so this kind of idea is that life makes complex things it makes a lot of them and what assembly Theory does is specifically measure that give a measure of the complexity good measure of how much memory is part of the system that makes something really complex in a lot of it so kind of what this is what we're talking about is specifically it's a number of joining steps required to build an object from a base set of fragments that's a lot of words that's really confusing um so start with Legos and we'll go up from there um if you were to make this thing like this big Square rectangle whatever thing you would start with this green and green and red block and you would start joining them together in the most optimal way possible essentially the way that minimizes the joining steps to make that thing at the end um specifically there's five of them here you notice that you reuse this double a couple times and you reuse the square once as well so you're able to reuse the thing you already make there's five joining steps the ma of this particular Lego block will be five um and you can do this for lots of different things you can do this for Strings like Gage was talking about um yesterday where if you want to make Abracadabra you're going to have a number of steps particularly seven you're going to reuse Abra along the way and you can do this for chemicals which is kind of more astrological relevance um you're able to start with your base fragments in this case it's a element a bond and a different elements which is defined by the thing you're looking for and you're able to build up the steps along the way I think one thing I want to emphasize is that these steps don't necessarily have any physical meaning like this windmill guy isn't maybe maybe you can't make this in a lab who knows um and it doesn't particularly matter for this metric um this is not what I'm saying this is a physical property it's a theoretical way of reusing the symmetry of the object that you're ending up with so kind of keep that in mind um when you're doing this this is all from paper in 2021 from Stuart Marshall and Cole Mathis both at the University of Glasgow and we're able to do ma over a ton of things um and unsurprisingly correlates with molecular weights because as things get bigger you get more steps to make them but it's not a one to one ratio there's a lot of things kind of here that are high molecular weight below assembly Theory because they have high symmetry um so they're not necessarily as complex they require less steps to make um just again keep that in mind and the reason why we're so excited about this the reason why we want to use this for an astrobiological signature is that when you look at these compounds in a mass spec um you're able to see a lot of these different Peaks a mass spec takes a compound fragments it based on ionization a lot of different things there's lots of ways to do it this one particularly was an orbitrap so if fragments things twice and you end up with a number of different Peaks now kind of notice there's a correlation the lower things the lower ma things the less complex things don't have as many Peaks as the higher complex things um again kind of make sense bigger things are more complex there's a really strong correlation between the two which is really really exciting again it's not intuitively obvious that you have a theoretical measure that has no correlation physical reality actually corresponds to a mass spec signature um so when we saw this we kind of ran with this and we're saying hey we can put a mask back in space we've done it before we've done it since the 1970s so why don't we look at what kind of mass specs are needed think about ma as a specific bio signature and then um use Mass Spec to go out and find it and the thing we're looking for specifically again from this 2021 paper is that all of biochemistry has an MA greater than 15. um anything below 15 at least we see on Earth is a mixture of biotic abiotic things they're found throughout the geosphere and everything but above 15 is only things made by things that we know are alive um like whiskey a few other things they kind of had some fun at Glasgow measuring a bunch of stuff but essentially anything above 15 what we say is hey this from what we know about life on Earth let's extrapolate it to be a universal property that's something that's complex um for the rest of the talk I think just 15 it might be a little fuzzy I also measured 20. um I consider 20 as about as a specific bio signature so you'll see two numbers later on um that's where the 20 comes from is just give it a little wiggle room so now the issue with that if we're going to send a mass back into space it needs to be high resolution um you can't have something like this or you only have a couple Peaks you need something that has the right number of peaks in order to find something that's high and complex um if you find something send something that's low resolution it's not going to be good enough um so and when we look at stuff today you'll see this chart a couple times so we want to explain it real fast this is essentially um M over Z ratio essentially a measure of how big the molecule is and this is the mass resolution of the particular object times 10 000. um all of these ones off here are off the chart like they just have really have Big M over Z ratios and these two would have a really high resolution um so this is good now these things take up rooms um like an orbit traps not that big but you need a bunch of vacuum stuff like it's about as big as this Podium roughly if you want a really good one um you can't just launch that on a spaceship NASA gets really mad when you launch something that big so how do we like the stuff we do today it's roughly down here um Ricky ravalo's group in University Maryland College Park um has this mini orbitrap that's decent but still like not still on that scale um so how could how good can we get how is that good enough how much do we need in order to determine definitively that you have a mass spec signal stick signature um so what we did we did some chemical enumeration we built some graphs um specifically built some formulas and said hey given a specific number of chemicals this case Zero to six carbons any number of hydrogens the nitrogen Oxford phosphorus sulfur how many different formulas do we get how big is the chemical space that could potentially be out there answer is pretty big you've got lots of different formulas unsurprising um they can be modeled with a normal normal curve so I can do this for any number of upper limit and any number like up to 10 atoms up to five atoms if I want to measure more I can do a different normal curve um at this next slide might trigger people I apologize I did random chemistry based on that because again we don't know what that is going to look like so I built random I built random structures from random formulas essentially building putting random bonds together this might not exist this probably doesn't exist anywhere but um I kind of hope it doesn't because that would be weird um but what we what we did is we built it we put it through Rd kits 3D and better software so we know this is at least physically possible it doesn't break the rules of physics the thermodynamics are really weird who knows how long this lasts but again our assumptions we don't know what this looks like um and this actually is a good assumption you'll see a few graphs later that we're not actually that far off from reality but um just bear with me for now so I did this for 10 000 different structures um made a bunch of made a bunch of random chemicals and found the m a of them so if molecular weights we have assembly index and you see that most of them started to get high Ma and you get a likelihood very quickly of well what is the likelihood of finding a high ma object at a particular molecular weight so we have number we have the size of chemical space we have molecular weights and we know how often those things are high m a we're essentially able to then put that on a Precision curve and say what's the Precision which can be translated into resolution of the particular number of chemical species that have a high ma in that case or that particular M over Z ratio we take the integral of that particular line our goal is to find 10 or fewer just to put a number on it and then we end up with something looks like this um so our in an ideal case what we have is something about 552 000 M over Delta M Mass resolution Which is far fewer than what we have in commercial orbitraps those are on the orders like Millions 10 Millions um but it's not what we've sent to space it's about four times better than what we've sent the space so far um those ones we send so those ones set into space are decent like in this little curve here they're good they're able to determine highma molecules but we still want to get as high up on this graph as possible um so it's more of an engineering challenge this is more saying hey Engineers if you can go out and build something like this give an unknown chemical space we're confident that you'll be able to detect a high ma molecule if it's out there um and quickly just to finish up um I know the chemicals were really bad and really not Earth like um so we determined our spacecraft our sermon our resolution based on existing chemistry we used keg keto Encyclopedia of genes of genomes I'm mostly saying how good is our prediction based on those random chemicals this is MOMA this is the one that's launching soon to Mars um it's not that great at distinguishing formulas um there's a lot of overlaps but if you look at something like corals or our recommended one you're not you're really not that bad you're getting maximum of five so it's pretty good um and even better when we start saying hey does random chemistry correspond with reality um it does thankfully um kind of as a test we took 200 formulas from that formal enumeration um got a hundred different isomers of those formulas but from pubchem so existing chemistry GDB which from John Louise Raymond's group and burn which is a generated database of potential chemistry here on Earth and then random structure generation like we did and if they were separate we'd say we have a problem but all of these kind of the m a space of all those chemicals is about the same so we actually end up roughly a recommendation on random chemistry seems to be sufficient based on life we see today um so kind of a recommendation if we take this metal micro assembly Theory as a biosignature we have a mass range of mass specs to shoot for we have a resolution and it's a worst case scenario and what we're showing is that this roughly represents m a of chemical space um there's lots of people to thank um mostly the ASU group that is mostly sitting at the front table so thank you very much thank you John any questions felt all freaked out by the chemistry hi great talk um I'm wondering why is the random set smaller on the area that it takes than a pumpkin yeah um that is a that's a great question um I think my answer is that it's possibly a sampling issue of random space is probably bigger but the density of different compounds that it could sample in random chemistry is just so high on that little part right there like I'm just not sampling enough to get a distribution um or or or I am and I'm not um getting the edges as much um I think it's interesting question of how life can be a little more spread out I think there's an interesting function a functionality argument going on um I think yeah random chemistry I think it's so dense in the middle that I'm just not exploring the edges as well as I could be thanks hi uh this is very very interesting so um I guess would you mind uh maybe going over the um uh basically what led you to your resolution and um and uh Max M over Z calculations a little bit uh I guess more in detail uh about how that connects to um msms uh measurements is is this um just with M over Z or okay yeah so um yeah it's a great question so I'm not assuming any fragmentation here um mostly because we don't know exactly what we're going to send or if it's an ms1 or MS2 machine um so I'm just assuming that there's a there's a particular structure it's ionized so I knock off a hydrogen and then that's a single Peak that you get what's the resolution to distinguish those Peaks um which one thing is worst case add fragmentation and add like a really add a decent orbitrap and this probably becomes a lot better but it's hard to predict exactly what that fragmentation is um there's a team in Glasgow um led by Emma kyrick that's like trying to figure that out right now um as you can imagine it's a difficult like Mass specs are weird um it's a difficult problem to predict and extrapolate yeah because I guess I'm wondering you know obviously um ion neutral Mass spectrometer and Cassini did not have nearly this resolution uh but if the fragmentation that you can assume happened when those ice grains collided with it um could be assumed to be an MS2 like event then and if that you know if MS2 makes it that much better then maybe you could look at it from this perspective yeah no I didn't I think if he hadn't I think I would love to see a number of how much that correlates um yeah I think that's the I think that's probably the next step on where to go with this yeah absolutely okay uh we could probably take one more question and you're the lucky man right next to me it's a very interesting talk uh you talked about the lower limit on Ma is there any upper limit on Ma so like under up a little bit of how far biochemistry can go yeah um it's a great question so it quickly so we're using it so far in small small molecules we're not using this in peptides or anything mostly because the base fragments that we're talking about in this case are elements to bonds and we talked like something like DNA molecule then Things become so massive so massive that since it's an NP complex NP complete problem it that'll take forever to compute um so I think like it quickly depends on your definition of a base fragment and what you want your what you want those joining steps to be um it's essentially DNA I imagine would be in tens of millions if not higher if we're using this particular definition um freezing amino acids or base pairs Things become a little different um I have some interesting results in like patent chemistry that I'm happy to share afterwards to show like we have a little bit of upper limit of like what chemistry can look like but um I mean that's more of a computational limit than anything thanks a lot yeah absolutely [Applause] [Music]
