[Music] in this lecture we consider communication because if we're thinking of our place in the universe and we wonder if there are others like us out there then the only way we would know about it is by communication let's bring this down to earth with a current example one of our spacecraft that has now left the solar system launched in 1977 is a message in a bottle tossed into the cosmic ocean now having left the solar system at a distance of billions of miles from the earth nasa attached to the leg of the voyager 1 spacecraft a golden record or rather a record analog record with a gold cover on the top to protect it it has greetings in 55 languages welcome from the un secretary general various selections of music and a three dimensional map of the location of our sun relative to 14 pulsars in known directions where their frequencies are marked in binary code on the sight lines this of course designed to tell an alien who might retrieve this record where we live carl sagan was behind this project along with a group of eminent scientists and he said the spacecraft will be encountered and the record only played if there are advanced space faring civilizations in interstellar space but launching of this bottle into the cosmic ocean says something very hopeful about life on this planet clearly and by projection it will take tens of thousands of years at its current speed for this spacecraft to reach even the nearest star system it's not a practical attempt at communication it's more of a metaphor of a message in a bottle and it's more of a sense of ourselves in fact some people criticized it for being an analog technology you may have noticed that digital technology has taken over on the earth so this is an obsolete technology soon after it was launched the people who designed it actually pushed back because there's pretty good evidence that our digital technologies degrade with time and many will not survive decades whereas the analog etched technology of a record in space protected as it was will actually endure for tens of thousands of years so we've sent a message into space a simple primitive attempt to communicate but far more effective far more efficient and we believe far more universal in terms of the use by other intelligent entities out in space is to communicate using electromagnetic radiation electromagnetic radiation has been harnessed by humans in terms of visible light for centuries and the expanded electromagnetic spectrum has been opened up in the last century of our technology electromagnetic radiation is the best medium for communicating across vast distances because it travels at the fastest speed known to physics the speed of light three hundred thousand kilometers per second far faster than any other signaling it can also travel through the vacuum of space there's no formal limit on the distance radiation can travel it does diminish in intensity by the inverse square law if sent out in all directions but if beamed or pulsed as with a laser it can travel enormous distances through space and by pulsing the radiation on very short time scales information can be coded into the light and there's essentially no practical limit to the amount of information that we can be coded so this is our best means and method of communication either by speaking or by listening we can look at the history of our own stumbling attempts to communicate and how quickly they've moved on from their early days analog communication was very primitive in europe at the time of the copernican revolution it might take months for people to travel a small distance across europe from one country to the next even 100 years ago in the early days of the mail service by pony express it might take 10 days for a letter to go from coast to coast in the united states and transatlantic communications would take weeks or months finally in the mid 19th century the first cable is laid under the ocean across the atlantic and communication that used to take weeks suddenly takes only minutes morse code was an early form of electromagnetic communication but it was still analog in its mode of digitization and it was still tethered to wires or cables so there's a long history of development of communication technology it really starts with james clark maxwell in the mid 19th century this scottish physicist formalized the laws by which electromagnetic radiation can be created transmitted and carried through space including through a vacuum this is the profound theoretical insight that eventually enables us to use electromagnetic communication the foundations of this stem from marconi's experiments early in the 20th century to use radio waves and eventually in a series of progressions through the 20th century we have the communication that we're now familiar with using electromagnetic waves to essentially communicate instantaneously across the earth's surface when the first astronauts went to the moon there was that slight halting moment in their conversation caused by the second or so time delay of electromagnetic waves traveling that large distance to the moon and back but for all intents and purposes on the earth this is instant communication and of course now humans are networked and webbed together by satellites and cell phones to expect instant communication as a routine part of their lives prior to wireless communication physical hardware was required and electronics before transistors involving valves to transfer information from one location to another the invention of wireless communication is clearly foundational in modern society as we understand it and our lives depend on it in ways that we don't even think about but we imagine that that transition from wired to wireless communication might have been followed by any civilization that's interested in communicating quickly and efficiently astronomers of course use wireless communication and electromagnetic waves to communicate everywhere they can especially within the solar system where we now send space probes all the way to pluto and all the way into mercury we use radiation to travel these distances and the solar system is big enough that these travel times for electromagnetic waves can be hours or even days the voyager spacecraft has now been traveling for 40 years and 10 months and it is a phenomenal 13 billion miles away from the earth it's traveling at a small fraction of the speed of light but its signals come back to us at light speed its feeble transmitters eventually will be too dim for us to detect and will lose sight and sound of these messages in a bottle so in the long span of human civilization it took a long time for humans or early humans or pre humans to develop agriculture and then it took another 10 millennia for us to develop the technology to communicate through space there's an upward arc in this progress and indeed an acceleration we live in a time of exponentiation improvement in technology as time goes by and it's an open question whether this is a transition and a rate of progress that would be seen in other civilizations on other planets in the universe so the question comes how many alien civilizations might develop the technology to communicate in space using the fastest and most efficient method of electromagnetic radiation we have only one example our own and right away you see the weakness of all this thinking because we have no way of powerfully using logic to argue our conclusion if there are ten planets that evolve intelligent civilizations that all eventually develop interstellar communication that fraction could be one but if there are ten planets and only one develops interstellar communication that fraction is point one a conservative guess might be that only one in ten civilizations ever developed this capability but the fraction could be much lower we simply don't know and so we're thrust immediately into the huge uncertainty of wondering how often what happened with us has happened out there in space communicating through the universe to understand our place in the universe and whether we have counterparts elsewhere requires efficient and effective modes of communication it took humans a long time to develop the modes of communication that we now take for granted in our current civilization these methods use wireless communication of course and they rely on the transmission of electromagnetic waves traveling at 300 000 kilometers per second the fastest conceivable way in physics to transmit information from a to b or across the universe we imagine any civilization elsewhere would use electromagnetic waves to communicate but it's an assumption and we have no idea if civilizations all develop this [Music] capability
