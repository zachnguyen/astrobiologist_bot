[Music] all right Hi I'm Evelyn I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto and I'd like to talk about some simulation work that I've been doing with my collaborators they're funded by answer so I work on Emirates which for the purposes of this talk I'm defining as roughly earth sized rocky planets in the habitable zone of an M dwarf star and so because because the star is small the planet is close to the Stars so we assume it's totally locked um so this this diagram over here just kind of shows what that looks like so we have the Stars somewhere over here um light from the Star hitting the planet at the substellar point which is always at the same place because the planet has a permanent day and night side and the Terminator is kind of a cool word for the dividing line between the day side and the night side so just kind of keep that in mind I'll be using some of these terms now the base assumption is that these planets have what we call an eyeball climate so again we have the star here um the assumption is that the night side is frozen and part of the day side is unfrozen near the sub Stellar point where it receives the most radiation and you would assume that's a circle this is actually an oversimplification but it's kind of a good starting point so I have a few questions that I'd like to be trying to answer today first of all how does land configuration affect Emirates climates how does the mass of the atmosphere affect their climates I'll be answering those using a 3D GCM General circulation model called exoplasm and then the next part is can we tell these climates apart and observations I'll be using a radiative transfer model based on my exoplasm simulations to look into that so to start I like to talk about land configuration and so if the recall the eyeball climate we kind of have a cartoon of this here the idea is what happens if we put land in that warm deglaciated region because that's the region that's probably the most interesting but what's going on in the surface there um should have a climate effect presumably so I've done this in a systematic way um as I'm showing over here basically we have two opposite content configurations where either all of the land is in a circle at the substellar point so that's the substellar continent over here with ocean everywhere else and if if the ocean is cold there's ice instead of open water and then the opposite substellar ocean putting land everywhere except for a circle at the substellar point where there's water um and we vary the size of the circle in all of these simulations going from zero to a hundred percent so here you can see that sometimes there's ice free ocean and sometimes there's not and these ones there's always some ice free ocean because of where the water is so now what what happens to the climate when we run the climate model with these there's a lot going on here so let's let's just take it slowly on the on the left here we have substellar continent models with different land fractions so this First Column is the land map just looking straight down at the center of the day side with the night side not shown um and the second column here shows the precipitation and evaporation so red is evaporation blue is precipitation you'll notice it always rains at the substellar point and water evaporates from the ocean everywhere else on the day side and this is true for these ones these substellar Ocean Models as well you get clouds and precipitation in the middle of the day side and over ocean regardless of where the land is so the water comes toward the center of the planet where it's warmest Rises it condenses out and you get rain so we also get kind of a range of of temperatures depending on how much land there is with high land fraction planets having hot and dry day sides which is what's shown in this column here so these are some pretty significant climate differences um like on a spatially resolved level this is what this looks like globally on the x axis we have dayside land fraction so the size of of the circle for these two landmap types and on the y axis we have temperature on the left and water vapor on the right um you'll notice that there's the largest discrepancy between the two partial dayside land cover so when it when it's not an aquaplanet or a land Planet somewhere in between it really matters a lot where the land is because that influences the amount of ice free ocean that's available on the planet for evaporation and putting moisture into the atmosphere and these curves kind of follow each other so this is already a climate uncertainty that we need to kind of think about um now let's make it more complicated by changing another parameter the mass of the atmosphere so like land configuration that's not necessarily something we can know about a planet in advance so I varied it in my simulations the idea is basically make the atmosphere thicker or smaller that's what I've tried to show over here and these are the same curves that were on the previous slide but this time for a range of pressures so increasing the amount of N2 in the atmosphere and again you get the same land fraction and land configuration dependence but in addition to that the curves are shifted up or down depending on the pressure so they overlap it's very confusing um we like there's clearly some climate effects here that need to be paid attention to and so then the next thing we want to know is can we ever know this stuff can we tell these apart in observations so the way these planets will be observed is with Transit spectroscopy which is what jwst will do um I have a kind of image of what that looks like basically when the planet passes between the Observer and the star it blocks out some of the Stars light which is measurable and there's a wavelength dependent contribution to the amount of light blocked depending on the molecules in the atmosphere and where they scatter and absorb So based on what wavelengths block the most light we can tell what's in the atmosphere this is really hard to do for small planets but this is like the theory of it so the question then because most of the water if you'll recall was at the sub Stellar point is how much water is making it to the Terminator because the Terminator um sorry the the Terminator is where like we're getting actually the photons from we can't directly image the substellar point so we're getting the light passing through the Terminator so I have some profiles here of specific humidity for the two different types of land map this is just all at the same pressure basically we have pressures so going upward in the atmosphere on the y axis and specific humidity on the x axis for near the substellar point and near the Terminator so looking her relationship between the amount of water in the Rainy Zone and the amount of water we can see um subcellular Ocean Models all look pretty much the same which makes sense there's water there there's a bit less of the Terminator but it's still there for the substellar continent models the ones with a lot of land have much less water at the Terminator but still some so maybe we can tell the difference so now I've I'd like to show some synthetic Transit Spectra I've made using only water so I've ignored all other possible things that could contribute to this so on the x axis we have wavelength that the instrument is observing at and on the y axis we have what I've defined as amplitude so basically the difference between the transit depth that you get so the amount of light block from the star and the minimum amount so either the amount just by the rocky planet itself or the lowest cloud deck or the lowest part that that would be visible because it's really this difference that we're looking to measure more so than the actual size of the planet itself so these are just for a few selected simulations from my parameter space and so varying only the land and the pressure we get quite a sizable difference in these water vapor spectral features so these could these are kind of a range of what a specific Planet might produce um then on the bottom we have the Cloudy version so these same ones but with clouds included in the radiative transfer and you'll notice that the features are smaller but also they're not all affected the same way depending on where like how many how many clouds are at the Terminator which varies depending on different factors so it's a bit confusing um I'd like to just focus on on this feature though so I'd like to show like basically the top of this feature for a variety of models and that's what this looks like on the left we have the cloud free version on the right we have with clouds included um again these curves kind of follow the same shape as the temperature and water vapor from a few slides ago but when you add clouds it gets a lot worse unfortunately basically there's there's like some correlations in a cloud free version these high pressure low land models have much taller spectral features so you might be able to detect that or tell the difference but then when we add clouds what happens is that these Waters these models with the most water vapor are also the cloudiest of the Terminator and consequently theme like the effect of clouds on a spectrum is much higher so like that it gets like artificially subdued so it looks like these dry models over here have the most water but that's not actually true so observing this it's going to be very hard to tell what's going on on the surface of the planet um just try to end on a happy note um there's a huge range of climates here we can't necessarily tell them apart but a lot of them could be habitable and we might be able to detect water in some of them so like I'm still like cautiously optimistic I guess but it's it's more important I think to account for the fact that there are these unknowns instead of just trying to make assumptions about what's going on on the surface of the planet based on its Transit Spectrum I'll stop here and I'm happy to take any questions [Music] [Applause] hi uh great talk um really interesting stuff so I'm wondering about you have these simulated spec Transit Spectra I'm and it looks a little uh pessimistic based on how close those lines are but jwst has been delivering some exquisitely Precision precise Spectra so I'm wondering if you have plans to model like the noise properties and stuff and it like actually simulate jwst observations of these kind of things to see if you can actually distinguish maybe a few things because the trans inspector are so precise um because of this incredible instrument that we have yeah it would be good to add some instrumental noise to them it's also really hard to do that accurately um there's like it's it's harder to get precise Spectra for these smaller stars like most of what's been coming so far is or sorry smaller planets bigger bigger planets are easier to get like good data from but yeah there's um there's more Photon noise in the far or mid infrared compared to the near infrared so I think it'd be good to focus on that but yeah it would be like it might be possible to tell some of them apart but it would be a good thing to look into thanks for the question Taylor plattner at Georgia Tech great talk also just wanted to say all the other talks were very interesting this morning um and it's super cool I used to do exoplanet stuff when I was in undergrad so you're taking me back to I guess my old days sounds like I'm an old person um but uh I had a question on you know I know you're doing simulations but are you going to eventually like look at specific planets and if so do you have like a I don't know there's kind of like I used to do this like a development like a prototype um instrument to put on ground based telescope to like vet out interesting planets so I didn't know if you had like a I don't know anything to like vet out interesting planets to you like with jwst or with any other like telescope um sorry if that's a terrible question but just curious no it's an interesting I'm not an observer I'm mostly just waiting excitedly for other people to get data and like I would say the one I'm most excited about is probably Travis 20 but excited and apprehensive at the same time because it'll be really sad if they don't find an atmosphere on it but yeah ground ground based observations would be like another good way to to look at these planets because you can get such a bigger telescope okay this is with jwst how often is it like looking at like if you had some planner that you're really interested in how often is it like looking at that planet or would you like I don't know I know Tess was another one that people like were really excited about so I didn't know if that was easier to like get data like to see that same Planet more and I know it yeah like you were saying it's not as great everybody loves JW wst for a reason yeah well Tess is a planet finder so it it's found a bunch of candidates so like anything that starts with toi I mean tests object of Interest what they're called um and then jwst is kind of needed or like some large telescope is needed for follow up to actually characterize their atmospheres because it's much easier to find the planets than to see what's in their atmospheres especially with such thin ones uh did that answer the question yeah yeah good talk thank you thank you so much okay we have time for one quick question hi that was also super I'm pretty far removed from this exoplanet stuff because this is sick so um I I have a question that I apologize for my inability to ask a more specific question about your work that's just a lack of my understanding but um I'm curious that they were talking about how like this Exquisite Precision with jwst and and all this stuff and so is how far off well I'll preface by saying um the past couple of decades as I'm sure you're aware our understanding of planetary habitability has really shifted with the uh our increased understanding of these icy moons in our solar system and things like that um how far off is our ability to examine moons of exoplanets given like a small enough star or something like that or is that just like so far off from reality given their technological abilities at the moment I would say it's that's far off unforged like yeah the problem is that that you have to like detect the planet and then the moon going around the planet and it's they're just really hard to find and they'll be even harder to observe which is unfortunate because I bet EXO moons are really cool and that would also deal with the tidal locking problem like like if an exumun was orbiting it's tidally locked Planet the moon will not be totally locked to the star so it could have day night cycles but they're just really hard to observe yeah thanks for that that would be really cool thank you for the talk everyone well thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
