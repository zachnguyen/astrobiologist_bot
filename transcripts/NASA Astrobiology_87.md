what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind it is the fact that inside every one of your cells you have little uh molecular machines that are climbing ladders literally you know protein ladders and moving they're like tow trucks and they climb they move along those ladders and they carry big blobs of you know ATP with them um I think they're called actin machines and they're just you know you can find videos of them they are the most EX extraordinary device molecular devices and they're inside of every one of your cells the the the ability of life to innovate on a molecular level which is why any of us are here I think is just it's you know it's hard not to be in awe of it
