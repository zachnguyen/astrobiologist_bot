with all of our guests we have on the show we really like to know what what got you started I wasn't a kid who grew up looking through telescopes and and wondering about the stars and the night sky I grew up with my eyes very firmly planted to the ground and when I say that I mean I was really interested in dinosaurs from a very young age I was really obsessed with dinosaurs and I came across a book that talked in detail about the asteroid the Earth at the end of the Cretaceous Period so the kpg extinction event that we know it today oh that's really interesting what is it about this asteroid I was really intrigued by this thing that was more powerful than the dinosaurs you know what what is it about them so started taking all these planetary science classes learned about potentially hazardous asteroids which are still potential threats to our own Survival and got into planetary Sciences from from that perspective
