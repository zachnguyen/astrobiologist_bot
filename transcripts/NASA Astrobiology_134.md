[Music] hello everyone I'm Paola researcher from Lithuania currently located at Santa Cruz and my professor is Dave dimmer so organic compounds including building blocks of life may be synthesized in the accretion disk of newly forming solar system and may fall down to earth as a meteorites and thus phosphates ribose and all nuclear bases were all found in meteorites and under certain conditions May recombine into your nucleotides which are present in all contemporary life another essential compound is lipid which is a membrane forming molecule and the simple lipids were also found in carbonaceous chondrites and even though their structure was way more simple they can form vesicles so if these compounds fall down to the oceans they are lost in a dilute buffer but if we make it down to the surfaces of volcanic landmass they get a shot at Birth participating in the origin of life so compounds falling in from space synthesized in the biogenic atmosphere cooked up in hydrothermal systems or through work very through rock bevering may accumulate on the surface perhaps finding their way in a volcanic caldera the key to getting things to interact is concentration so small hot spring pools may be perfect place to go come cook up some soup of life and hydrothermal fields of interconnected pools could not only concentrate the compounds but intermix them between reservoirs subjecting them to different temperature pH uh Elemental and my mineral compositions and for any system to move from simple to more complex one is it must be subject to cycling and the flows of compounds including building blocks of membranes and polymers may find their way into a pool which fills up by a pulse from nearby geyser dries down and fills up again a cycle or an engine oh engine oh sorry is then formed when a polymers between dry lipid layers are synthesized and during rehydration they may assemble into membrane bounded protocells and the stabilizing effects of polymers and membranes allow the protocells to be tested with some surviving next dry down as a protocell aggregate together they form gel like face where metabolic Cycles can arise and as a grade fully dries down the Proto cells can are merging and forming lamellar structures where polymers can resynthesize template and allocate so after many search Cycles simple biological functions can emerge which uh yeah a simple biological functions can emerge and these ideas are backed by many studies and here you can see a model of lasagna of life were nucleotides are trapped between layers of lipid membranes and such structures are confirmed by x ray diffraction experiment and the trapping of nucleotides between the layers are beneficial because uh search structures allow pre polymers to form and not only that here you can see that the blue lines are with lipid present and if we compo compare the deporination reactions which are degradation of purine nuclear nucleotides in the samples with lipid present those reactions are really inhibited uh if we cook up such lasagna at sufficiently high temperatures you can see in the last graph at 90 degrees of the nucleotides can really undergo condensation reactions and become well oligon are nucleotides so RNA or DNA like molecules and uh the most important message from all this presentation is that this is a real system like you can take your Prebiotic soup and go to Kamchatka or New Zealand or even in California the hot spring pools pour it down and after a couple of Cycles you will see like real Proto cells with oligonucleotides which are of sufficient length to already have enzymatic functions so my goal for a rest of air is to use nanopore sequencing to study those sequences to check whether I can find some functional ones so these ideas and results brought our team to a city where we are running a Genesis engine which is simulation chamber of volcanic land mass with a lot of poles where we can test the different conditions and our goal is to understand what fraction of habitable planets are actually durable and by durable I mean what fraction of habitat in what fraction of habitable planets the life can actually start not many people are talking about that but conditions for a life to start will be very different than the conditions which are needed for our life to thrive yes so if you are interested in this project you can learn more on a set website or and I invite you to stop by my poster where we can discuss how we can cook some soup of life and maybe even start the second Genesis so thank you very much [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]
