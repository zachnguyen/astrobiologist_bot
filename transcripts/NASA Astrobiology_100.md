if you could go back in time and visit yourself at the start of your career what kind of advice would you give I think I would tell myself to know that I belong and it's not up to other people to let me know that I belong it's something that I decide for myself uh that was something I struggled with for a long time and still struggle with and so being able to overcome that and have something in myself that brings me connectedness and brings me belonging I think would give me a lot of easier of a career and I hope that's something that other people can think about and it might help them as well with their career
