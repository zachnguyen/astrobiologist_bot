[Music] all right hello everyone how's it going my name's Sean I'm from the University of Maryland Baltimore County and today we're going to be looking at xenoamino acids a look into biochemistry as we don't know it so I'm going to fly through a lot of this because it's only a six minute talk but please come for feel free to come find me at my poster outside afterwards so my project attempts to merge Theory with experiment in order to test if a alternative amino acid set is capable of building protein structure now to do this we need to select a candidate alphabet from plausible Alternatives and from there use our collaborators over at the Charles University in Prague to build oligopeptides now I'm going to take a step back here and go over some very quick background um so all life on Earth since Luca has used the same set of 20 Alpha amino acids to construct metabolism now multiple disciplines agree that there were far more than 20 available for early evolution in the origins of life and over the last decade or so there's been um theoretical work that identifies a simple but statistical profile that distinguishes life's amino acids from Alternatives and that is that the 20 amino acids used by life exhibit a non random coverage of size and hydrophobicity when we Define coverage as the range of values in a set and with how and how they how evenly they distribute across that range so what do I mean by that exactly I want you to consider a set of five amino acids and pick any physical chemical descriptor this could be size this could be volume I'm sorry uh log P this could be charge and you're going to measure them rank order them and plot them on that axis from here what we can do is we can get the intervals between each amino acid and this ties into our our idea of coverage which breaks down into two components which is range and evenness so range is simply just the sum of these intervals between each amino acid and evenness is the sample variance of these intervals now this ties back into what I said the coded 20 amino acids are statistically non random in one in about two and a half million alternative alphabets would have the same or better coverage in size and hydrophobicity now why exactly are we looking at range and evenness well range allows for a broader diversity of structures and functions and evenness allows for the best approximation of any desired physical chemistry so I like to think of it as trying to recreate a black and white painting using a defined set of tiles and you need to pick which colors you want to use to try and get that painting as close as possible now range is effectively the difference between having black and white tiles versus just different Shades of Gray and evenness is among the black and white tiles having an even distribution going from black to white now why exactly are we looking at log p and volume log p is just a measure of hydrophobicity and hydrophobic collapse is crucial for protein folding and for volume volume determines the physical space that allows for protein folding so now that we have this idea of coverage in our mind I would like to very quickly go over our workflow I'm going to skip essentially everything except that top right corner where all we're doing is we have a heuristic search protocol that searches a library of purchasable amino acids and from there we are in a constant feedback loop with our empiricist collaborators in attempting to eventually get a candidate alphabet now I'm sure you are all dying to see what one of these alphabets look like right so here we go uh this is our current alphabet now big emphasis on current um because of that iterative feedback loop this is definitely subject to change and probably will change before we start constructing oligopeptides from a set but here is our first set um this is simply just one example of around 10 to the 14 possible High coverage sets that we could pick from so there are a lot of variation that we can change and play with with the empiricists now again the goal here is to synthesize these like a peptides from a completely non canonical set and that's hopefully what we'll be doing in a few weeks now I would like to very quickly end on a deeper note of who cares why would an advanced science to design an alternative amino acid set and I would like to kind of bring that question to this idea of is there such a thing as a good or bad amino acid alphabet now before the empiricists and the crowd jump out of their chairs and strangle me um yes the empiricists are saying of course there are bad amino acid sets the 20 are very good at what they do but theorists are pushing back a little bit and saying well you know Evolution can find any needle in any Haystack so I would like to believe that the the truth lies somewhere in between but what we're really trying to do here is begin to characterize good versus bad using an adaptation of 1980s behavioral thinking so optimality theory for life's amino acids now I'd like to conclude just by thanking our sponsors or I'm sorry our sponsors are funders and our collaborators over at the Charles University in Prague and if you would like to talk to me about this in much much greater depth please find me at poster 24 which is outside thank you all so much I really appreciate it [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]
