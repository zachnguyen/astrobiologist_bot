what stories have inspired you to want to learn more about life in the universe you know I think the story that most inspired me to want to learn about life in the universe is actually The Little Prince uh which is a story about a little prince who lives on an asteroid that's so small that he can just watch Sunset after Sunset after Sunset and a rose grows on his asteroid and she's so vain um and she wants so much from him that he ends up leaving to explore the rest of the universe and it's really a story about imagination and about creativity and how we think about ourselves and our place and where we are and so that book in particular I think is one that really strongly stuck with me as to why we want want to explore elsewhere and what it can bring to us personally to explore elsewhere
