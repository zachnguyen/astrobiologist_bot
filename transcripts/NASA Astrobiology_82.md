what stories have inspired you to want to know more about life in the universe oh my gosh when I was 12 years old in my hometown of Johnson City New York I was able to take books out of the adult section of the library and I had never heard of Science Fiction but it was in a separate section and so I just started at the A and read through and stay up late at night and so it just made me curious about possibilities but they all inspire me one of the books I read not too long ago was called the dictionary of lost words and it was about the team of men who wrote The Oxford English Dictionary and it took them decades but the protagonist in the story Esme is the daughter of one of these men and they're throwing out slips of paper with words they think should not go in the dictionary and she starts to collect them and ends up she actually becomes a very famous linguist as an adult so fiction really helps me think about new things
