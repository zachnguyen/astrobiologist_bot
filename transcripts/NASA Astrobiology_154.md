[Music] hi everyone so I'll be talking about Martian metabolism and biotic chlorate reduction in Mars analog environments on Earth so uh since the discovery of let's see if I can get this video since the discovery of perchlorate on Mars by the Phoenix Lander in 2008 it's been a compound of interest on the red planet this is due to its high oxidative potential on par with oxygen which means that it's a potential energy source for life on the red planet uh on Mars it's ubiquitous in Martian regolith reaching concentrations of 0.5 weight percentage um on Earth there are microbes that reduce perchlorate in place of oxygen and Metabolism using it to drive the electron transport chain and perchlorate accumulates in Mars analog systems on Earth such as the Atacama Desert where it reaches concentrations up to 0.18 percent as well as the Antarctic dry valleys where it reaches concentrations up to .0038 these are Mars analog systems that are incredibly dry and accumulate perchlorate via atmospheric deposition um over long time scales and uh they're likely uh looking at these systems it seems reasonable that per reducing microbes might evolve and persist in these types of environments however the model organisms that we use to study biotic perchlorate reduction don't come from Mars analog environments they come from the Potomac River in Washington DC where there's very little to no natural perchlorate that accumulates all the pcori that we do find here is um is waste from Munitions factories that gets dumped into the river so how did perchlorate reducing microbes arrive in this type of environment if they likely didn't evolve here due to the lack of perchloride well we know that the perchlorate reduction genomic island is widely spread via horizontal Gene transfer we know this because when we look at reducing organisms can you see my mouse yeah there we go um the elements required for biotic report reduction the genes that are required for court reduction um share a lot of homology between the genes but where the genes are situated in the genome is very diverse depending on the organism that you're looking at so it's a very chimeric metabolism so if we look here the the bright green that's chloride dismutates and this long dark green this perchlorate reductase they're always kind of in different configurations in relation to each other in uh in the genomic Island and that's because these individual elements are getting passed uh individually and um independently of one another via horizontal Gene transfer so you only get reducing microbes when these elements come together in the same organism so my research question was did canonical biotic reduction arise in these Mars analog environments like the atticama desert or Antarctic dry valleys and then disperse around the world via acellular and microbial dispersal so in order to test that I selected metagenoms from sites around the world the metagenome for those of you don't know is basically all the DNA in a sample it comes in little 20 base pair of chunks and you have to piece them together like a puzzle and then pick out the puzzles that you're interested in uh that maybe make a picture you're interested in and then uh and then analyze those independent of the rest of the metagenome so basically what I did is I selected metagenoms from sites around the world I analyzed the presence of reduction genes so basically build the little puzzles and then pulled out the the ones that made reducing genes and then I calculated the phylogenetic diversity of those genes at each site this is a study that has really up until this point been done only in humans which is this uh type of analysis where we look at diversity of a species or a gene to determine the likely places where it's persisted the longest that's how we know that humans come out of Africa is because most of our phylogenetic diversity can be accounted for in Africa so when I did this uh so this is for chloride dismutase a gene that's involved in per quart reduction I found the highest diversity to be in uh in the uh Antarctic dry Valley so what we're seeing here is these bars are are a scale that's Faith's phylogenetic diversity zero is basically zero diversity and then up to 50 would would be the maximum amount of diversity in these genes that we see and each of these blue dots is a separate metagenome um as you can see there's a little bit of sampling bias because in the anterior dry valleys or Atacama Desert we have a lot more sampling there's a lot more research that happens in these sites we've got a lot more metagenomes that I can analyze whereas if I look at other Mars analog sites like the Namib Desert there are quite a few less or in South Australian desert uh much less access to that kind of data when I looked at procore reductase another Gene involved in biotic proportion reduction we also see that it is it reaches highest levels in the Antarctic dry valleys so that basically indicates that these genes have persisted the longest in in these in this in these in these Mars analog ecosystems supporting the claim that these may have evolved and persisted in those Mars analog systems so some conclusions uh reduction genes are present and diverse in Mars analog systems that's really awesome right before we didn't even know if they could persist in Wars analog systems but it looks like they both evolve and persist there for long time scales this metabolism may have evolved in these environments and then uh prior to dispersing around the world via acellular and microbial dispersal and studying for core reducing organisms in Mars analog environments can give us further insight into how life may persist on the red planet uh when we're studying life forms that do metabolisms like what we expect to find on Mars we shouldn't be looking at organisms that come out of the Potomac River we should be looking at at organisms in these Mars analog systems so I'd like to hear some some people I'd like to thank so my funding which is the the NSF grant for long term ecological research at McMurdo Station uh my department at Brigham Young University as well as the help and advice of Dr John Coates at UC Berkeley Dr Kendall Kendall Lynch at the lunar and planetary Institute and Dr Jennifer glass at Georgia Tech so thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh wow [Music]
