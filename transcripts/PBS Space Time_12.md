what if the first genesis of life theabiogenesis is so unlikely that it only happened once in the entire galaxy andthat once was not on earth what if primitive life arrived on earthafter having traveled vast distances across the Milky Way some scientiststhink this may be the case this is the panspermia hypothesis there's somethingodd about the first appearance of life There's something odd about the first appearance of life on earth. The oldest fossils are now dated to only a few hundred million years after the moment earth firstbecame habitable is it really reasonable to imagine that evolution turned anunliving chemical soup into the first true living cells in that geologicaleyeblink well maybe but it's also possible thatlife on Earth didn't start on earth at all perhaps it started on a distantworld somewhere in the Milky Way and somehow survived a long journey throughthe void to colonize the early Earth the plausibility of panspermia comes down towhether or not any living organism can survive it's three deadly stagesejection from an origin world traveled to the new world the entry to thatworld's biosphere let's start with the exciting parts the beginning and the endof the journey one way for a budding microbial astronaut to travel the Starsis via Luther panspermia basically be attached to a rock that travels betweenplanets now we know that debris from planetary surfaces can be ejected intospace during asteroid or comet impacts hundreds of meteorites have been foundon earth that have compositions suggesting they originated from the Moonor Mars many chunks of Earth have also been ejected into space most of themfrom the largest impacts like the one that killed the dinosaurs some of thatdebris would have contained life but could hitchhiking microbes have survivedthat ejection to escape Earth's gravitational field a chunk of impactdebris has to bekicked to a minimum of eleven point two kilometers per second that's the escapevelocity at Earth's surface that requires an acceleration of up tohundreds of thousands of GS and hundreds of thousands of Earth atmospheres inshock pressure similar forces apply when it smacks down at the other end of thejourney temperatures in these rocks can rise to several hundred Kelvin in theimpacts and during reentry that all sounds pretty unsurvivable butscientists have engaged in various forms of microbe abuse to test this thisincludes shooting high velocity projectiles loaded with coloniesspitting them up in an ultracentrifuge attempting to splat colonies withextreme pressure in back plates and if that's not realistic enough microbelaced rocks have been dropped from space strapped to the outside of reentryvehicles many life forms have been tested from corn bacteria that you findeverywhere in the soil to primitive cyanobacteria to heat resistantextremophiles and even fungus spores and lichens while survival rates may be lowat least a small fraction of bugs of any of these types can survive the pummelingof high pressure acceleration exposure to extreme temperature for example inatmospheric reentry is more problematic some extremophiles can survive attemperatures above a hundred Celsius but the surfaces of rocks during impact orreentry will be much much hotter than this and this is where we identify ourfirst microbial contender for panspermia endoliths these are organisms that livedeep within rocks deep enough that they're protected from the extremes oftemperature change as we'll see endoliths are exceptional candidates asmicro cosmonauts for a number of reasons they may also be the only critters thatcan actually survive the journey between planets but before we talk about thehazards of that journey let's look at a gentler mechanism for getting life intospace a wide variety of living single celled organisms are foundfloating around in the atmosphere as high as the stratosphere some of thismaterial may make it into space just this year Russian cosmonautsreported the discovery of familiar bacterial DNA on the outer surface ofthe International Space Station they suggested rowed electrical currents fromthe atmosphere below or it came from space probably the former though theselevitating microbes have a gentler journey up and they may also have afaster trip to their destination very small individual bacteria can beaccelerated by their star's own radiation and be ejected from the solarsystem this is Radio panspermia stars may be constantly spraying theirgermy life through the galaxies in some respects it sounds like levitating intospace and becoming your own solar sail is way more efficient than Luthorpanspermia except for one thing the viciousenvironment of space probably annihilates all microbes notsurrounded by a nice big spaceship made of rock getting up and down again fromspace is the fun part but for a budding panspermia life form the journey itselfyou simultaneously the most boring and the most lethal our pilgrim microbeshave to contend with near absolute zero temperatures extreme drynessa hard vacuum and probably worst of all some incredibly destructive radiationfor up to millions of years so can they do it the best way to simulate theconditions of space travel is to send things to space the first experiment wasway back in 1936 when fungal spores were sent on a stratospheric balloon ridesince then every potential Pants permeating life form has taken rides onvarious satellites most notably the International Space Station it's mostlysingle celled organisms and spores but also tardigrades and nematodes some ofthese tests were actually to test survivability on Mars but the resultsTrane's and in some the results are clear manybugs can survive the vacuum freezing cold microgravity and absolute drynessof space but radiation is a problem we'll come back to that when protectedfrom radiation various bacteria fungi lichens archaea and viruses have beenrevived after months of exposure to the cold dry microgravity of the vacuum insome cases it's after six years even the tardigrade everyone's favorite extremelyphilic multicellular teddy bear can revive after exposure to spacethe key is cryptobiosis many life forms can enter or produce a hibernating formthat's incredibly resistant to adverse conditions in particular life forms thatcould survive extreme dryness and hydro biotic life forms do especially wellthat includes certain reproductive spores especially of fungi but alsocritters can enter an N hydro biotic state they dry out shrivel up and waitout the bad conditions tardigrades are an amazing example ofthis but the real champions are endospores this is a hibernation statethat many bacteria enter when deprived of the needful conditions for life theygenerate a protective wall shrink down stabilize their DNA and essentially shutoff all metabolism they don't need water air or nutrients and are remarkablyresistant to radiation damage or DNA decay bacterial endospores have beenrejuvenated after up to six years exposure to the cold and vacuum of spacethere are reports of viable endospores found on earth and dated to millions ofyears perhaps even a couple of hundred million years plenty long enough to makean interstellar journey the real challenge is radiation solar ultravioletradiation in space can reach a hundred million times the UV intensity of sealevel this will typically completely destroy any unprotected microbe in afraction a second DNA molecular machinery andcell walls are shredded by ultraviolet light tardigrades and bacterial sporesare somewhat resistant the latter if they are in layered coloniesphotosynthetic cells like cyanobacteria and lichens can also survive directsunlight in low Earth orbit briefly mortality is still high in all of theselike and seem to do the best with cell surviving up to several months ofexposure but probably not for years a star's intense UV radiation probablyrules out radio panspermia only the tiniest microbes probably bacterialspores are light enough to be accelerated by a star's light and thosethings are likely destroyed before they can get far enough from their home staranyway even far from the intense UV radiation of a star interstellar spaceis thick with energetic cosmic rays near light speed atomic nuclei as well asx rays and gamma rays endospores are somewhat resistant to cosmic rays butthere is a limit the only true protection is a thick wall of solidmaterial once again we're back to impact ejecta and litho panspermia microbesburied deep enough in rock are entirely safe from UV and safe from cosmic raysif deep enough endoliths natural rock dwelling organisms have representativesin all domains of The Tree of Life they are often extremophiles and theirresilience often translates to the conditions of space they also haveexceptionally low metabolisms with some having reproduction rates of decades tocenturies or perhaps even millions of years there are endo lytic bacteriaviruses and fungi dug out from deep beneath the ocean floor that appear tobe a couple hundred million years old if anything can travel between the starsit's these guys okay to review many microbial life forms can survive thejourney into and out of space endoliths can survive long space journeys buriedin rock can they really make it to anotherplanet and is it ever likely to happen I mean statistically let's start with theeasy journey within a solar system like Mars to earth the minimum travel timefor a Martian impact ejector to get to earth is something like six monthsalthough it's more likely to take years or centuries given the random nature ofthe journey those timescales are totally reasonablefor the more hearty earth microbes traveling between solar systems is awhole different game first the rock has to escape not just from the planetsgravitational field but its stars field also to get a microbe from the surfaceof the earth to interstellar space requires a large velocity around fourtimes what is needed to just escape the earth that rock would endure acommensurately higher acceleration to attain that speed with all the pressureand temperature pain that went with it once an infested Rock makes it out ofthe solar system it has a very long very boring journey ahead to get to thenearest stars a rock traveling at the sun's galactic orbital speed of 30 km/swould take several tens of thousands of years but real panspermia expeditionslikely take much longer there's only a tiny chance that an interstellar rockwill be caught in the gravitational field of any given star that it passestake uma or more for example the asteroid that zipped through our solarsystem in 2017 it's going to escape our solar system and this was probably theclosest encounter it had for hundreds of millions of years some life forms may beable to hibernate that long but at this point the issue is just frequency ofimpacts is it at all likely that a microbe bearing rock from another starsystem hit the earth in the short time it took life to take hold well itdepends on the abundance of life in the galaxy but it seems dubious oneinteresting alternative possibility is that life bearing rocks aren't so oftencaptured by planetary systems but rather by the giant deceivedand gas that precede the formation of planets circled protoplanetary disksthese could act like gigantic nets to capture break apart and disperse theseeds of life before a solar system even forms star fairy microbes could thenremain in hibernation into a planets coalesce from the protoplanetary diskand one of these life bearing rocks slams into a newly habitable worldperhaps the most convincing argument against panspermia is that if thedormant seeds of life are so common throughout the galaxy why haven't manyof the forty billion earth like planets produced technological civilizations farin advance of us and speaking of aliens a fun version of this idea is directedpanspermia in which the seeds of life are sent out deliberately to engineerlife across the galaxy they would actually be pretty easy for a moderatelyadvanced civilization but aliens aside panspermia is a plausible but by nomeans accepted explanation for the origin of life on Earth if it's truethen you me and everyone you know is an alien a genetic immigrant from anotherworld perhaps with many cousins scatteredacross the galactic reaches of space time before we get to comments I am verypleased to announce today's episode is brought to you by our brand newspace time merch store we have all new nerd tastic t shirts mugs hats postersand even a baby onesie we'll be updating the store with even more merchantscoming weeks so make sure you check out PBS space time comm in the last episodewe talked about the interstellar space rock boom or more and the proposition bysome astronomers that it may be an alien light sail I laid out the case why thisis very unlikely and I asked you guys what you thought about the out waitedattention the media gives to these sorts of Fringe ideas regardless of theirconnection to reality is it harmful or is any public exposure to science goodit seems that you did think about it and quite hard justin o'brien places theresponsibility on the media stating the problem is therampant lack of journalistic integrity that problem exists wherever ajournalist is looking for fame and its trappings and when a media is slave toadvertiser demands well this is definitely a factor when both the mediaoutlet and the writer live or die by that month's clicks it's easier to losesight of old fashioned journalism or to make the necessary sacrifices to pay therent hmm hard to say whose fault that isadvertisers editors journalists mindless market forces or the viewer forinsisting on free content which brings us back to advertisers guest who puts itwell and I quote when the media says Harvard scientist says X this isreceived effectively as a pronouncement of truth from scientists when it isinevitably proven false or the predicted thing doesn't eventuate the publicnaturally learns not to trust in science as a whole even casting doubt on allestablished science as well Ian Oksana made similar points also adding thatit's harmful of scientists or communicators do not qualify theirfringe ideas with notes of caution otherwise it gives the public adistorted view of how science works and a related point Steve Zara says thatexaggerations and hype are harmful because they encourage excitement aboutthe wrong things Sam Winfield agrees saying that hypeover nothing leads directly to disinterest they are crying wolf allgood points if the press only emphasizes the most outlandish interpretations dowe eventually get bored by the real universe give kids too much candy andthey won't eat their vegetables in this case umemura is totally amazing as ourfirst natural interstellar visitor and the glory belongs to those whodiscovered and unlocked its real properties seems a bit cheap for someoneto come swooping in and shout aliens every time something inexplicable isobserved and we have at least one counterpoint mark gibble says that noit's probably not harmful at least in this case as long as we have people tobring rationality to the dreamers and the skeptics alike it's a proud Duty wehave here at PBS space time squashing dreams and killing the buzz since 2015heartbreak one changes the subject pointing out that if aliens were to landon PBS studios we would do a lot of biological testing and determine thatmost probably it isn't aliens wait are you disparaging our ability tobiologically test aliens or are you saying we'd lie about it if we found outthat there were aliens I assure you I will be the first on the alien bandwagonand when the evidence is clear so you know how to be sure Italians no funbuzzkill skeptics like us will be saying it too although a few of you point outthat denying that the murmur is aliens is just what aliens would say, or go we arealiens well to deny that would make me even more of an alien so I guess you gotme
