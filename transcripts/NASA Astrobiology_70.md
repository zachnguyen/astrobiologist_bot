[Music] a [Music] [Applause] [Music] greetings friends fellow earthlings artistic creators and dreamers of dreams and welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life as usual we are brought to you by Sean net.org and the NASA astrobiology program and I'm honored to be here as your host I'm Dr Graham laau also known online as the cosmobiology before we jump into this month's episode we want to give a shout out like we usually do to all of you out there one who are watching live right now or watching our recording later on but also to those of you who share about our Show online on social media and websites to your friends and family maybe you call up your friend at night and tell them hey check out ask an astrobiologist they have awesome people on this month we want to give a huge shout out to Katarina Erikson and her profile online on social media of Marka design Katarina is an artist who makes Incredible designs for a lot of different organizations and does commissions she also years ago was commissioned to create the logo for seanet and I love that logo so much that I had it tattooed on my body permanently it's an incredible design and so a huge thanks to Katarina for sharing about this month's episode in particular and all the awesome work that you do uh using art to share about space and exploration and science um now today's episode is a special just in time for the astrobiology science conference or abson that's happening next week in Rhode Island uh this is the biggest astrobiology focused conference in the world it happens every two years it brings together folks who are sharing about science and research communication and education philosophy art and more in the realm of astrobiology and next week something very special was happening for the NASA astrobiology program we are releasing the next issue of the astrobiology graphic history series which is issue number n9ine now for those of you watching right now we're going to drop a link in the chat on YouTube so you can go check out this issue of this graphic history series the comic books right now um and you can have a look at them also next week we're going to have print editions uh starting to be available of this comic so joining us today for ask asobo is the artist and scientist who's responsible for creating the graphic history series Dr Aaron grall Dr grall began his career at Nasa as a geom microbiologist and is now engaging in science communication for astrobiology as a writer for the NASA astrobiology website as well as his work as being a graphic artist and so Dr grall welcome to ask an astrobiologist and thank you for joining us oh thank you thank you for having me back again yeah so so back again that's a that's an important thing here you are our first guest that we've asked to come back for an episode and I was looking back you were on the show back in 2019 for episode 26 um obviously a lot has changed since then we had you on originally to talk about the astrobiology graphic history series um at that time we had issue number seven and NASA astrobiology on the YouTube channel was releasing a short video about the process that you go through for creating this this wonderful artwork through a comic format and now we're at we're at Issue Number Nine um and I'd love if you don't mind uh just to get things started if you can share a synopsis of issue number nine for us this this new uh graphic history novel it's being released I'm sure and I think like one of the one of the reasons we're kind of this is a big deal is that issue 9 is probably one of the most important ones we've done so far because it addresses one of the biggest questions that we get as the astrobiology program and that is how do I become an astrobiologist so this this issue kind of dives into to what you should study you know what what are the motivations behind science and and curiosity and asking questions and how does that work and you know if you're thinking about going into astrobiology as a career what paths are available to take like to get involved in the astrobiology community yeah absolutely I you know for ask an astrobiologist one of the PO purposes of this show itself is to help answer that question how do I become an astrobiologist how do I ask questions of those in the field about their work and so it is a crucial thing for me personally I probably answer at least a thousand if not more than a thousand emails and messages on social media every year um from Young students from around the world who want to be involved in astrobiology and they have questions and oftentimes pointing them towards the NASA astrobiology website and the graphic history series is part of what I share as well as telling them to join in for our show um but there's a lot of things that people who want to be involved especially in the science side of astrobiology need to know and so I'd love to jump into a few things from this issue itself uh specifically uh jumping to page four right away uh in this issue uh this entire page kind of showcases you yourself the Artist as a character in the comic book um going through the process of science the scientific process and I understand from our previous conversation this actually comes from your own actual research um I wonder if you can explain what it was like for you to draw yourself for one thing uh and also to to to kind of revisit your previous research and sharing that in in the comic I mean yeah it was it was it was kind of fun to dry myself also kind of nerve wracking I mean um I guess the easiest thing at like you know as an artist you're never kind of perfectly happy with what you draw so like it's e it's easier to be unhappy with my image of myself than it is with other people I feel a little less self conscious about asking myself permission to to post a picture of myself but uh um I guess the reason I kind of ended up on this page was uh this this was this page was diving into the scientific process and how that works on a very basic kind of level so the easiest thing to talk about in terms of experiments was something I'd done myself and um it goes into research that I was involved in uh with with NASA NASA as and Chris McKay at Nasa as in the atakama desert looking at how to identify microbes in soils in the atakama that are extremely dry um ex and experience UV radiation and that sort of thing so um yeah it was I think it was just kind of easier to discuss something I was very familiar with uh in terms of like looking at the basic kind of process behind the scientific process it's very cool yeah I mean for myself you know we all you all suffer through Nostalgia or find the joy of nostalgia when we look back into the past um looking back even to your previous episode on episode 26 of our show I had to rewatch it to to understand what we talked about before and saw myself five years ago and I saw you five years ago and it's kind of interesting looking back um did you have any any kind of sensations of nostalgia and feeling like a certain connection when you were creating uh this page of the comic book in particular where you're you're drawing yourself in in the role that you had some time in the past oh for sure I mean I think I think that was probably the first project where I was really in the field you know sleeping a tent every night and and kind of out in the middle of the desert working with other scientists um collecting samples and doing analysis and stuff and so yeah there was I brought up a lot of memories of of what that experience was like and kind of the the excitement of being early on in my career and and being able to go out and kind of do those things in the field and have have my first experience of that sort of Adventure of of exploring science in the natural environment um that I'd sort of dreamed as was as since I was a little kid yeah that's fantastic um now you know like the comic itself jumps kind of quickly then into some of the different you know larger scientific disciplines that are part of this larger realm of astrobiology of of understanding life um of course you know there's a lot of different sciences and and disciplines Beyond science that we'll discuss in a moment that come into astrobiology but specifically uh early on you have some two page kind of spreads really highlighting some of the larger Fields like biology and chemistry geology astronomy uh so we we put a poll out on our YouTube channel just asking everyone what maybe their favorite of these big four might be or or asking them to suggest other fields they find to be their favorite in astrobiology and to share the results of the poll um it was a little little staggering about 51% of respondents said biology was their favorite uh and 34% astronomy and I was a little heartbroken since I have degrees in chemistry and and geology uh chemistry and geology both got ranked pretty low at 8% each um you know and so I I do think you know it's important for us to remember that you know all these disciplines come together to make astrobiology and I guess primarily for you then what was the the the impetus and the thinking behind selecting these four disciplines and then also doing two page spreads for each of them well I mean first of all like I studied biology so yay we won no but I think I think it's important like when you think of astrobiology there's so many disciplines involved um and it's my kind of thought was like go back to to early in education where you're you know maybe in high school where you have biology chemistry you know some of these things if you're if you're somebody that's in middle school high school starting to think about a career like what is what's most important to pay attention to in class what what what shouldn't you sleep through and that sort of thing as we all did when we were in high school every once in a while but um so biology was kind of jumped out and chemistry and and those were just kind of the broadest things we could kind of think of as big things that you need to focus on just if or or you can focus on if you want to become an astrobiologist and then further down you get into kind of the Specialties that fall within those those disciplines yeah that's fantastic and I should mention for our audience for those who don't know yet um in the RM of astrobiology one of the most remarkable documents and one that has been helpful for those who have the question of how do I become an astrobiologist has been the astrobiology primer um version one originally was a rather short document um created to kind of explain astronomy and geology and biology and these different Realms the the general language of each of these Realms and how they apply to the search for life and understanding life and now we're at version three of the astrobiology primer has just been released um it's an incredible large number of documents put together by a a very large array of scientists early career researchers writing about topics like astronomy geology biology so for those who have this question of how do I become an astrobiologist the primer is one way to start learning some of that language and and learning about this but also now we have issue number nine of the graphic history series and so Aaron for you so I will say also have a degree in biology I do love biology very much it was one of my my very first alluring draws towards science and so you start off your your first two page spread is biology and I have to say you know as a consumer of beautiful art but also someone who's super into the science you kind of have a really fun you know kind of jux position of really good science but also kind of taking some liberties with the art and placement the coloration of things and the biology spread you know from Hot Springs to halophilic organisms and all this stuff going on how do you personally choose how to frame the science but also be a little bit more at Liberty with the art to make sure it's aesthetically pleasing for the audience oh that's a tricky question yeah I kind of thought of these when you're thinking about biology as a discipline there's so many things involved from ecology to biochemistry to you know molecular biology and developmental biology so there's all these kind of subdisciplines and and capturing that representing all of those things in one image that falls under biologies was kind of tricky and so I kind of did a collage of different elements and yeah I've got you know cells blown up and things in miniature things like you know you got a giant amoeba floating in the sky and that kind of thing so um just trying to capture that sense that you know if you open a biology textbook biology 101 you're going to cover so many different things about life on Earth and it can be a whole jumble of things and like there's going to be one thing maybe or two things that really catch your attention to focus on and that's kind of when you focus down into these more you know the disciplines like molecular biology or something like if you're really interested in in DNA and how how cells work on a molecular level you know so yeah trying to kind of C capture that and capture the movement of all that and in one image was was sort of the goal yeah that's very awesome um and kind of in that note too of like how to capture these things and how to bring them up together um I'm kind of curious so in the next two page spread of chemistry um you know it's really incredible you you showcase you know some of the scientists and the research they're doing through NASA and and things like that but I also noticed especially in the chemistry spread um there's several different molecules and there are some chemical reactions written out and so I'm curious for you for for you know the past issues especially uh since this issue was just released have you found that this is kind of a conversation starter when you include certain molecules and chemical reactions that when you go and you share these comics with other people that it kind of engages them in in a question of like why that molecule or why that chemical reaction um has it has it been a way for you to engage with the audiences about why you've made those choices yeah absolutely and and and the same with including specific scientists everything that is included in the the graphic histories is real it's real astrobiology you know these are reactions that scientists study now and and you know you can go to the references and look at papers on on weathering reactions and stuff like the the reaction where the water's kind of pouring into the ocean and all these chemical are kind of pouring with it um and all these are are are actual reactions that are kind of vital to astrobiology research so we kind of tried to pick some that that highlight things and also lead readers on a path path down other research if you know you can go down the rabbit hole about photosynthesis and learn about what that means for astrobiology research on Earth or on exoplanets or you know bio signature DET detection and and EXO atmospheres and that sort of thing so I try to include a lot of little elements and little kind of you know things within the pictures that that can lead people on those on those down those little rabbit holes of knowledge that's very fun and I should mention for our audience uh who are watching live or those tuning in uh later for the recording um there are a lot of fun little Easter eggs from the NASA astrobiology program inside of this issue in particular and so it's kind of worth exploring this one uh and just seeing if you can find some of those things maybe reach out to us reach out to Aaron or myself um and just let us know if you found something you think might be one of those fun little tidbits from the program um now Erin I'm glad that you mentioned the real scientists you know there are real researchers who are funded through NASA or or employees of NASA throughout this issue um doing the work of astrobiology um now I do want to say that that it touched my heart especially you have Andrew poar in there uh both you and I in the past have worked with Andrew uh Andrew recently passed away and so it's it's really beautiful to have um aamus uh character as well for someone who was so impactful in the community in this issue and so I'm I'm very thankful to you for that for honoring him in that way um but it's also really cool just to see all these different researchers and kind of the work they do do you have to reach out to each of them like individually and ask their permission and then like run drafts by them or do you like create it and then just like send it and say hey I'm making you for my comic book like how's that go um I I kind of give people a warning I and then usually like I need to to get permission both for using their likeness and for the words that they're saying in the comic and so yeah I I reach out to everybody and usually it's it's kind of later in the process when I have enough of a a sketch of them that I feel comfortable with with the likeness myself and then make sure that they're comfortable with the likeness and and and all of that and it's it's always interesting going back and forth with the scientists because some some people don't you know they're not too fussed about what they look like they're just they but they're happy to be included and other people are you know like I want to be a superhero I want can I be flying through the sky kind of thing like you know like that um and also working with the words is the is the hardest part and that's I mean that's the thing with comics where you know the the you have the imagery and you have the words as two kind of separate things to tell the story so you're telling a one story in two tracks alongside each other and that works really well for Education because some people are visual Learners some people aren't you know and and it it helps kind of attach ideas to imagery and to words and whatever works best for you is kind of there on the page but you don't have a lot of room for the words you know you don't have a lot of room for the images and you don't want them both to just be saying the same thing like that one of the classic kind of examples in in creating Comics is you don't want to have somebody punching somebody and then the word saying and then he punched that person you know that it defeats the purpose of having the picture there in the first place so yeah going back and forth with the scientists some of whom are super comic literate and have read a lot of comic books growing up and they understand you know it's really easy for them um some scientists I've never read a comic book so they don't really and and you don't really realize when you've been reading them as a kid how much how much learning there is in kind of learning the language of how a comic works and so having to go back and forth with people and say like no like you can't you know we don't have a whole page to say this we only have two sentences so how do we say this in two sentences correctly you know that's that's always tricky yeah that sounds crucial I mean in science we have to learn how to concisely convey our information at scientific meetings and conferences and journal articles how to abbreviate the very long lecture that many of us scientists want to give and bring it down and so it must be then then a bit of a challenge for you as an artist then pair that down even more to make it something that works inside of a comic book yeah and and try to figure out how to let the picture say the rest of it because in science it's also important that we know how to communicate every exact detail so when we write scientific papers and things the purpose is that somebody can read that paper and recreate the experiment in exact detail and recreate the results so you know I think a lot of like it it's very difficult to go from that that high level of detail down to very concise sentences but keep the detail use the imagery to help try and keep that detail that's Fant I do have to ask for my own edification do you do you keep track of like your first draft your second draft like your earlier Renditions as you're going through the process of of working down to the final language and and the final imagery I do yeah because I I I tend to like you know like it's all written kind of as a script first in pure text and that's always way too long when you start actually mapping that out as imagery and then it kind of goes from that very very rough sketches um I start building those into because I do every all the artwork by hand up until um coloring so once everything is drawn in pencil and then it's Inked and then that's scanned in and then I start doing the coloring and then everything's kind of laid out with the text you know on the computer but I start putting those kind of very rough sketches into into there and laying at the text side by side as I work so that I know you know how the text has to be adjusted how the image has to be redrawn in a way so the text fits and and that sort of thing and then you know each of those kind of iterations I I save as a a draft PDF and those go to the editor and we kind of go back and forth on on how to you know get it right and then those go to the scientists and then it just keeps you know you keep whittling down to the to the final product very cool so maybe in the future we'll have like a cre cut of like the back scenes of the development of one of these issues um I would personally love to see that now I I will jump to the next spread that you have in the in the comic uh focuses on one of my favorite Fields because my PhD is in geology um is geology itself you know and I'm kind of bummed that that so few of our voters in our poll thought geology was their favorite I guess we had a a large bias towards biology and astronomy but you know geology is so important for our understanding of Life as a planetary process life doesn't happen you know just on a planet it happens to a planet and life and our Earth have co evolved through time and if there are alien biospheres out there certainly understanding geology and geochemistry and geophysics and processes of how a life and a world uh interact and co evolve together is so crucial and one thing I really love in your spread I I love that you have you know a few little things you have like biffs these banded iron formations you have some work going on in glaciers and volcanoes you show planetary Interiors you have some Mars uh geology going on there and more and so I'm wondering for you Dr gronstal what is your favorite geological feature to draw and why I think I think did like I found out in this this uh issue it's the the banded iron formations like looking at those and kind of looking at like just the coloring and everything and figuring out how to make the coloring work and like that was that was actually kind of fun um drawing the lava field was or the lava flow was actually pretty fun too and trying to figure out how to get the glowing right and you know like and that's always kind of just fun with all the motion and the the the adventure of it you know very cool is there is there anything in particular that you think is really difficult to communicate in an artistic sense like this through a comic book about geology in particular or or anything about you know planetary structures oh H yeah I mean I think it I maybe maybe just kind of the historical aspect of it I mean geology is such an important terms of study in the sense that it's almost like a book that you can open and and read back through through history of a planet you know you can look at 100 years ago you can look at a thousand years ago you can look at a billion years ago like by looking back through geology and kind of capturing that sense of time is is tough I think yeah that makes a lot of sense I me know our time sense is very much related to how we evolved on the planet Earth you know we understand very short periods of time relevant to us but an atosc I mean a human mind really can't fathom that uh and then billions of years it's really hard to us for us to imagine even those of us who are trained in geology and astronomy in these Realms where we do contemplate large numbers it's still kind of beyond our own our own time thinking um which is also relevant to the next spread that you have which is astronomy um one thing I really love in the astronomy section I mean you include real data in there from the James web Space Telescope you have real data from a ground based Observatory um I also love that you have so many different observatories and telescopes there you have the very large array as a radio telescope you have different groundbased uh telescopes but also space based telescopes um I'm wondering how you selected those if there's if there's anything more you would have wanted to add or um if you would personally want to see something developed in the future because you want to create it as an artist um oh that's a good question I mean like the the Tes opes were selected I mean it's important to show that you know telescopes are are designed and built with kind of specific observations in mind so some telescopes look at radio signals some look you know at different Spectra um to to gather information so it's it's important to show like a a wide AR range a wide array of those telescopes um there are you know ones on Earth that astronomers can actually go and physically be at and and do their research at and you know there's there's even like a a home telescope on that page where you know at home you can look through and and observe things in the sky so like to show that kind of range of how you can work with telescopes but also the range of telescopes that exist and what they observe um is important and I mean and for future stuff I mean I want I want something that can take a photograph of the surface of an exoplanet some giant thing that you know we don't have the capability capability of building yet but something that can that can get us you know looking in detail at planets around other Suns or other stars absolutely um now I will say you know it's not just these big four you know kind of larger disciplines um there's lots of other subdisciplines lots of other disciplines in The Sciences engineering sociology psychology philosophy history art music culture there's so much that comes into this realm of understanding who and what we are here and now in the past in the future here on Earth and so you kind of explore this in the next several pages of this issue you um some of these other disciplines I wonder what your favorite other discipline or favorite other realm of thought was to create and to draw for this comic oh man um I mean I like like for me I love oceanography I'm a water person so that was kind of one of the things I almost almost kind of went into studying well I just can't get enough of it so I I mean in terms of disciplines that that was something that really interested me but then I think also just going into art obviously and how how you you know the disciplines that are involved in kind of communicating and representing science which is as important as doing the science itself I mean especially at Nasa where we have a responsibility to to communicate what we learn to the public um it's it's super important to to understand you know when you get a Spectra back from from James web like what is the best way to show people that and how do you how how do you represent that data in a way that that you understand and that other people can understand so that you know we we learn as much as we can from the from the data that we're get we're Gathering uh so I think those those kind of side disciplines you wouldn't think of that are involved in the astrobiology community involved in and getting the most from our science are are a really interesting aspect yeah absolutely I'm glad you mentioned oceanography I also loved marine biology and oceanography when I was younger I did an internship at The Graduate School of oceanography working on Marine molecular biology uh just yesterday I was talking to a student in the UK who is interested in being involved in astrobiology for a PhD program and was curious uh you know like how many how much of the field of astrobiology includes people doing work on like ocean worlds and and you know deep sea stuff and things like that I'm like you know actually a very large amount um you know we have the network for ocean worlds uh the flow program for Future Leaders of ocean worlds for early career researchers there's a lot of people coming to astrobiology even if we go into different realms like you know geochemistry and biology and stuff like that who are still very much interested in ocean life many of us are scuba divers many of us have been Sailors have been Surfers have spent our time around oceans because the ocean has inspired us to think about what's possible there's a lot of of missions in development that are you know being planned for for Missions to Ocean worlds like the moons of of Saturn and Jupiter and things that you know there's there's a lot of opportunity for oceanographers to Ocean Sciences to be involved in in N research yeah absolutely you know I have to have to have some master biologists on to ask them about Europa Clipper and dragonfly and some of the other missions and the the hopeful upcoming orbe Lander for Enceladus um because there are so many cool missions going on to Ocean worlds um currently in our solar system and maybe sometime in the not too too distant future other star systems as well um now I do want to point out in page 17 of the comic is one that kind of touched my own heart a little bit for two different reasons um One is because you included the career path suggestions um which is is on the NASA astrobiology website so astrobiology nasa.gov um you can find the career path suggestions uh under the career section um which you know I always share that through YouTube and social media and website questions and email um for those who want to know like what paths do most astrobiologists follow to get there um I also do want to say a huge thank you uh for including our producer and director Mike toon um in that in that Comics you have a version of him there and you give a shout out to ask an astrobiologist and so it's nice uh to see us there um and I'm I'm really glad though that you included now a Comic version of the career path suggestions given that we've shared it so much um and so I kind of want to know from your end how much this this web page has meant to you being it's been around for a while now we've shared it so much and your thought process on how to highlight some of the the specific things you wanted to see on this page in particular yeah I mean I think I think it was and this was a a infographic developed by Jenny moderate at NASA headquarters who who also does like the the calendars and the Earth Bas stuff for for NASA you know she's now now a civil servant at headquarters and also features on page 18 kind of holding it up in the bottom a little shout out to her because she's worked with the astrobiology program for for years and years when back you know as as her kind of career has developed at Nasa but I think it's really important to tie all these resarch resources that we have together you know that's that's been a an infographic that's been really important um for for outreach and for helping explain to kind of early career people the process of becoming an astrobiologist and like I think it was really important to tie that into the comic and and and for the comic to tie back to the resources that we already have available um but to to show it kind of in a new way with some new information and so I I thre some you know I had people kind of explaining uh more specifically kind of processes along that of like things like Astron Asen astrobiologist to look at yeah very cool um like I said I I love that page glad you have that and in the several pages that follow then you you include a lot of things the NASA astrobiology program has LED or been involved with including abson ABG gradon uh the past Fame lab that we had some years ago uh workshops that NASA astrobiology has sponsored there's so much from the NASA astrobiology program in this issue and so I highly you know suggest to the audience to read the issue you're G to love it come to abyon if if you're coming um you can get a print copy there but also check it out online um but I wonder from you Dr grall is there anything that really didn't work for you in the development of this issue or maybe something that you kind of like just wasn't really coming together scientifically artistically for you that you kind of had to abandon maybe that you would have wanted to see otherwise um yeah I mean initially I was kind of hoping to to single out specific stories of people and and their path toward becoming an astrobiologist to maybe do kind of like little half page kind of short stories within within the comic so that were some specific examples of how you know you go from just being curious as a as a child to becoming part of the astrobiology community and I started started down that road but it's just there's too much there's there's too many different stories there's too many different paths that people have followed um and it it was it was too hard to kind of like the the book would have been 200 pages long if I tried to do that and it would have taken 10 years to make so um yeah we had to kind of kind of limit that part of the storytelling I think that I think that's the most most the biggest change in terms of of of the outline of the story that that before before we get to the final product yeah absolutely I feel the same way when I have an episode of ask an astrobiologist I feel like I could talk to you all day about every single page and every single thing in this comic um that's why it was important for us I mean that was why it was important for us to point to like ask an astrobiologist because you do that you know when you talk to people they talk about their story and how they how they got interested and and became involved in astrobiology so there's other sources out there that cover that I guess yeah there's a lot to explore you know and those of us who are involved in the field of astrobiology our own backgrounds our interest as well as the work that we've done um across this realm of understanding life now I do want to jump a little bit here um one thing I also I love the very last image it's a picture of Earth and three different visions of Earth and you mentioned kind of the larger International the global astrobiology audience those who are enthusiastic about astrobiology those who are early career researchers and scientists and astrobiology those who are working in the field from around the world there are lots of ways to be involved um it's not just going through NASA and the things that many of us here in the US work on it really is an international human endeavor um and I love that this issue is going to be translated into Spanish on the NASA astrobiology website there are previous issues that have been translated to Korean and Japanese as well and it's always kind of you know it's it's beautiful to see how much astrobiology brings together people from around the world I constantly answer questions from Young students early career researchers from just about every country imaginable across this planet um Katherine Herrera who was a past student of mine at Blue Marble space Institute of science um and was part of the AMD University astrobiology course some years ago uh they had almost F almost 500 students taking part in this introductory astrobiology course and she created a really beautiful graphic that had the word astrobiology written in 36 different languages representing all the languages of those who are taking part in that class at that one point in time um and so you know I'm really glad that you kind of included this vision for how people around the world can be involved um I'm wondering kind of you know from your perspective what do you think is the biggest takeaway or or what is your biggest hope that you know anyone tuning in from any country around the world who reads this issue of this comic how do you what's your biggest hope for how it might Inspire them or or help them in their own learning I think one of like there there's some really key points to this this issue and this discussion of how to become an astrobiologist we get that question so much and I think it's there's a lot of people that that just want to work for NASA and they have this dream of of working in space and astrobiology has such um interesting and important questions in it that that's kind of what what a lot of people will focus on is like okay that's how I want to do this um and the first kind of main point is that astrobiology like biology won your poll um astrobiology is much more than AST than biology itself in fact biology is only a small portion of astrobiology you have geology you have astronomy you have all these other things that people study and so biology is not the only way into astrobiology as a discipline or a field and it's really important to to to know that and to find what actually interests you and and actually Sparks that interest and those that Curiosity and those questions in you and and find the field that aligns with that um and the second point is that not all biology at NASA is astrobiology so there's space biology there's planetary protection there's you know a lot of earth science and and kind of um ecology research at Nasa in different departments so if if it is biology that you're super interested in astrobiology is not the only place to look that's actually kind of a small fraction of the biology that's done at Nasa and then the other thing is that most astrobiologist astrobiologists don't work at NASA or a Space Program they work in universities or research institutions and a lot of them they maybe their their research is funded by NASA or Isa or some other space you know some other space program in another country but they're not actually B they're not actually scientists at those those those institutions they're they're you know at universities and things and the other point is that that NASA you know NASA's the US space agency there's there space agencies all over the world in other countries um there's astrobiologists working at universities and pretty any country um there's there's astrobiology societies that exist in other countries so um don't limit don't limit yourself to to you know just biology or just NASA or anything make make sure you you connect with the scientist in your region in your in your home countries and um read their papers find what find find people that are doing things that really interest you and talk to them scientists love to talk about their work and you'll be surprised if you reach out to people the kind of responses you'll get and and and yeah that's that's kind of the the first starting point getting into astrobiology is it's just read about scientists doing cool stuff that really interest you and and send them an email I love that so much and I'll say for myself myself and several other astrobiologists were honored by being included in as Cameo characters in another comic book called astrobiology number one from Space Walk Comics um it was really humbling to be a character in a comic book I imagine everyone you've included must feel really awesome about that I know in the last episode we had on in episode 26 you mentioned that one thing you love to do is go around and have those who are in the comic book sign your own personal copy which I I find really awesome but I have to ask then for anyone in our audience watching right now who wants to be immortalized as a comic book character um one is do you take commissions um for your artwork um or are you interested in the future in possibly collaborating with other people and kind of developing other Comics as well oh for sure I mean I do I do kind of you know I do a lot of comics on the side and when I have time and that sort thing I mean it's always it's always a time thing when you're you know you always have lots of projects you're working on in the back burner and stuff but I have done a few commissions and things like that just for for fun but it's not it's not kind of my main focus right now at least yeah I mean yeah there's always so much to do um especially when you're involved in science and writing and art and all these things together and and I love that so much um I think to get to some of our audien's questions that are coming in right now I'm going to move to our next segment of the show uh our faster than light questions um so you can answer in whatever way you feel happy about but these are questions we ask a lot of our guests um just to see the range of different workers in the realm of astrobiology and what everyone kind of thinks about some of these very very interesting questions um and the first one kind of comes to us uh more recently about some of the interesting things going on around our planet from biology and so for you do grall what is your favorite thing that life on Earth does the trick for me is answering these things fast as light CU I'm I like to talk and tell stories but uh you can go a little slower yeah go a little slower so um I think I think that's a tough question but I think my my favorite thing about life on Earth is is the way it survives and functions at scale like I think it's just amazing that you can look down a microscope and and see these microscopic organisms and the way that they start Comm existing as a community and communicating but then those microscopic or organisms can change the the atmospheric composition of our entire planet so the way that you know life kind of exists like it just how how how you think about the scale is how you look at life you know it's you can look at a microb individually or you can look at its effect as a community on the entire planet and I think that's just amazing absolutely yeah it's so cool what life does um and then I'm sure next week at abson we're going to hear about a lot more awesome things that life has been doing lately from a lot of researchers working in that realm um now a lot of us in astrobiology want to know if we communicate with aliens what would we say but our next question kind of comes back to Earth a little bit if you could communicate with any nonhuman organism on Earth what would it be and what would you want to talk about I mean I i' like man there's so many but I I think I'd have to focus on on organisms that you know like you're attached to personally and interact with personally and of course dogs and cats are the first thing that come up comes up because who hasn't sat there and looked at a dog or a cat and they you know they're they're animal companion and thought like what are they thinking or like what what are they trying to tell me um but I think for me it's it's maybe trees like I I feel very attached to trees there's a a a cops of Bur Oak in okaboji Iowa that I've grown up with and and I adore and I would you know I would love to be able to speak with trees in that sense because their the time scale of their life is so much different than ours and I would love to hear stories about my hometown and and things from hundreds of years and those trees were saplings and you know that sort of thing and you have trees that like you know the in California that are thousands of years old and and I think the stories that they could tell would just be amazing and I love storytelling so I'd love to just sit there and listen to them talk absolutely that's a great transition to my next question as well uh you're an artist and a Creator um and a scientist but what stories have inspired you to want to know more about life in the universe oh man I mean I've always wanted to be an explorer to explore an experience adventure and so like camping and camping and reading while camping and everything were a huge part of growing up and I was hugely into fantasy and science fiction and you know things like Star Wars and Star Trek and Voltron where like I think I could recite the Voltron movie word for word as a little kid um but yeah getting into things like you know everything like Ursula Kaya Gwinn uh Norah gemson like some of those authors just I found hugely inspiring Ing and kind of opening up the way you think about the possibility of life um on Earth and Beyond and that sort of thing and then there were you know I got into comics with with X Men and I love stories of of chosen families you know being I think being being gay growing up and and having that experience there were a lot of kind of those emotions and and things growing up that reflected in stories like the X Men and then I got into kind of gu guide deliss and and some of the the comic artist that write histories and write and write that sort of thing so that's kind of how I transition to doing Comics like historical comics and and that and that yeah yeah that's fantastic yeah stories can Inspire us so much um in our lives as researchers as creators and in the ways that we express ourselves in the world and understand who we are um you know through science fiction in in in indeed you know we learn about different ways that the future might unfold for all of us and so there's a lot for us to explore now you've of course had a varied career you know from doing science and writing and creating artwork um and so we're curious if you could go back in time and visit yourself at the start of your career what advice would you give yourself man I mean have fun I think that's you know I don't I don't think I regret like anything like there's not something I else I would have studied I think I mean I love learning and I've always said like if I could if I could just keep going to school and keep doing like learning more and more I would do that and so I don't think i' I'd change anything about my my career path or anything like that i' I'd be nice to like have a Multiverse option where I could have studied all kinds of things at the same time I mean I did a you know degrees in theater and molecular biology at the same time already so I tried to do that but um yeah I think that would be it I think the the big biggest piece of advice would be to uh get started on the next comic right away I tell my I tell myself that every time I finish one um you know get going on it get writing get get you know that kind of thing and of course you know it always comes down to the wire at the end to get it to the printer yeah no kidding I mean I imagine it must be so much work to bring these together so my next question what is something that excites you about the future man I think I think just like looking at all the ideas that that that early career scientists and young people have right now about the future of exploration in space and you know you have some of the idea Labs the astrobiology program has been involved in and and just seeing what possibilities are there for for future exploration things and I think I think just young people in general I think kids these days like when I go and speak to classrooms and stuff are so smart and so clued into things and I don't know sometimes kids get a bad rap these days about spending too much time on screens and you know like all that kind of stuff and I I think that I don't think that's true like I think that um you know I think that kids these days are are are just advancing quick quicker than ever and that like some some people in older Generations don't really recognize that and don't recognize the way that the world is changing and that I have a lot of Hope for for the future or for the future of science yeah it's wonderful and beautiful um now the last question of our faster than light segment is my favorite it's everyone's favorite what is an unbelievable science fact that blows your mind I think I've said before I'm not great with factoids like I'm not I'm not one of those people that has like a Rolodex of of cool things or jokes in my in my head but um so I would have to kind of go back to research that I've been involved with and uh i' I you know I I did deep subsurface microbiology and that I always found fascinating and I always found f fascinating about the idea of just how deep in the earth can you go and still find life and and then you're thinking about as it get hotter and hotter as you approach the Earth's core like when does it get just too hot for metabolism to happen when does stuff just start breaking down and you know it's it's difficult to get underground it's difficult to look for stuff but it's kind of like as deep as we've gone we've still found microorganisms figuring out a way to survive down there and I just think that's incredible yeah there's a very deep biosphere and that's pretty incredible um it also tells us that maybe other worlds out there that have had life happen with them and have evolved through time together might also have deep biospheres and so that's kind of cool um now I will jump to our audience Q&A we've had a few questions come in from the YouTube chat here um we have a couple of questions from uh Twitter SLX as well and so I'll start off with a question from Dr Jim pass who wants to know um from your perspective how space art can be spread more extensively through Society perhaps especially among those in subcultures or various cultures where they might downplay the importance of space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life and so kind of what is your view for how we could spread space art more o i that's a really good question I mean I think it's it's really important to try to reach out beyond beyond people who are already interested in science and interested in space um I think with the the graphic histories we've had a lot of you know University class like science classes at University using them or science museums kind of using them for outreach and that sort of thing and and I think we need to work more on on art classes and art museums and and like place is that people you know you have the art like get the people to look at the art and and that from that perspective and then maybe they'll find their interest interest in science and that sort of thing and I think another really important thing is is to involve people from those communities like that's you know nobody's interested unless they're involved so it's really important that you know we make things inclusive and accessible for everybody and and you know fund people to do to do work and and bring them in and and and help you know we can learn a lot about what we're doing by have by by interacting with those with other people who aren't interested as well so I think I think that that would be my that would be my answer yeah I love that I me a shared conversation a discussion about everyone's viewpoints in space exploration and why we have different viewpoints is is so crucial for understanding the the broad array of human experiences um and how we do move forward into a future where we want to invite everyone to have a voice um in space exploration in astrobiology and more um now I will say for our questions normally we we' like our questions to kind of focus towards the guest and their their specific research and their their work and the the theme of our episode um but you know Erin you're you're very multifaceted you know you can kind of answer our questions from a broad array of different disciplines and so this next question is kind of you know not really fitting what we've discussed so far but let's have some fun and answer it anyway uh this is from someone who calls themselves Titan slayer at Aaron keller1 123 um Aon wants to know if if they want to learn or learn or work in the science of terraforming uh while working for NASA or other places that are associated with NASA um would astrobiology be a good thing to study um it's a very interesting question what do you think I mean so astrobiology looking at at life from the from the perspective of is that possible in other places you know is could life originate on other worlds and terraforming is more about taking life from Earth and bringing it to other worlds and making those worlds habitable so I think it'd be important to study astrobiology from a planetary protection aspect um you don't want to go to a planet that has indigenous life and wipe it out for the sake of putting Earth life there you know so um but I think space biology is is the field at Nasa that deals more with Earth life's response to space so if you're looking at taking you know micros up to the space station and seeing how they react or plants from Earth and putting them on Mars like that's that's more space biology than astrobiology there is some overlap in those studies um but it's more about like some some of those studies are more about the the results you're looking for or the the way you're looking at the data um but some of them are very specific to to space biology yeah I agree entirely yeah space biology bioastronautics space settlement the law of space exploration which you know there's a bunch going on in space policy right now and certainly a lot more needs to be done are all very crucial to the future of things like terraforming if we should ever choose to do terraforming and then there's also like the philosophical side of it should we be terraforming other worlds to make them habitable for Life as We Know It And and Earth life um our next question is also kind of a little bit different uh this one is from Marshall Smith who's watching on YouTube um their senior research they say just graduated with a degree in environmental science and research um so first off congratulations Marshall that's awesome um their senior research was on fungi um they want to know know if uh what you think about expanding uh in work with fungus uh related to astrobiology uh if you have an opinion on that Dr grst oh I mean there so I mean again there's a lot of fungal Research In Space biology when you're looking at like fungus from Earth you know and how that responds to space but there are if I remember right there are some like studies that involve fungi especially in exobiology so maybe I would I would you know recommend contacting the program scientist for EXO exobiology or looking at what's been funded in exobiology at Nasa and and and things like that and I'm sure that you will find some researchers interested in those areas yeah it's also worth I know Lyn Rothchild for instance at Nasa ases has done some work in her lab and some of her colleagues uh on using fungus to develop building materials for future habitation uh for Mars and Mars exploration there's a lot of cool things we can do with it there's also a lot that we're learning about development of medicines um and the history of life's Evolution through better understanding fungal Network and things like that there's a lot that we're exploring right now so definitely worth considering more um I'm going to jump to our last question here um from peara M who's watching on YouTube right now uh they want to know what majors that you pursued um throughout your education your Collegiate education most likely um to get to becoming a scientist oh so uh my first kind of my my bachelors was in molecular environmental biology um I was kind of interested in in forestry and and kind of that aspect of of studying life on Earth and and and uh then I got involved in a NASA Think Tank very early on in my kind of freshman year um and that in introduced me to astrobiology and that's kind of how you know I realized that there was this whole field asking questions about life and and and things that I that I found just fascinating and and that's that that was kind of my lead into astrobiology um at the same time I did a a Bachelor's of Bachelor of Arts in theater and performance studies with a specialization in playwriting so I didn't realize it but that came super in handy for working on the graphic history so you know never never never forget what you learned it always it all comes in handy down the line um I went on to do a masters of Space Science and uh that was in kind of Geo geomicrobiology and then a PhD in astrobiology and geomicrobiology very cool yeah I think you know you you'll find amongst us astrobiologists some folks you know they stay kind of one one field they do like you know biology undergraduate maybe Masters then PhD um and then some of us move around you know I did four different disciplines before finally finishing my doctorate um you know some of us choose different fields and some of us bring in other things that we're interested in along the way as well and explore other possible career options um so for any of them watching I think it's worth checking out um all the possible things that are available to you um so we actually have one more question that just came in from hontos on YouTube um and it's a very interesting question it's one that I get a lot and it has to do with how you might transition in your career into astrobiology if you've already started something else even if it's related um we even had that question on our poll one person wondered if they did an undergrad in biotechnology if they could still become an astrobiologist and of course yes um in biotechnology you're doing things like space biology and bioinformatics and bioastronautics and you can easily transition into a lot of things that we're doing in the realm of understanding life um but helis pontos in particular has asked um they said that they molecular biologist currently working on a PhD or has a PHD in gpcr research um if they want to switch into astrobiology after their defense for the rest of their career do you think it would be too difficult to manage no not at all I think that's that's I think that you're set up to to look at postto with people doing research that you know utilize the skills that you've learned and um yeah my my suggestion would be to to kind of read papers and find find researchers that are doing things that really interest you and just start sending them emails and talking to people um and a lot of those kind of laboratory scient Sciences you know we learn skills that are super transferable between disciplines you know I would even argue that learning to be a chef or a baker like can set you up really well to work in a lab because you're half the time you're just making peachu dishes and food for microbes but you know things so yeah I think I think there there are so many ways and and it's it's about I think it's less almost about as you study you know there's there's key skills you learn as you as you study and and just getting a degree teaches you how to study and how to organize information in your head but then when you go into a career in science it's about the question it's about finding the thing that you're really curious about and you're really willing to commit you know your life to and your life to studying and what what question needs to be answered for you yeah that's a fantastic way for us to end um answering our questions and asking you our questions uh now the print version of issue number nine of the NASA astrobiology graphic history series will be released next week in Rhode Island uh for abson 2024 I'm sure it's been a labor of love for you and also just a lot of work in general to bring it all together and so it's gonna be exciting I think for you to see it released in the print edition next week um of course for all of those watching uh you can use the link that we're dropping in the YouTube chat right now or you can jump over to the NASA astrobiology web page at astrobiology nasa.gov uh on the resources tab on the very top uh you can click that and then there's there's a link right there for the graphic histories you can find all of the past issues available there but also as of today Issue Number Nine is now available and there's a print version right there that's fantastic um and Dr grall specifically wants to remind any teachers Educators out there those working with early career researchers those who are early career researchers um to definitely check out the NASA astrologic programs resources uh there's so much on the website that that that many people have been involved in contributing over the years for education for learning about astrobiology for opportunities and developing careers there's the career suggestions page um there's a lot of great information there for you to learn uh and answer the question how do I become an astrobiologist so Dr gronstal thank you so much for joining us again for ask an astrobiologist thank you so much for having me yeah it's been a pleasure as always um maybe we'll have you back on the show again um to talk more about your wonderful work um throughout the RM of astrobiology uh for those who are watching if you want to stay in the loop on upcoming episodes of our show learn about work read articles that Dr grall has written for the NASA astrobiology website and find out more about resources from NASA astrobiology uh you can sign up for the email newsletter and get all of the cool groovy stuff that comes from NASA uh in regard to ask an astrobiologist programs workshops careers and more um and so thank you Dr grst for joining us a huge thanks to our audience for tuning in so as always thank you for joining and until next time stay curious [Music] [Applause] n [Music]
