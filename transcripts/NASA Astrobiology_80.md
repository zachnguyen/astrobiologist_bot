is there a vision you have for where maybe that the future researchers who are watching right now where their work in astrobiology and Mars exploration might take us one of the challenges of the early program was convincing people who are doing other things than quotes biology that they might be astrobiologist and so part of the strategy is laying out the things that we need to know are not just how organisms work we need to know the physical and chemical environment we need to know whether or not water was on Mars three billion years ago that sort of thing so part of it is recognizing that your role in all of astrobiology is whatever discipline you're really good at making sure you're aware of how that connects to the possibility of life I guess that's one thing the other is keep your eyes open because you don't know you know I got into this whole thing because I was just doing what I thought was interesting and then the rest has been a fun ride
