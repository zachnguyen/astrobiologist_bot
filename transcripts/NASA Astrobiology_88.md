[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a [Music] greetings friends fellow earthlings and explorers of all ages welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life in the cosmos I'm your host Dr gram the cosmobiology Lao and we're brought to you by the NASA astrobiology program and pet.org now as usual before we start our show we'd love to give a huge shout out to those of you out there tuning in live right now on YouTube watching the recorded version later on perhaps and also especially sharing about our show across the interwebs through different social media platforms your own websites your blogs talking about our guests interacting with them interacting with their books and their research and the things they do we really appreciate having this opportunity to start the conversation with all of you this month we want to give a huge shout out to an ambassador for our program the European astrobiology Institute at e astrobiology on the xplatform but also you can find about them online they're doing a lot of great things these days bringing more astrobiology meetings and more Community to Europe and other other regions um and so thank you so much to the European astrobiology Institute for sharing about this month's episode now today's episode is going to be kind of an intriguing romp through the history present and future of the astrobiology program and planetary defense programs at Nasa Through The Eyes of someone with the right expertise to share that Journey with us Dr Linda Billings is joining us today she has been a consultant to NASA's astrobiology program and the planetary defense coordination office at NASA headquarters her research interest includes science and risk communication social studies of Science and the history and rhetoric of Science and space exploration she's worked for more than 30 years as a researcher policy analyst journalist and consultant to the government Dr Billings has also contributed to many Publications in the Realms of Space Science and policy and she's contributed to the books reclaiming space Progressive and Multicultural visions of space exploration and 50 years of solar system exploration historical perspectives so thank you so much for joining us today Dr Linda Billings and welcome to ask an astrobiologist glad to be here thank you well one I'm so glad to have you on the show and I always start our show by saying that we're celebrating the science and the scientists of astrobiology but there's also so many of us working in other Realms like science communication and journalism policy all these different places that come together in in astrobiology in planetary defense and so I always love with our audience the first thing I do with our guests is to to have them share their origin story what really got them to the place they are now and I I'd love to hear given your background especially what your origin story was that brought you into your career uh over 30 years ago now I I feel like my career path has always been walking backwards because um I couldn't find a job after I finished undergrad uh School in Upstate New York and so I had a friend in Washington DC he said there's plenty of work here I came there and I got a job at a trade publishing company and after a year um I went into journalism that was not a career plan of mine I had wanted to be a social worker couldn't find a job in social work uh it was just a bad time uh recession basically um so that's how I got into journalism and I really liked it because I've always liked learning and I covered over four years I covered environment I covered energy I covered construction labor I covered government employee relations uh and then I was recruited to a smaller Publishing Company where I was covering um itic fuels development and then um with Reagan promoting the so called commercial development of space the Publishers wanted to start a new publication uh which ended up being called space business news so I did that for two years and then um went to Aaron space Mason magazine for its first two years of publication as a senior editor for space and then was recruited by John rumel basically uh to work with the NASA exobiology program program and uh it it's just these opportunities keep cropping up and I just I always like to do something new because it's a new learning experience and um went to work with exobiology and this was the time when exobiology was um funding the search for extraterrestrial intelligence project and so I was working with them on advocacy which didn't work Congress ended up canceling the program and and basically telling NASA you can't take money from other places in your budget to fund This research so since then this was 1993 um it was interesting because I was in Puerto Rico uh aoso Puerto Rico at the aoso observatory for the startup of the seti project um which was both in California and Puerto Rico so that was very interesting experience and um and then 1993 it was cancelled and so um SEI has been private ever since but I continued working with the exobiology program um and um over time John rumel became um the senior scientist for astrobiology and so when exobiology became folded into what Dan golden made into a broader astrobiology program uh John said to me I'm not going into this by myself so I'm taking you with me and um I I've just I've loved working with this Community um for the first several years when I was Consulting with NASA programs I was Consulting with human space flight programs and the more I learned about human space flight at Nasa the more I felt that it was messed up it was uh overly expensive not very competitive of course that's changed it's more competitive now but it's still very very expensive I think either the government accountability office or the uh NASA Inspector General had said recently that NASA's already spent $30 billion on emis and this is before we put people back on the moon and I wonder what the value of that is so that's the the short version of my career path it's been fascinating it's nothing I ever planned and so anyone listening if you don't know exactly what you're going to do just look for opportunities take the opportunities and see where you go from there yeah yeah you never know I mean I thought I'd be a martial arts instructor for my my adult life and now I'm I'm a researcher and a science communicator and so things like that happened um and I definitely want to talk about you know reclaiming space and issues of human space exploration scientific exploration but first I mean how incredible to be part of the NASA astrobiology program to watch them change through time from what was called exobiology and and even though yes we still have exobiology grants it is the NASA astrobiology program now which changed a lot in the '90s over to to using the term astrobiology more commonly uh you've seen a lot over the time of the program too including the different initiatives of the program like abson ABG gradon you were involved in Fame lab as well um I'd love to hear like your perspective of how the program itself has evolved through time well of course it's gotten bigger the community continues to grow and I probably have been going to abson since the first one I haven't been in person for the last couple but I will be in Providence this year yay um and it's amazing to me how the community has grown more diverse um we're at least half and half male female and and more diverse in other respects um and also younger of course that's because I'm older so a lot of the people I've gotten to know um over the past 25 30 years um are retired now and I don't see them at absons anymore but it's just wonderful to see the the growth and the richness I mean the last couple of absons I've attended most of the talks are you know the the science has gotten so complex you know we've we've done all the easy stuff you know same thing with um robotic missions you know we did um flybys and orbiters and then Landers and now we're trying to make the Landers uh more complex with sample return which I'm really worried about because it's I'm not sure NASA's going to get the money for it but that's another story um and and the same thing has been happening in the planetary defense Community I've been working that with them for 11 or 12 years and we have a lot more women um who are principal investigators um than we had 12 years ago and the community is getting younger uh so in both communities we have sort of this core small group of very senior researchers who carry a lot of history with them um and I find that the history of NASA's astrobiology program has been I've I've done some research and writing about that has been very very interesting and actually the history of astrobiology goes back before 1958 when n was established because you had Joshua lerberg and other members of the science Community who in 1956 in an international astronautical Congress started talking about we we now see that we will have the capability to send spacecraft into space and that means that we have an opportunity to look for the possibility of life on other planetary bodies so this goes back uh before there was an NASA and um NASA well NASA was established in 1958 and the first exobiology grant was um issued in 1959 and then the exobiology program was created and initially run out of NASA Ames Research Center um in 1960 and so um you know Lyn margulis was the first woman um funded by the exobiology program this was sometime in the 70s and is just I had the privilege of meeting with her and working a little bit with her what a dynamite person and of course both the guia hypothesis and also um Lynn's theory of endosymbiosis which are widely accepted in the science Community today were very controversial when they were prepared Lynn loves to tell the story about applying to the National Science Foundation for a grant and the uh program officer told her your your work is shite and don't ever apply here again and so NASA funded her work and now you know endosymbiosis is accepted um so this is what I love about the history to just see how how the field evolves and another wonderful and this came to me years ago working with astrobiology I came to understand that life and environment co evolve um I didn't really understand that until I started working um in the astrobiology community and how you know the planet shapes life life shapes the planet and this has a lot to do with how we're um looking for evidence of habitability and possibly life on other planetary bodies so it's been a a wonderful wonderful learning experience and I met so many brilliant people um doing amazing work it's just great yeah they love that so much and like David grinspoon and others have pointed out over time that life doesn't happen on a planet it happens to a planet uh life and our planet have co evolved through time and you really couldn't recognize Earth without life these days life and Earth are together and so I love that connection to LY margalus as well and this concept of the guia hypothesis this concept of like a super organism planet and what might we might look for in the future for looking for alien worlds but I do from my own perspective having come from the early career researcher realm uh supported by the NASA astrobiology program for my graduate research but also I was one of the lead organizers for ab gradon in 2016 at CU Boulder it was incredible to see how abrons over the years have helped to shape so many graduate students and and really build the community and then also I was very fortunate to compete in in Fame lab uh in 2012 and 2014 um it was a remarkable experience we don't have Fame lab anymore so some of our audience watching right now won't really know what I'm talking about um but it was an experience for a lot of us early career researchers in astrobiology ology to take part in these these short uh uh talks these short three minute talks on stage to talk about our research about specific topics in the sciences and you were crucial in bringing that to us uh to F lab USA and through NASA astrobiology so I wonder if you can share the story of how that came about for you and your involvement since you were also a judge uh in early Fame lab and also you met Nichelle Nichols I'd love to hear more about that too oh yes lovely lovely person um yeah I brought um as editor commentary editor of the journal science communication I read a commentary about Fame lab International written by a a Greek uh scholar uh and I thought God this sounds so interesting and and I I took it to Mary voch and I said do you think we could do something like this for astrobiology and to her credit she had to deal with a lot of legal I'm not going to say the bad word just a lot of legal issues and funding issues um and uh we ended up working with Fame liveb International which is based in in the UK um and adopted their model which had been um demonstrated very successfully over the past several years and so we uh set up and and Daniel scales and and Shan Domo Goldman did most of the work to get the program up so I was a little more involved in the beginning and like you say I was a judge for two or three uh years and I remember our first competition was in Houston and I know Daniela and Shan and Mary and I were all there and we we just had no idea what would happen we we knew who who had applied to compete but we had no idea um what would happen and we were very pleasant stunned by the quality of the presentations and and many of the people in that competition and also in in subsequent competitions have gone on to be very successful scientists SL science communicators and so with with that training to you know you do your initial presentation and it's a three minutes Graham was it three minutes that you had with no CRS um and judges look at the initial presentations and then the participants um have some training by experts in communication and then they come back the next day and they make a revised presentation which is always better um so it was a really really interesting experience things when um when astrobiology decided to collaborate with National Geographic things got a little more bureaucratic um but I think overall I can't remember how many years we did it five or six years I think it was very successful so maybe several dozen um young uh scientists in the astrobiology community were able to participate but they've gone and and taken what they've learned out into the community which was the whole point that was the whole point so that was a wonderful experience yeah it's great for us too amongst those of us who took part in it you know we have people like myself doing science communication professionally but we also have people who've gone on to become research scientists research professors who've gone in all kinds of other Realms in Private Industry um working for nonprofits like I do and so it's it was really impactful for a lot of our careers uh something else that was very impactful for a lot of us too has been the astrobiology primer uh so for those watching this is it started off as the primer version one which was a paper basically explaining the language of astrobiology for everyone in the community to have like a Common Language they understood these different diverse fields that come together in astrobiology it then went through version two which had many chapters and now version three is coming out soon written solely by early career Professionals in astrobiology from a diverse number of backgrounds and version three will be a a toome of of information in astrobiology um how do you see this primer kind of having evolved through time as well since you were involved as an author and editor early on for the first version it it it's evolved just like the community has gotten bigger and bigger and bigger I think the the first primer was 53 pages long or something I mean you know I could read it and I contributed a couple short passages to the first primer and then the second primer was what 70 to 100 pages and now what are we looking at a thousand pages so it it says something about not just the growth of the community but the growth of the field that the the subject matter that astrobiology deals with has just broadened and broadened and broadened over the past 20 25 years tremendously tremendously absolutely and so I love thinking about where the field has been where it's come from where it is right now um also the future of astrobiology both through NASA as well as for our community around the world of people interested in different topics relevant to our quest to understand the nature of life so we we put a poll out on YouTube um before this episode asking our audience what they think matters most for the future of astrobiology research we gave them a few options we said bigger and better space telescopes uh sending humans to Mars more robotic missions to moons and planets returning extraterrestrial samples to Earth or gave them the chance to give us their own opinions and of all of those the two that ranked the highest were more robotic missions to moons and planets and the top ranking one was returning extraterrestrial samples to Earth and so Dr Billings I wonder what what what do you think of those what what is uh the most important right now for the future of astrobiology I would have chosen more robotic missions to uh planetary bodies uh as first my only concern with the return of extraterrestrial samples is cost and you know over the past year or two there have been two independent review boards assembled by NASA and the last report of an independent review board said that this campaign we call it a campaign not a mission because there are multiple missions involved um cannot be achieved given NASA's planned budget and Congress um has said to NASA either put a cap of5 billion dollar on this Mission or you have to cancel it so I think in March we we'll get at least an interim report from the NASA team that's looking at the independent review board's uh report and so I I will mention this was uh back in September minaki wadwa who's a very well known astrobiologist and she's now uh the chief scientist for uh Mars sample return and she's a wonderful scientist very well known in the community and she wrote a really nice um not nice but it was a very wellth thought out commentary published in nature magazine about uh and the title is what bringing Space Rock back to Earth will achieve and so she made a really good case but if you're not a planetary scientist and actually if you're not a Mars scientist if you're not an astrobiologist uh there the entire space Community is not standing behind Mar sample return you know we've had uh multiple U decadal surveys from the national acmy uh of science engineering and Medicine saying that this should be a top priority a planetary Mission but we we have these cost concerns you know Europa Clipper which is very important to astrobiologists uh is costing five billion doll um and so there this competition you know we've had the Venus missions that have been delayed you know the Venus scientists are very upset about that and this is always been the case it's always been the case but now the the dollar amounts involved are much much bigger and so as I mentioned a little earlier we've done all the easy stuff we've done the flybys we've done the orbiters um and these missions are more complex and consequently they're more expensive they take more years to develop we we had this problem with the um the near Earth object surveyor Mission which was delayed by NASA for budgetary reasons and it was delayed by 2 years and consequently the cost almost doubled because of the delay um so it went from a $500 million mission to a billion dollar Mission but it was just because of that schedule delay it wasn't for any technical problems or anything like that so this is a a huge I probably pay too much attention to the daytoday ups and downs of the budget process uh when I was a journalist particularly with space business news I mean it just drove me crazy every day the budget story was different um and it wasn't over till it was over until Appropriations bills were passed and signed by the president um and that doesn't happen as often as it should these days you know we're dealing in a world of continuing resolutions so um it's not that I don't think Mar sample return is important and like I say Manny wadwa just made a really good case for why it's important uh to Mars science and to astrobiology but the rest of the community that has other interests in um icy worlds um or Venus um there's this tension there's this uh competition there's this tension with competing interests and like I say this is nothing new it's just that now now the dollar amounts are much bigger yeah absolutely there's always been that kind of competition almost amongst these different things that we want I mean a lot of us would just love the money to do all the things to go to Europa and Venus and Mars and build big telescopes and and all the things that we can do but we are limited by our funding uh to our previous poll one of our viewers who runs the astrobiology buzz account on X and is now a visiting scholar at Blue Marble space Institute of science with me uh rajat bushan Gupta he respond fonded other and he said that he thinks the most important thing for the future is making Mass awareness about the benefits of space research for Humanity so that people can call out to their leaders to increase funding um in the first place and so kind of making the more human connection to what the future of astrobiology could be arguing for more funding um and in some ways connected to that kind of arguing for more diversity more changes in the field bringing in more voices um to argue for these things as well and I feel like that might be a good segue then to your your recent book reclaiming space Progressive and Multicultural visions of space exploration um and kind of some of the more human uh side of this this whole coin the the social issues of space exploration of sending humans to space of sending robots to space and this whole collaborative of humans doing this together um I wonder if you could speak a bit about the book and and your vision for for reclaiming space what is the future for humans when it comes to space that was a a really wonderful very timec consuming project but so I was a co editor with Jamie Johnson Schwarz and Erica nesvold Jamie is a philosopher and Eric is an astrophysicist and we took probably a few months deciding who we wanted to invite to contribute um and in the end we felt like oh we could have been more diverse but that not everyone we invited to contribute was able to do so and so that was a bit of a limitation on diversity I'm probably the only contributor to that book who feels that we should not be pursuing uh the human exploration of space um pretty much everyone else um is an advocate but not the way we're going about it so we we use that term decolonization a lot and what when we're talking about decolonization we're talking about decolonizing the way we think about space like it's it's it's a a wide open space that we can do whatever we want in and take whatever we want from and so the contributors to this book are really pushing pushing against and I particularly loved um ingred LEF flor's uh chapter her introduction she's an afrofuturist and she said you know we humans are going into space carrying wounds that need to be healed before we go and zealots like Bob Zubin at the Mars Society who say you know we're going to start a new Society on Mars and everything will be different no humans have human nature has not changed for thousands of years and there will be competition there will be violence there will be greed um and I I I just I cannot buy that Vision that human societies beyond Earth will be different than human societies on Earth and if if any of you are familiar with the history of utopian societies they pretty much all failed uh because of competition because of greed uh because of you know human foibles really um and so I'm I'm very much opposed certainly I'm I'm opposed to the way we're going about uh the human exploration and exploitation of space because this this thinking actually goes back to the 15th century where uh popes issued a series of what what we called paple bulls that basically told the Portuguese and the Spanish that you're Catholics and you God has given you the right to go to explore and to either um convert the heathens or or enslave them or kill them and take whatever you want and then um that and then in the um few centuries later the Puritans left England to come to North America and and this was a Christian conception of manifest destiny that God has given us the right to go go and take Christianity to the rest of the world and take what we want take what we need and that uh Puritan um ideology became embedded in American political ideology in the 19th century of manifest destiny and I think most Americans learned about the 19th century political ideology of manifest destiny but not about its historical roots and so this is a very deeply embedded belief system that you know we Western Christian humans have have the right to expand in the case of the United States expand Westward take what we need take the land um get rid of indigenous peoples who are in the way of what we want to take um and I I just find that way of thinking very uh dangerous and my chapter in the book is is critiquing the neoliberal ideology of exploration which doesn't get I'm I'm working on another paper for another conference that gets into this the religious roots of this ideology but the neoliberal ideology is all about free enterprise free market private property rights um and this is so we're taking belief systems that have done a lot of damage on Earth and we're planning to take them into space and I have a big problem with that yeah it's a good it's a good transition too then into the realm of space law and space policy and are we even prepared right now from a legal standpoint from a national or or a a multinational standpoint to deal with any of these issues um you know I was just the other day in the sauna at my gym talking to a couple from Finland and we're discussing differences from around the planet of you know human thought and and how people have gotten to this point like for Americans this idea of like this rugged you know individualism that we have and and a lot of it does come from the concepts of manifest destiny and Westward Expansion and American exceptionalism um but we also see these other you know these nationalistic xenophobic kind of Tendencies from around the world through time we've seen them happen we've also seen these Tendencies to push out and to conquer and take over and you know when it comes to law you know you even mentioned like there there was a law driving that forward there there were you know ideas driving it forward but are we prepared to protect anything in the future both on Earth and Beyond with current space law um you know you you've done a lot in the realm of space policy how do you envision right now space policy giving us leverage or lacking for the future right now I can only speak uh in any detail to us space policy um I think the um the primary goal of us space policy is to enable uh commercial activity to uh support and advocate for commercial activity everything else comes after that um we do have some um National strategies for um the development of CIS lunar space that space between low earth orbit and the moon um have a lot of proposals for private space stations and I heard uh a guy with the US space force several months ago he was giving a talk and he said I can't wait till we see a a Walmart and low earth orbit and I just said h no I don't think that's a good idea but so the fundamental space law which most of your viewers will probably be familiar with is the 1967 uh United Nations outer space treaty which has served well since 1967 um my mentor Eileen Galloway was one of the authors of that treaty and I agree with her that we don't need another treaty there have been various voices saying we need another treaty because you know the space business has changed a lot which it has you know there are a lot more players involved it both nationally and commercially um but iene said what what we need is an appropriate regulatory regime which we do not have um we we don't have one in the United States uh and basically the treaty I think I don't have it memorized but I think basically the treaty says that um signatories the nation states need to be responsible for the activities of whether it's a government agency or a company for the activities originating from that country and so there's been a lot of talk uh amongst space policy people about possible regulatory regimes but um the corporate world pushes back because the corporate world they they love this term light touch regulation which means as little as possible and maybe none there have been some people who say well we should let corporations self regulate their space activities no that's not going to work uh we we can see how corporations operate it's all about profit um and no Corporation is going into space for altruistic reasons it's all about profit it drove me crazy when um oh gosh this was almost 10 years ago I think when these two asteroid mining companies popped up and have since gone out of business and plan monary resources said we're going to mine The Asteroids for the benefit of humanity no a mining company Minds for the benefit of the company uh not for the benefit of humanity and this this is also NASA's um justification for sending people back to the moon and eventually on to Mars they say they're doing this for the benefit of humanity but when you ask these officials who keep repeating this Mantra we're doing this for the benefit of humanity and you say how can you give me some details about how these activities are benefiting all Humanity or even all Americans you don't get an answer uh so obviously um space exploration has benefited all of humanity in some really important ways with um Earth observing Satellites with weather satellites you know a lot of these activities in low earth orbit have benefited everyone including poor nations in Africa um you know the United Nations holds all kinds of training workshops um teaching people how to use remote sensing data for land use planning um agriculture planning things like that but human exploration I don't know I I I cannot see I I hope someone can sometime explain to me how human exploration benefits Humanity but I haven't gotten an answer yet intriguing well I will say so we saw this this Pew research poll that came out fairly recently polling Americans on the the impacts what are the most important things that NASA is doing that space exploration is doing so we asked our audience who are watching live right now on YouTube um true or false do most Americans think that the primary issue should be monitoring asteroids and objects that could hit Earth um of our audience who are watching 59% said that was true and 40% sent said false um so a nice even split and of all the options that folks in that Pew research poll had to choose from the one they picked the most was monitoring asteroids um and so that is one way that NASA is giving back and could benefit humanity is to help us avoid going extinct um and you've worked you know as a consultant for planetary defense I I wonder um how do you envision where we are right now with planetary defense and the future of planetary defense as a benefit for Humanity people in the planetary defense Community like to say that um an asteroid a devastating asteroid impact with Earth is a disaster that we can prevent as opposed to We Can't prevent hurricanes we can't prevent earthquakes we can't prevent tsunamis um but we can prevent catastrophic asteroid impacts um and the the good news is well as of now all known um asteroids are not an on an impact course with Earth for for the next 100 years but what what we're working on particularly with the near Earth object surveyor Mission which will be a dedicated space based um asteroid Observatory uh which can operate 247 right now all of our observing capabilities are groundbased and if the moon is full you can observe if the weather's bad if the sky is full of clouds you can't observe you can only observe at night and so observing capability is limited in that sense even though the observing capabilities of these uh groundbased telescopes have gotten better and better more refined over time and so having that space based Observatory uh will be really important and the other part of planetary defense uh planning is uh collaborating and this is not just um in the US but also in Europe um and I think even in Russia um collaborating with Observer um collaborating with um Emergency Management officials um planetary defense uh NASA's planetary defense office is working with FEMA the Federal Emergency Management agency uh to hold its fifth what we call tabletop exercise uh later this year which will what we do is we develop um a scenario a credible scenario you know based on science of an impending catastrophic impact of an asteroid with Earth and then we sort of work through what what C can we prevent the impact that's the first question if we can't prevent it then how do we prepare for the impact and that's where Emergency Management people come in because they coordinate at the local level um in planning for disasters and so um just like with astrobiology the planetary defense community has grown and and the work that it does has expanded because the budget has expanded now I wish I wish astrobiology budget would expand a little more than it has over the years but um over the course of five years I think the planetary defense budget don't help any this but it either quadrupled or quintupled over a period of five years um the Obama Administration really pumped extra money um into the planetary defense budget it's still isn't big enough to send a dedicated mission to apus you know the famous asterite apus is making a close approach to Earth not on an impact course in 2029 but with a close approach it's a great opportunity uh to observe up close um this fairly well known asteroid and um I think right now NASA's plan is um to um repurpose the Osiris Rex uh spacecraft what do we call it now Osiris Apex um but to send that spacecraft um to observe Aus uh in in I think 2029 so um we're we're working on it you know and like I say in both of these communities we're doing more and more because the community keeps growing I love it well I see we have a bunch of questions coming in from our audience who are watching right now on YouTube before we get to that we're going to switch gears a little bit and move to our faster than light segment this is where we just ask some very simple quick questions for short answers that we ask of all of our guests just to get an idea of what everyone across the realm of astrobiology is thinking um first off famously enrio fery at a lunch at Los Alamos had asked everyone like where are they in response to like this idea that if we could travel faster than light or if we could get across the Galaxy in any kind of time why aren't aliens here now and so for you Dr Billings what is your favorite answer to F's question where are they well my my favorite answer which is pretty much tongue and cheek is they don't want anything to do with us because we've made such a mess of ourselves here um the more serious answer is that it's not so much where are they but we we understand very little about human intelligence and even less about nonh human terrestrial intelligence and to think that we will able will be able to recognize uh signs of extraterrestrial intelligence and actually communicate I find very hard to swallow yeah absolutely um you know we don't know yet how we're going to communicate if we can communicate those are huge questions in astrobiology um let's talk about another question then um I understand you do like to read a lot of fiction I love reading a lot of fiction myself especially Science Fiction and Fantasy I also play video games watch movies I wonder what stories have inspired you to want to know more about life in the universe oh my gosh pretty much everything when when I was 12 years old in my hometown of Johnson City New York when I was 12 I was able to take books out of the adult section of the library and I had never heard of Science Fiction but it was in a separate section and so I just started at the A's and read through and stay up late at night probably 12 13 14 maybe 15 age 15 I was reading a lot of Science Fiction and so it just made me curious uh curious about possibilities um and lately I'm sorry to say during the pandemic I became addicted to what I call Escapist literature Murder Mysteries and so I'm reading a lot of murder mysteries but every once in a while I try to throw in some serious literature but they all uh in inspire me um one of the books I read not too long ago was called the dictionary of lost words and it was a a novel about the the team of men um who wrote The Oxford English Dictionary and it took them decades uh but the um protagonist in the story Esme is the daughter of one of these men and they're throwing out slips of paper with words they think should not go in the dictionary and she starts to collect collect them and ends up she actually becomes a very famous um linguist uh as an adult so it just makes me think about you know language and words we consider legitimate and of course we always hear about the new words that are added to the Oxford English Dictionary every year um yeah I I just fiction really helps me think about new things I love it yeah you know just like in astrobiology where we're thinking about worlds that we don't even know if they actually exist we're thinking about possible aliens we don't know if they actually exist in a lot of ways fantasy fiction they allow us to explore worlds that don't really exist in our own reality but they exist within the writing and the pages that we share with each other through time books are incredible oh and one of my favorite um science fiction novels I read it several years ago if if you haven't read it I would highly recommend it the sparrow by Mary Doria Russell and I actually had the privilege of going to a workshop at the center of theological inquiry and Mary Doria Russell was there and so we all got to hear her explain like how she came to write this story which is I just remember getting to a point where I felt like I'd been punched in the gut um so I don't want to you know give away what the book is about but it was just a beautifully told disturbing story story and then there was another book another science fiction book now I can't remember the name of it but it was about a a man who was sent to another uh planetary body um to um he was a minister and there there were there was an intelligent species on the planet and somehow or other they had learned about the Bible and they wanted to learn more about the Bible and so he was sent there to teach them more about the Bible and they built a church I just can't remember the name of the book uh but it was a really again just thought provoking um story intriguing um So within your career you know you mentioned that you started off kind of in journalism and then started learning about space topics later but all these other topics in The Sciences you've had a long career of Consulting through these different programs through NASA but if you you could go back to the beginning of your career and give yourself some advice what would you say maybe be a little more adventurous um and you know a little more outgoing I mean I've been very very lucky um of course now I live in Sarasota Florida so I don't need and I'm 72 years old so I don't need to do a lot of networking but um I'm my nature is that I'm shy and so I probably could have been a little more um aggressive shall we say in in my Outreach uh to the community but again I've been very lucky I've just met wonderful people who have been very helpful and encouraging to me um and one thing I want to stress particularly living here in Florida um that for all my years of education um and uh employment no one has ever told me that I couldn't think that I couldn't say that and I couldn't write that no one has ever said no you you need to stay within the lines you know you need to stay within the lines and I think that's really important for all of us to uh just know your values stick to them and don't give in to pressure I love it so much um so given you know your realm of research your realm of Consulting what is something that excites you right now about the future oh everything the political future I don't want to go there that doesn't it disturbs me um but the scientific future oh my gosh who knows who I mean it you know I read Science magazine and nature magazine every week and there's just something mind glowing in every issue um you know whatever field you're you know there there's there's a category of um uh papers in these journals called condensed matter physics I don't know what condensed matter physics is and I don't understand artificial intelligence I've read many many articles about it I just don't understand it uh so I have a lot to learn but there's always something new um always something new in those m magazines which is why I read them every week fantastic there so much to learn uh so much for each of us to contribute in uh the final question of our faster than light segment what's an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind the fact that more cells in the human body are microbial than human it it still blows my mind I know it's true and my my when I told this to my partner he said how how can how can that be and I said because human cells are bigger than microbial cells and that's you know so but we are colonies human bodies are colonies of organisms and you know we have clumps of human cells we have colonies of microbial cells uh we with um the human microbiome project I can't remember which president initiated that but we've learned so much from the funding that was provided um for research in the human microbiome project wi which I find very fascinating awesome I love it um yeah there's just so much for us to learn and it is it is kind of crazy to think how many beings exist inside of us and on us um I love it so much um I am going to jump now to some of our audience questions we don't have a lot of time um but a huge thank you to all of you asking questions out there I'll try my best to get to as many of them here as I can um with a few minutes we have left I want to start with a question from SI saner pallet um sier wants to know uh how you think NASA astrobiology can serve as an example for government and non governmental space agencies across the globe um to set up specialized astrobiology counterparts of their own very good question and I think the NASA astrobiology program already has done that for some countries Spain has a very um well organized um astrobiology Research Center um Australia does um who else uh France has a pretty uh vigorous astrobiology community and as you mentioned earlier um the European astrobiology Institute is pulling together researchers and um disseminating information on funding opportunities sometimes from National governments sometimes for the from the European Union um and so um I I think like I say I think NASA already has served as an example um and um we can sort of propagate the model which which is already propagated beyond the United States um to uh create astrobiology programs in other countries yeah good question yeah I love it yeah I think especially I know SI San himself is in India um India I I speak to students on a weekly basis from across India who want to be involved in astrobiology and I think in the near future I I could very much see ISRO eventually having an astrobiology program of their own to really give more opportunity in India for the young students right now who want to be involved so um I'm very ful for that as well um we have a question from rendering reality 3D animations here on YouTube um about how our technology has now allowed us to understand that there are potentially hazardous objects out there um those things have caused some fear um they want to know if we could flip this around and maybe use these neear objects that could be hazardous um perhaps as taxis or spacecraft of their own to explore the solar system I guess what do you think about that as the technological development is turning these things into spacecraft uh I'm not an engineer but I don't think it's feasible uh because these objects are traveling you know there everything in the solar system is affected by the gravity of everything in the solar system and so these these asteroids are on a trajectory on their orbits around the Sun Sometimes they come close to a planet sometimes they don't just uh just a few days ago uh a small object it was the eighth um asteroid um detected before impact and when I say impact not with the surface but with the atmosphere and it exploded um in the sky over Berlin so it was very well observed because it was detected there's there's this I can't remember his name but he's a Hungarian astronomer and he's I I think the man never sleeps because he keeps finding these things just before they enter Earth's atmosphere um but um these are small objects once I saw a bowy it was in the morning it was a very small object but just just very um distinctive you know boom you see this bright light that disappears really quickly um I don't think that we could use asteroids as taxis I I I just I I don't like I say I'm not an engineer but I have never heard that proposed at a planetary defense conference let me put it that way yeah yeah and who knows maybe a private company will want to do that in the future which brings us back around to private companies private space exploration our next question comes from Felipe Benitez uh fipe wants to know um due to NASA's limitations in budget especially for things like you know looking for alien life out there uh search for EXT restrial life uh Felipe wants to know what you think the role might be of private companies in the near future when it comes to looking for life out there do you foresee a future where private companies take over searching for alien life and I guess for myself then to add to that do you think there's good or bad about that uh for the future of humanity I think the billionaires should be funding a lot more space missions we we've created I mean uh I don't have the exact numbers in my head but in 1984 when I was writing space business news there were 14 billionaires in the United States today there are more than 700 billionaires in the United States billionaires um and I I wish you know each billionaire has his or her special interests um but uh we have a few who have entered the space industry and express an interest and I I just wish they would spend more of their own money um on on space missions the the bad is it's not necessarily the bad but um uh companies might not be as attentive to requirements of space law or uh for instance the Federal Aviation Administration which licenses um launches uh from the United States um they might not be as attentive and there was a bit of a flap when um I hate to even mention his name Elon Musk launched his Tesla Road Roadster the FAA licensed that launch but there was no plan for of flight and there was there was no plan for planetary protection in other words was there uh microbial contamination on that payload so to speak and what about if it crashes into a potentially habitable planetary body so that's the kind of concern I have about um private missions just deciding we're we're going to do it ourself and you remember the um Israeli guy who crashed grades on the moon and it he didn't tell anybody he he put the  grades on the which was not a huge problem because we consider the moon not habitable but it was just the fact that it was a private mission that was not completely open about what was on the spacecraft and so we can see we can anticipate I think more of that happening even though I think the billionaires should be spending more money on space missions uh especially certain ones who've expressed an interest um but yeah that's that's the downside and like we were talking about earlier we don't have an appropriate regulatory regime in place and of course regulatory regimes we have uh uh to manage um terrestrial activities uh are violated all the time um for instance in the mining industry um so I don't know I'm I'm not uh I'm not completely hopeful that more and more private sector activity in space will be a good thing except for those companies yeah and so I have one more question I want to bring up from the audience and again thank you to all of you who are asking your questions right now on the live chat um please keep reaching out to all of us online in astrobiology we'll try our best to answer your questions about our specific fields of expertise but this brings me back around to another question from sioner pallet again uh saner asks if we should make any modifications to the outer space treaty to meet current situations in space exploration and the Very issue of perhaps sending tardigrades or sending organisms on our spacecraft we don't really have any policy that controls private companies in how much they have to clean anything they send to space or avoid contaminations of space and that also brings the question to my mind um and one that's very important for a lot of us in astrobiology is is who gets to speak for Earth if it ends up being a private company that is the first that gets to have contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence uh who gets to speak for Earth will it be one of those billionaires running a private company who gets to speak on behalf of of eight billion human beings or should we amend the outer space treaty in some way that can help us to maybe perhaps re in how Private Industry is allowed to do these things in the realm of astrobiology it's a really good question uh I don't and I'm greatly influenced by all my years being mentored by alen Galloway that the way I said it at her um celebration of life after she died is and she would not use these words she was much more Gentile but my interpretation is don't mess with the treaty it's it's served us well for all these years and what what we need is appropriate Regulatory regimes and as I mentioned earlier um that's up to the individual nation states um to regulate uh space activities originating um um from their countries um I don't think we need another treaty um I don't think we need to amend the treaty although there I've been listening to space lawyers for years and years and years and they is a huge range of interpretations of various um segments of the treaty and I heard a space lawyer um say I guess it was last month at a meeting and I need to follow up with him to see if I heard him right he said there is is no obligation under international law to share the benefits of your space activities now I just haven't followed up with him yet but I was very concerned to hear him say that um and again uh the corporate world looks at the outer space treaty and they and they see all the places you know where they can say oh this language is fuzzy you know and they have different interpretations of of what various Clauses mean well fantastic well Dr Linda Billings thank you so much for joining us for asking my questions for
