[Music] in this lecture we'll look at density of exoplanets and what we can learn about density and fundamental nature density of course is not the same as mass density is the distribution of mass or the mass per unit volume of a substance measured in units of kilograms per cubic meter or grams per cubic centimeter in the metric system mass is a measure of an object's resistance to acceleration measured in kilograms or grams so two objects can have the same mass but wildly different densities for example glass and lead have densities that differ by a factor of four or five lead is more than four times as dense as glass which means in lead the atoms are packing at the microscopic fundamental level four times as many particles per cubic centimeter than the composition of glass and these are both solids if you go to gases the range and densities is even larger as we've seen exoplanet density can be measured assuming we have two independent measures of the exoplanet one from the radial velocity method which is used to measure the mass and one from the transit method which is used to measure the size of the nearly four 000 exoplanets that have been discovered so far roughly 10 percent of them or almost 400 have both measurements so we have had density measurements of some precision for several hundred exoplanets at this point and this is the most valuable information we can get because it tells us more about what's going on in these systems however knowing a mean density one number does not uniquely tell us the composition because there are many models that can match a single mean density there was a lot of excitement in the exoplanet community a few years ago when a small planet was found where the density was measured and the implication was that it could be a water world a set of small telescopes was used to detect an exoplanet transiting in front of a nearby red dwarf star the aside here is that not only are we looking for planets around sun like stars but we're also looking for planets around dwarf stars recall that most of the stars in the milky way galaxy are actually red dwarf stars so if you restricted your viewing to sun like stars that's less than 10 percent of the population we want to know if exoplanets are a universal phenomenon and in particular we want to know if they exist around all types of stars so only in the last decade have surveys been extended to dwarf stars in this case the estimate was that the size of the planet was just under three times the earth size a separate measurement using the radial velocity method came up with a mass of about six times the earth that suggests a mean density of 1.8 grams per cubic centimeter compared to water with a density of one gram per centimeter that suggested the planet might be composed largely of water if it were composed primarily of metals and rocks like the earth for example then it would have a substantially higher density factor of two or three higher so this large density but not large enough to be primarily rocky or metallic suggested that this could be a body where there's a substantial fraction of its mass in the form of water now that's not a total surprise because in our solar system we know of smaller objects in space where there are almost equal mixtures of rock and ice frozen so it's not unprecedented it was a very exciting discovery when it first happened however the planet might have a small dense metallic core surrounded by a large hydrogen atmosphere that would give the same mean density however that was ruled out because the star would then rapidly boil away that atmosphere so it would not be a permanent feature it's more likely and most probable that this planet has a core made of solid water or ice because the red dwarf star gives insufficient intensity at that orbital distance for the water to be liquid and then a small hydrogen atmosphere surrounding which is expected for a planet orbiting so close to its star both of these structures would yield the same mean density so it's likely out there in the universe and in space and in the milky way galaxy there are many different compositions of planets here are some possible planet structures some of these have been observed and some not will show an earth mass planet or a direct earth analog and for comparison in the background you can see the size of the sun and then a super earth actually quite a large super of the five earth masses and in this case we see six different possible compositions ranging from high density planets that are made primarily of metals to planets that are made entirely of rock to planets that are made of carbon which be relatively light compared to silicates and carbonates in rock to the pure water world that we saw an example of recently to gas giant planets small giant planets made of carbon monoxide carbon dioxide or hydrogen and helium so these are possible compositions and nature could in fact have made all of these and as the exoplanets are studied in more detail we've started to see an amazing diversity of their mean densities and therefore their inferred compositions the subject is called comparative planetology and it starts in the solar system where we try and understand the common features of the solar system based on similarities and differences between the planets in our solar system the primary difference is between the small rocky terrestrial planets close into the sun and the large gas giants further out a secondary difference comes from composition where we've seen the condensation curve that describes where different ingredients will condense or be possibly seen in their metallic liquid or solid form as opposed to vapor and so close in all the way to the orbit of mercury we can have the condensation of iron nickel and silicates so expect those solid materials but that close in the ices will be vaporized and driven off and liquid will not be possible so we don't expect to see water methane or ammonia only further out in the colder outer regions of the solar system are we going to see liquids at the sweet spot the habitable zone for the earth and then those volatiles as chemists call them in the frozen form as we move into the outer part of the solar system so the comparative planetology subject started from our own solar system where astronomers and planetary scientists wanted to understand the nature of the relationship between the planets and the underlying principles of how they formed and are structured and here you can see a composite of the cross sectional structures or interior structures of the terrestrial planets compared to the gas giant planets so carefully studying the planets of our solar system hopefully tells us about the general situation of planetary structures and this in turn can inform our theory of how planets form in general and help improve our interpretation of the exoplanet data that's coming in so in this lecture we've seen that we can learn a lot about exoplanets from their mean density but not everything mean density is just one number and planets have detailed composition differentiation meaning denser materials fall to the center less dense materials on the periphery and of course they're surrounded by atmospheres made of light gases so we can calculate this mean density and it's indicative of a very broad categorization of planets perhaps into gas dominated water worlds rock dominated or metal dominated but in practical terms many exoplanets are likely to be composites or complex and so there's a limit to what a single mean density can tell us [Music]
