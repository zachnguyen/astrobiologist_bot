what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind I've said before I'm not great with factoids I'm not one of those people that has like a rod decks of cool things or jokes in my head I would have to kind of go back to research that I've been involved with I did deep subsurface microbiology and that I always found fascinating and I always found it fascinating about the idea of just how deep in the earth can you go and still find life and then you're thinking about as it gets hotter and hotter as you approach the Earth's core like when does it get just too hot for metabolism to happen when does stuff just start breaking down and you know it's it's difficult to get underground it's difficult to look for stuff but it's kind of like as deep as we've gone we've still found microorganisms figuring out a way to survive down there and I just think that's incredible
