here we are in the ocean biome of biosphere 2 a research facility north of tucson arizona what the biosphere represents is a self contained ecosystem biosphere 2 of course refers to this man made structure but biosphere 1 is the earth itself which is a self contained ecosystem hurtling through space welcome my name's chris impe i'm a professor of astronomy and associate dean at the university of arizona and this is a massive open online class or mooc on astrobiology so the topic is the search for life in the universe is this situation you see here with water and rocks and living creatures and life forms is this unique in the universe only on this planet or can we find these situations elsewhere astrobiology is asking one of the biggest questions in science are we alone in the universe not just are we alone as intelligent species but are we alone as living in a biological world evidence is as you'll see that there are many many living planets elsewhere in the galaxy in the universe billions perhaps less certain is how many of those planets have life on them especially intelligent life water is essential for life as far as we know it biologists don't know exactly how to define life but they almost always say it needs carbon as a basis for forming complex molecules and water as a medium for complexity and for life to evolve and persist and become more complex is that stability that sweet spot for life where it does have to be habitable zone which implies between freezing point of water and the boiling point of water so the earth represents a sweet spot water is a sweet spot and and these are lessons of course we see at the biosphere as well as on our whole planet so we'll look at all of these questions including the extremes of life on this planet and the possibility that life exists even in the solar system as well as on distant earth like worlds towards the end we'll ask the more difficult question of whether intelligent and technological civilizations exist whether we're alone in the sense of having pen pals people we can communicate with and convey our situation in the universe and they do the same to us astrobiology is highly interdisciplinary it's based on astronomy but it also involves geology planetary science and of course biology and chemistry so we'll look at a lot of topics along the way i hope you'll join me for this exciting journey into life in the universe
