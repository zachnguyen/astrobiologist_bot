[Music] hi I'm Miriam and I'm here to talk about the salt of the earth and how they could help when looking for life in the solar system Earth can provide us with analogs that can mimic extra planetary environments and one of the most ones most often used for Mars is the Atacama Desert I'm really proud of this graphic so in the Atacama life has been shown to live off the deli questions of salts but uh can the salts that I studied deliquest in Autumn conditions so for my project I tried to answer two scientific questions could nitrate salts or their salt mixtures uptake water or release water sorry uptake or release water under autocom environmental conditions and could the temperature and relative humidity values lead to nitrate salt deloquiescence so to answer this we used a Ramen microscope attached to an environmental cell in which the temperature and relative humidity could be controlled and we used this to study the phase transitions of our salts of Interest so we can answer our first question could nitrate salts or salt mixtures take up water under autocommer conditions well yes and thank you for coming to my talk um so but let me tell you why and so the first thing that we're going to do is look at the spectral series of the pure magnesium nitrate um so if we look at the crystalline nitrate which is going to be shown by the black Spectra at the bottom it starts off at a higher wave number of 1062 and as we increase the as we decrease the relative sorry increase the decrease the temperature and increase the relative humidity it's going to stay there until it reaches the deli questions relative humidity of 63 percent um at which point it shifts the lower wave number of 1052 so it's going to stay here and this is really cool it's going to stay here and as we increase the temperature and decrease the relative humidity it stays at that lower wave number until the efflorescence relative humidity of 23 and that means that magnesium nitrate the pure one can maintain a metal stable brine for over a 40 RH change range um so we repeated these experiments multiple times over different temperatures and we made this lovely phase diagram uh and it's as temperature versus relative humidity so for the pure magnesium nitrate has a hydrate the Dell questions is going to be shown by the blue dots and the efflorescence is shown by the orange squares and it was a relatively temperature independent and occurred around 25 RH so magnesium nitrate exhibited a very large hysteresis which you can tell by the gap between the Dell questions and the fluorescence relative humidity and this is going to be our meta stable brine region but I also mentioned salt regions so what about them so we did the exact same experiment but we used um different salts so we have magnesium nitrate so this is a one to one mixture and we have magnesium nitrate on the left and magnesium per chlorate on the right and we see that same shift in the nitrate Peak which we use to determine when dull questions would occur and so we took different ratios of chlorate and nitrate and we looked at how the pcori can influence the water uptake of the nitrate salts in the soil and so the blue dots once again are going to be the Dell questions and the orange triangles are the efflorescence um and then the lines in between is the average of the experiment so what we can see is that for chlorate seem to be helping or assisting with the magnesium nitrate water uptake or deloquiescence and so if we look at our overall picture so this is pure magnesium nitrate and its Dell questions is at 60 RH however if we look at our pechlorate mixtures we can see that the water uptake seems to be assisted by that and we see this with the downward facing Trend um so we also wanted to look at what affects a less hygroscopic or deliquisite salt would have on that and so we did a one to one mixture with sulfate nitrates and we saw that this did not inhibit the water uptake of nitrate because it's still below the deloquiescence relative humidity of magnesium nitrate so finally we can answer our last question which is could the temperature and relative humidity values lead to nitrate salt deloquistence in the soil um so we took our phase diagram and we took relative humidity and temperature datus from these two sites in the Atacama Desert and both of these sites contain nitrates perchlorates in the soil composition and also sulfates so site a which you see above was relatively close to the ocean and was therefore warmer and more humid this was likely a contributor to why the nitrate cells in the soil could maintain a stable liquid brine which is shown by the dark blue highlights and a metastable line which is the light blue highlights throughout most of the year then if we look at site B this was more Inland and therefore significantly drier and colder but despite this we do have points throughout the year in which the salts could uptake and deliquest and maintain a medicinal place so of course this is very highly variable and that could be due to the different environmental conditions as well as the different soil compositions and would need to be further studied so um if you have any questions comments concerns or a job please stop by my poster um which is number 23 so thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music]
