[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] friends and fellow earthlings and my fellow crew of the spaceship earth welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life I'm your host Dr Graham the cosmo biologist Lao and we're brought to you by the NASA astrobiology program and segnet.org now you might have noticed in the ramp up for today's show not only do we have an all new season here in 2023 we also have all new music all new graphics new logos a huge thanks to the artist Melissa flower for developing this new set of logos for us we hope that you're really excited for the show this year just like we are we have so much to bring you it's now over 50 episodes of is episode 54 of ask an astrobiologist and it has been quite a ride so with our new change in logos we thought we'd bring back the original host from the very first episode of the show started uh and who handed off the hosting to me as well before we introduce that host though I do want to say a huge thank you to all of you who are watching now live all of those who watch the recording later thank you to all of you for tuning in for joining in this quest with us and learning more about the nature of life with us and learning more about what all these awesome astrobiologists do we especially want to give a shout out to debashree das who is at Deb underscore Astro nerd on Twitter uh Deb shared about our show and got some engagement for it and it's always helpful for us to have our ambassadors out there in the world sharing about the show talking about the show and asking questions for our guests so like I said today's episode is going to be pretty incredible we are bringing back on the OG host of ask an astrobiologist to chat with me about his research his work in science communication his work as a businessman or business person uh and and doing entrepreneurship uh and this is Dr sanjoy Sam who's rejoining me here again for ask an astrobiologist Dr Sam is a scientist an engineer and social entrepreneur who's passionate about space exploration and astrobiology um and so welcome to the show sanjoy thank you so much for joining us so great to be background hello to you hello to the team and hello to all of you who are watching it's such a privilege to be back and it's so great to have you son Joy you're you have such a huge background from engineering through science doing geochemistry studying thermodynamics and there's so much that you've done I actually want to start the show though talking about some of your work as an entrepreneur in developing Sega net and Blue Marble space and how you became an entrepreneur in your career talk about that it was not something I really planned to begin with when I was a grad student I was very active in the space conference circuit and I give a presentation at the international astronautical Congress where I was advocating that um astronauts should wear a common symbol when exploring space so you know instead of their national flag or in addition to the national flag we're a symbol that really represents Humanity because once they're in space they're all ambassadors of planet Earth first and foremost and then of course um representatives of their home Nations but first and foremost they're ambassadors of planet Earth so surprisingly the talk was really well received I got some really good feedback and that the plundery session during that conference um there was some important head of space agencies as giving presentation and during the Q a session somebody asked him what flag should Humanity return to the moon when Humanity does in fact return to the moon and he answered uh all the flags of all the nations so I giant face pound myself because like that seems very impractical so but I still had the flag for my presentation of like the the morning off which is just a picture of a picture of the Earth so I Rose my hand and somebody gave him the microphone and I said well what about this flag I kind of showed it to everybody in the audience and to the to the speaker and like to my biggest surprise the entire audience started clapping like it really resonated with people so I went to the stage and gave him the flag and once I got back home I was thinking more about this moment because it's one of those few moments in life that kind of shake your soul a little bit and uh I decided to go to this decided to see how far this idea will go so I started with Rumble space and as an organization as a non profit um to push this idea so to sell flags and stickers and patches to promote a common symbol of international unity in Exploration I wrote a paper that was published in space policy which is still I think the only paper peer reviewed paper that has such a symbol as a proposition for Humanity and things kind of took off from there you know in after finishing a PhD and a postdoc I had a drink with my close colleague and good friend Jacob hack misra deciding what do we want to do with our career and uh we thought that starting a non profit that really focuses on the human aspect of Science and science communication and getting people excited about science was something different that didn't quite exist yet where you know science communication is really built into the fabric of the organization and uh learned how to you know do business with the government and then I went to do business school while doing my postdoc evening classes kind of learn the language of business accounting Finance operations all that things and then went for it and here we are you know it's 12 years later and it's still going strong and it's doing things that I could have never imagined no I love it so much and uh for our audience if you don't know uh I I joined Blue Marble space in 2017 after finishing my PhD and became the director of communications and marketing for the organization uh you can learn more about Blue Marble space at bluemarlespace.org as well as the Blue Marble space Institute of science at bmsis.org um and so it's interesting to see you know this this pivotal moment in your career and I actually I actually happen to have my flag patch right here there you go awesome of our Earth um in that moment where you shared that flag was like that that precipitous moment in your life that kind of impacted you to make this big change and become a social entrepreneur and create an organization that um you know not only the scientists that we've served but also so many young students now from around the world have been part of Blue Marble space through the young scientists program through the visiting Scholars Program through various other opportunities that you've offered I wonder if you can speak for a moment to your vision for how important it is to bring in a younger Scholars younger researchers and and to Mentor them to become scientists and Engineers to the Future I think it's the most important thing we can do I mean science is a universal language of our society it doesn't matter what you believe what language you speak what the color of your skin is science brings us together is a there's one way of understanding the world that provides progress to to society um and you know it's bringing these these kids together from all over the world to work together for a summer at least in our young scientist program and bathe them in the spirit that by working together on common problems the diversity of your opinions into how that problem should be solved enhance the quality of the work and the potential solution to address this problem so I think like getting more and more people from all over the world to do scientific research is kind of bring Humanity together and by goodness do we need that these days absolutely and I didn't mention in your introduction your background you started off in engineering you started off studying aerospace engineering you earned your Bachelor's in 2002 from fit in 2004 you earned a master's from University of Washington uh also in the realm of Aeronautics and astronautics and then you made the switch over to doing geological Sciences planetary sciences and astrobiology for your PhD at the University of Washington I'm wondering you know what what intrigued you in making that switch from from aerospace engineering uh moving over to the Sciences for your PhD it's again one of these moments that happened in your life that you didn't quite expect so I was very happy as an aerospace engineer I was doing a focus in in fluid mechanics that is the physics of air and water and the department required taking classes outside of the department but in the same general realm so University of Washington has a fantastic atmospheric sciences department so I looked I signed up for a class in planetary atmospheres and the professor for that class uh Professor David catling is an astrobiologist and I had never heard the term Master biology right I discovered it quite late in my academic career I was like halfway through a masters before I learned what astrophology was and so he thought that class was that spirit and that completely blew my mind and I remember like spending all my time working on the paper for that class which was on the topic of water on Mars and kind of neglecting my not neglecting but not spending as much effort on the engineering classes and that got my head turning it's like oh my gosh like this is like what should I do what should I do kind of had quarter life crisis I guess I could say and then I made the decisions like okay ultimately you want to be excited about what you study and um and this new field of astrobiology because it's so much philosophical as well as rigorous really attracted me and so I decided to finish the Masters and start a PhD in a discipline I knew nothing of I didn't know anything about geology or geophysics or astrobiology but I had incredible support from my mentors at the University there who believed in me and they didn't have to I was really a liability when I first started but they believed in me and I'm still grateful very much to this day and you know loaded myself as classes I was finishing my my masters while at the same time starting the PHD loaded myself with classes for like for like two or three years I was taking introduction to geology you know as a freshman you know just like really loading myself with classes and I just loved every single one of them it was just so interesting so that that made me realize I made the right choice and I just went from there you know I still managed to finish in six years or that was a lot of work but um you know I don't regret it since I think the background in engineering and the PHD in science gives me a niche in how I approach problems that's perhaps different than a lot of scientists and yeah it's been working out well for me so far yeah I love it I can definitely sympathize too when I first started my PhD in geology I only had three undergrad courses in the earth Sciences at that point and so it was a slog it was it was a lot to catch up but um you know but for everyone out there you can make a change in your career you're never stuck in One path or One Direction uh it's always up to you where you choose to meander in your careers uh sanjoy I do want to talk a little bit about your research here while we have some time before talking a bit about the ask an astrobiologist show and its history and a bit more about you personally um and leading up to the show you and I were discussing your research and you said something that I really want to draw out here a little bit you mentioned that part of your work is quantifying the concept of habitability and I really wanna I wanna hear you in your words explain what that means to our audience and the research that you do sure yeah happy too um it's funny because my postdoc had nothing to do with my PhD I kind of like doing these things I was like oh I find a new something shiny and and you know the tools of science teach you how to solve a problem doesn't really matter what the problem is knowledge you can acquire and then solve the problems as it comes along quantifying the concept of habitability means that you essentially treat life like a light bulb so in order for a light bulb to shine you need to understand the electrical circuit that's providing energy to the bulb in the same way the environment provides energy to biology so I do the same coupling voltage and current uh from the natural environment delivered to biological systems so you can calculate um given what is dissolved in water what the voltage is for biology and it's important to talk about what's dissolved in water because Water by itself is kind of not habitable it's really the the energy that's provided by the stuff that's dissolved in water that biology can take advantage of and that gives you the voltage in terms of the current you have to think about how that material gets delivered inside a biological cell so in order to be quantitative about it I'm trying to think of the simplest cell possible that delivers that rather uptakes into the cell from the outside via simple diffusion processes but that's the most simple way to think about it because many biological cells you know have active Transporters in their cell membrane and that complicates the mathematics tremendously however diffusion you know we can also solve a diffusion equation it's it's it's a Well understood equation that can be tractable computationally so you you simulate the diffusion of stuff into the cell so in particular I'm interested in hydrogen and CO2 which are two very simple molecules that are neutral so they defeat they basically don't see the the cell membrane just diffuse right through which simplifies the math and um and and yeah so you have to also think about well at what rate do they use do they uh you know uh do the enzymes process the carbon or the hydrogen and the rates are you know it's a lot of studies on Earth that that have assessed what those rates are but thinking about astrobiology that might not necessarily operate with the same rate to kind of look at different kinds of rates the kinds of cell size because that's that affects the input of stuff in the in the cell as well and so you can make these quantitative links between between how to deliver these stuff that's dissolved in the water and had that stuff that dissolved and water gets absorbed by the by the cell so then you can say oh yeah there's this much energy in in the in the in the system you can expect a doubling time based on that energy for the cells of this much and eventually I would like to get from go from the energy of the environment to the potential biomass that it can hold working towards that but right now really focusing on the the electrical analogy of the the environment for biology awesome and so and you've done you know work on on systems here on Earth looking at this and these you know serpentinizing systems where water and rock are reacting together um but you've also then considered how this might apply to Ocean worlds as well to these oceans in places like Europa and Enceladus and these other worlds um I do know one thing about you and it said something that all of the grad students at UW and astrobiology get to do is to go on a submersible and to to learn about ocean science um I wonder if you can talk about that for us and what that experience is like yeah happy to um it was definitely not something that all grass students got to do I was very lucky um part of the astrobiology program there uh we have to do a rotation in Labs that have nothing to do with our our work so I volunteered in a thermophile lab so it was a lab of Dr John Barris who was studying um how life thrives in hot and warm and hot environments and so um amazingly um there was an opportunity to go on a cruise which is a vessel that goes to a site of hydrothermal activity and the vessel had on that first time I went had not Alvin the submersible but Jason which is the ROV the robot and that was already incredible you know in a control room and you can see the pilots operating this robot live on the sea floor and you can see these incredible vents coming out and they're sampling and everything and when that vessel came out or the when Jason came back on Deck I had to rush to the boats and grab the samples and inject everything in my test tubes that were previously prepared to see what actually grew and uh had a great experience there I was invited back the following year on another Cruise which had Alba in the summer summer school and I was talking with the pi saying you know I do a lot of communication science communication and I have a one of my message is that it's it's really powerful to go into space because of this concept called the overview effects and that kind of the realization that we're all kind of living on this tiny small blue marble together and we better cooperate if we already want to get anywhere but I didn't know how to express what it was like to be in space um so the closest city can be is actually in a submersible sitting on the ocean floor because there's like a window this thick that separates you from certain death and um I was of course on the scientific crew of the boat and so he kicks the pi um Jim Holden at UMass Amherst allowed me to be part of the crew on one dive on Alvin and so we spent eight hours on the sea floor great day to spend the day in the office and uh you know work to sample the different Vents and have to say like seeing an event in three dimensions with your own eyes as opposed to kind of 2D on a on that screen is is a whole new emotional experience the power that you feel of the of mother earth when you're down there similarly when you um I did some work in on Mount Etna where I was sitting on the creature of the volcano and the whole thing shakes like you also have this oh I respect so it was just really really powerful and so um yeah so you know spend eight hours on the sea floor collecting samples the way that crabs were waving back um just a really really incredible experience that I enjoy sharing about when I give out witch talks that's awesome um and there's so much to impact there that we can talk about I do want to come back around to this idea of like the impact of of the person who's exploring and in the environment and learning about these things but I want to come back to this idea of ocean worlds too you know like going down on the ocean floor we're learning about Earth's ocean but we're also learning about possible other oceans out there as well uh through the NASA astrobiology Twitter account which is at Nasa astrobio we asked our audience uh where they think NASA should focus our search for life and watery worlds next we gave the options of Europa Enceladus Titan or Triton of course people can always offer their own suggestions as well but of the respondents almost 50 percent a little over 45 percent said Europa is where we should Target life um do you think it's possible for a biosphere to exist in the Europa ocean uh and and if so uh can you envision what that might look like down there yeah I think it would be foolish not to think so um because our our understanding of life is very terrestrial based and if we think we're going to find earth type life elsewhere um that's good that's just hampers your imagination so chemistry is incredible the the energy that's released by water reacting with rock is is incredible that's certainly not limited to Earth so there is certainly energy on the sea floor uh of Europe and Enceladus and and there was that kind of energy on surface of Mars as well and so there's a lot of possibilities for life to have somehow uh developed whether it's flourished that I have no idea but at least develop like on Earth it seems like life developed really quickly when Earth and Mars were very similar and um you know one of the theories for the origin of life on Earth is in in Hot Springs and sorry not in Hot Springs and hydrothermal vents and so it's plausible to think that such activity exists on Europe and Enceladus and therefore this the environment that could be necessary to start those the basic chemistry uh is is prevalence in our solar system now the million dollar question is how do you go from like basic geochemical reactions to a chemical system capable of darwinian evolution that's like I have no idea but I think you need an environment that provides energy that provides perhaps different types of of settings and and so my my personal bet is I think we have better chance of finding life on on like in ancient sediments on Mars than we do on on Enceladus just because getting through that ice is going to be just a tedious work we'll get there eventually but not tomorrow um and so um yeah I think we have all the tools we need to make that discovery on on in our own solar system and I agree I think Europe that would be a fantastic place to to look for it let's not bias ourselves by what we know on Earth let's be creative let's not go into sci fi we have to do science which is rigorous based on what we know but nonetheless let's really stretch our mind to think about what uh life could look like in those worlds yeah I love it you know without imagination science takes us nowhere we need to be able to dream and think um but also apply the rigorous techniques and tools of science um you know and there's so much you said there that I could talk about for hours with you and I have in the past um it's part of why we've been friends for so long now um I do want to talk about the show and it's history and you actually gave me a good little impetus there as well you you at first set it a set of these hot springs and then corrected yourself to hydrothermal vents but indeed there are some people who think that maybe life started on the land around Hot Springs instead of in hydrothermal vents or you know that life was brought to Earth uh from rocks from Mars or from Venus um there's a lot we don't know about what life is how life functions um especially beyond Earth if life is out there and so for me part of the beauty of a show like ask an astrobiologist is that it brings together so many of us who are studying this realm that this this realm of life from so many different different angles from geochemistry and and oceanographic science atmospheric science engineering those who are applying the humanities trying to understand the spiritual aspect of our pursuit to understand the nature of life you know this is now episode 54 of ask an astrobiologist and so first I'd love for you as the original host to give a little history of the show to our audience uh and then I'd love to hear your vision of what this show has done and of your own time as a host as well yeah so the show started um as a discussion between grass students about wanting to be more involved in science communication and sharing the excitement that astrobiology is and so through mobile space we launched this initiative called Sega net which was originally a platform it was back when when social media was cool like Facebook was just starting all this stuff and so it was always also its own social media platform where people could engage um and to create the show to create like a community of enthusiasts around astrobiology so not necessarily just scientist anybody who's excited about it and we tried different things to get people excited about the show we had a mentoring program which is really valuable that kind of translated into the young scientist program at rural space and Sega net started with um sorry not saying that yeah asking astrobiologist originally was called Talk to an astrobiologist and we had no budget and so the way it was done is it was just a one way stream between the person who was interviewed on the second platform and the people including the host would engage with the with the person via chat so the person was talking and reading the questions via chat so it was it was it was it was clunky but it works like we did many many episodes like that and then um in in 2012 2013 something like that NASA approached us in wanting to support uh the activity uh with with a bit of funding with a bit of production help Mike toyan our incredible producer who's still involved got involved and brought the quality of the shows like to new heights and that's where we started having good technology to go back and forth you know like internet bandwidth was improving to the point that we could have video going back and forth and being smooth and uh it kind of grew from there you know and you got involved and and just immediately saw the talent that you have in science communication and it was time as Blue Marble space was growing my role as a business leader were changing and so it was a good time to transition the roles and you've all taken it to new stratospheric heights that I could not have myself so uh yeah it's been it's been well 10 years I think now for for uh the show which is crazy yeah it's been a wild ride and we've had some really incredible moments along the way we did ask on the NASA astrobiology Twitter account uh some about people's favorite moments in the show and we had a few responses um you know I mentioned when hiroyuki kurokawa was on and kind of enlightened me to the possibility that there could be if there ever was Life on Mars ancient Martian life on the Moon of Phobos um that could have been Blast Off the surface of Mars um we heard from people like Jen blank and Mark Skidmore about the trials and tribulations of exploring in the field and doing field astrobiology uh Morgan cable from JPL joined us uh and talked about her hobby of mountain unicycling which everyone really loved um we also had Natalie Battaglia join us uh some know her uh as an astrophysicist who's done a lot of work on our space telescopes including now James Webb Space Telescope uh one quote from Natalie when she was on the show is for me me I couldn't get interested in science until I could connect to the Wonder of it all and poetry did that for me and so for those who watched that episode you might recall that Natalie and I discussed poetry she's been involved in something called the universe in verse with Maria Popova of the marginalian um where they share science and poetry together in a night of exploration um and we have some really interesting news to share on the show today that just was announced it was just announced that the U.S Poet Laureate Ada Limon is going to create a poem that's going to go to Jupiter and to Europa on the Europa Clipper spacecraft we don't know what the message is yet she hasn't written it yet at least to our knowledge but it'll be very cool to see what that poem becomes and so maybe in the near future we'll discuss this poem and and the impact of sharing the Poetry of exploration in space through ask an astrobiologists and so there's been so much we've done in this show over time um you know from some of our bloopers like just today we had some technical issues in the show getting started um to in the past well I remember sanjoy when you were the host there was a period where we had posters on the wall behind you and there was one time this poster like came kind of like folding off the wall from behind you right during the episode um we've certainly had issues during every single episode I've I've hosted as well um that's just part of the fun of live video I suppose absolutely um yeah and you know these fun things happen and so I kind of want to change a little bit before we open it up to the audience here and just hear a little bit about your personal story um I'd love to know a little bit about your background and really what got you inspired to be involved in space in the first place at all or to be involved in engineering or science at all yeah so I definitely got interested in Exploration before I got interested in space exploration the first novel that I read ever um was Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne and I became a Jules Verne fan you know I read all of his books in mysterious island 20 000 Leagues Under the Sea five five weeks in a balloon you know of course Around the World in 80 Days and from Earth to the Moon and that really like got me thinking about like the engineering aspect of exploration that all the things you have to think about to make long Journeys and then um when I was around eight years old my parents uh offered me a little telescope and through that I saw the craters of the Moon for the first time the moons of Jupiter the rings of Saturn and he was like what is going on what is this world in the sky that had not seen before and um in whereas I grew up in Switzerland and Geneva Observatory is is fairly well known in the area and they had a group for enthusiasts to to join to go look at actual real telescope and I was by far the youngest participant there by far decades in terms of of participating in these evening shows you know and they were like late like 9 10 11 and you know when I was eight two I got tired but uh you know Mom came came with me and we I saw the bands of Jupiter for the first time and the details and it just absolutely blew my mind so I knew I was interested in space what aspects of space I don't know but I think like this murder of this interest from Jules Verne and this astronomy kind of directed me towards towards aerospace engineering my father worked for the aerospace engineering firms a lot of different factors that not necessarily kind of guided my path in in that that field and so that was not prevalent in in Switzerland aerospace engineering was not a major uh then it is now but not then and so deciding where I wanted to go I was kind of exploring of course the United States because of NASA the reputation of NASA just transcends the reputation of the United States um still today and at that time and when I was deciding what to do in terms of the university the the first Swiss astronaut uh politically it flew and of course made the headline news everywhere and I got to meet him like a few days before moving to the United States it's January 1999 he gave a talk in my Village and just wow extremely inspiring person showed pictures about him in space everything like okay this is it this is this is what I'm doing um but I've always you know kept an open eye about what interests me um I started my aerospace engineering Masters in plasma physics because I was interested in advanced space propulsion but there were difficulties in finding funding for me for my second year so I started knocking on doors and found this opportunity in in fluid dynamics and heat transfer through which I got into involved in planetary atmospheres and then how I discovered astrobiology so life is really not at all is a linear path right you stay open to what happens around you and even the postdoc only happened because I went to a seminar where my future postdoc advisor was giving a talk and I was just blown away by his presentation which had nothing to do with my PhD but nonetheless like this is fantastic and so I really followed learned and and was able to join this lab after a bit of convincing again very grateful that he took a Leap of Faith with me but we're still colleagues you know 10 years afterwards so it worked out so just you know having always I've always listened to what's exciting around me I never never felt fear towards stuff that seemed difficult because of community because of uh people I live with I work with friends you know you can do so much more with a group of people than the sum of the individual parts of the people and so that's what's also motivated me to to build this community of scientists at Blue Marble space um just because the sum of what we can do together is just extraordinary and so much more than again that we could do individually um so I'm disappearing in attention to your original question I'm sorry but hopefully they give you a feel about um kind of the path that I followed to uh to where I am today totally fine um I do want to get to our audience questions here soon we just have a slightly late start on today's episode um I do real quick before we do our faster than light segment I would love to have you tell the audience a little bit about your work in watchmaking um so I know that you've made watches that it's a it's a hobby of yours um I'd love to hear kind of what got you involved um in this kind of this side pursuit of of making watches in your spare time yeah I've really always been interested in horror some mechanical watches I don't care much for quartz watches um but mechanical watches and uh it really the hobby really took started during the pandemic I live in an apartment so I didn't have a lot of space for uh for hobby watchmaking is very small so I first started by just buying a kit and started putting it together and then I had all these Visions about how to make the kids better um so they're all stainless steel watches and then I've I found a local company in the Bay Area that industrially black oxidizes steel so I showed up with my watch cases and they're like what like come on give it a try you have nothing to lose you know I'll take the the costs fall out it doesn't work I'm just curious if it does and it did so there I got these these watch cases beautifully black oxidized I don't have the scales to build the individual gears and put them together I buy the movements already built which is good uh so it means the quality of the watches that I have are all excellent um so there are movements that are been manufactured on mass I'm no Patek Philippe right and so um but then I have a friend of mine who's a who's a she's a software engineer but she's also a an artist and she does the dials really beautiful very scaled painter who's really good at painting Birds and then based on the dial colors um I choose what kind of uh watch hands I want two hands three hands what color maybe the same color and then assemble everything together and so you know as a business leader and as a scientist my mind is all over the place during the day and sometimes I just need an ability to just refocus the Mind into a single task and watchmaking there's no way around it like if you're anxious or stressed or have your mind somewhere else the hands are just not gonna fit so it's a way it's almost meditation it's a meditative hobby essentially I think not to not think about it most of my hobbies are meditative they're just let the Mind do its thing and just focus and um it's been a joy you know to to to and then I started learning about the history of watchmaking which is very interesting as well and this is this other philosophical aspect that all the different pieces that go into a mechanical mechanical watches are just rubbish individually and we you put all these pieces together you have this intricate piece that tells the time very precisely it's kind of my wish for every organization where every person involved in the in the organization is one of those pieces and then together it just work like clockwork yeah I love it that's great the Buddha said before Enlightenment chop wood carry water after Enlightenment chalk would carry water and so for sanjoy Sam it's it's you know before Enlightenment and afterwards is to assemble the watch pieces and I love that I love it's very meditative for you um we are going to switch now to our faster than light segment I have a few quick questions each of them can be just short answers um you know 30 seconds to a minute um the very first one starts off with Enrico fermi's question so what is your favorite answer to fermi's question where are they my favorite answer is that they're watching us from above looking at us and like you guys are just not ready to be part of a community of Intergalactic species sorry keep working at it love it it's like the Star Trek right exactly we're waiting for First Contact okay so here's a really fun one and I know this one you know I'm sure you have some great advice here because you have been so involved in the careers of others if you could go back in time and visit yourself at the beginning of your career what advice would you give yourself I would say don't settle too far away from family so I left Switzerland when I was 19 to the United States for University and at 19 years old it was awesome right finally you have my own freedom to explore my own interests understand who I am what I want to do and then because of life I ended up settling in in San Francisco but now you know in my early 40s I have a little niece that I don't see very often who's growing very quickly my parents are getting old said I'm not there to take care of them and so especially during the pandemic and just with a parent that's ill it's just and the little girl that's growing and I'm not there to be the uncle that I want to be it's just it's been difficult so the advice is like yes go wherever you need to to have a fantastic education but come back closer to home to settle because family is ultimately all you have when you dissect toward the world and so for me I wish I had settled closer to him I feel that a lot I'm also very far away from family and it can be troubling another question if there is alien life out there do you think we as astrobiologists are most likely to find it first here in our solar system beyond Earth or out there amongst the exoplanets oh it's so hard you know now that James Webb is has launched most exciting telescope ever and its capabilities are just blowing everybody out of the water it's really hard to understand that they're sort of to predict I guess what it will see versus the uh the the exciting Mars missions that are ongoing and the Clipper missions of the icy moons I think it's a very fun race to keep to keep up with and who's going to detect anything first the discoveries are going to be very different and if they do make discoveries it's going to be debated forever before you know we make the conclusion that it is alien life right that's their last possible option is that it's it's alien life it's you have to go through all the different possibilities you can't see something strange be like that's aliens like no you have to be extremely methodical you know it's even if we make an interesting Discovery the process of science will have to take its place and it's going to be a probability at the end this is highly probable that it is biology versus less probable it's biology it's not gonna oh unless we have you know have a handshake or there's like a selfie of on somebody on the Mars rover um it's always going to be a little bit of a doubt and that's okay you know that's the process of science will work towards answering it so I can't predict effectively in our solar system or not just because like the instrumentation that James Webb is just deployed under upcoming missions or or for our own solar system are all extremely exciting was a really powerful instrumentation so uh I'm just I'm gonna love just reading all the papers and seeing what comes down from these missions love it okay uh last question in our fast and light segment what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind that life is even done a lot of work to understand the origin of life and we know a lot about terrestrial biology all the way back down to the last Universal common ancestor which is what 3.8 billion years ago but you know earth started having water further back in time and there's this Chasm of knowledge between I think I said before like these early geochemical reactions to this chemical system capable of darwinian evolution and and so like that blows my mind that I actually did that that that actually occurred biology is so incredibly complex how did that how did that happen just blows my mind just thinking about it right now I love it all right sanjoy now is the time for our audience q a uh to our audience who are watching live right now thank you so much for hanging out with us um I'm sorry it took so long to get to your questions but we have a bunch of them uh and so I'm very excited right now to to share some of these with you I'm going to start off with one that came in from Twitter actually before the show this one is from Dr Jim pass uh Jim has asked uh how much do you Endeavor to involve students in the social sciences and Humanities during your astrobiology public Outreach activities how important is it to increase collaboration with them oh quite like one of the questions one of the statements I make all the time when I give public talks is that the quest to understand life in the universe is is fundamental to understand who we are as humans right and the reason is as follows like if we are indeed alone in the universe that means that we are the guardians of intelligence that's ability to hold right I'm not sure we're ready for that conversely if we're not alone then what does it mean to be human right is is will it take the discovery of extraterrestrials to have Humanity see itself as humans first and foremost before a collection of of of races and uh you know if there is indeed life elsewhere the trivialities of conflict on Earth seems Seems just crazy to think about it and so like I think we're all many of us are particularly we're leaders are stuck in their own ways in seeing themselves as more important than the other than their neighbors whereas astrobiology just also teaches us that we're all we are all related completely related in fact all of us who are on this call had literal ancestors who are building the pyramids you know all of us on this call who who have seen images of of handprints on the Neolithic walls with ocher around it all of us can relate ourselves directly to these people right we're all brothers and sisters we're all connected and this realization that counts from astrobiology I think is a really important kid and I do that in my in my presentation so absolutely the social sciences have their space um I wish we could offer more uh social science projects in our in our young scientist program it'll come just a community we've been able to build so far as mainly scientists and science communicators but it'll come it's it's it's part of the discipline is it the social sciences absolutely well let's talk about um the sociology of finding alien life now uh rahu Meera on YouTube has asked uh how do you think the world and United Nations would react if discovery of life outside Earth is confirmed one day uh it's gonna be I think the emotions are going to be all over the map some people are going to be terrified some people are going to be extremely excited about it um I hope it's going to bring people together I'm realizing that um wow so we have to represent ourselves well hopefully to use to these alien species um we have to not you know load ourselves with weapons which is what Humanity has tended to do when when faced with people that did not recognize hopefully we can learn from our history and behave differently um but yeah there's no way really to predict I think it's going to be the full spectrum of emotions or what's going to be happening when we do indeed make first Contact I love it um so let's switch gears this next question comes from user tessellated on YouTube um they ask what are good strategies communicate complex research topics to the general public that can promote interest and engagement yeah it's a great question it's not easy to communicate science well um I recommend everybody who's interested in that to actually train themselves to be science communicators there are wonderful opportunities with organizations including boom mobile space but also the Ellen Elder organization to learn and uh agu American geophysical Union um and a bunch of others who give workshops on how to communicate science because you don't want to dumb it down right that's that's the meaning you want to explain it in using analogies or using excitement and and you know people might not understand everything but if they sense that it's exciting they will be excited as well I mean I'm sure you've had a class at uh in in school where the professor is just not engaged despite how exciting the topic is and if they're not engaged then you can lose excitement but if the topic talks about something esoteric but they're really into it like you're into it as well right so science communication is not just the skills of putting words together to to explain a difficult concept there's also the whole approach you take to communicating that's science and that's skills that are trainable and so um you know not everybody um well we're not born science communicators right we're you can train that and so going through these workshops um to to improve those skills is the best way to learn the methodologies to then explain more and more complex topics practice right that's how the only way you get to Carnegie Hall is practice practice absolutely him practicing work it takes work to do anything well that's right um we have another question from rahu Mira I think I'll answer this one uh we discussed earlier you told us you know that water by itself is not habitable that we're looking you know that the energetics of the systems that we have these watery systems Rahul wanted to know why we're fixated on this idea that water is essential for life um and if there's any theoretical basis for that belief um Rahul you're very right um we have thought a lot about you know water as the solvent for life and life being carbon based there is certainly other chemistry out there there are other possible solvents that a living system could potentially use and there's other possible backlog backbones for for life as well maybe it's silicon based life people have talked about um I'll throw a question back at you though and give you some homework if you don't mind um I love it if you would go out and research a little bit about water's chemistry especially things like the hydrogen bonding inside of water and why water is the solvent for Life as We Know It And the same thing for carbon as well there's actually a reason that carbons are much better backbone for Life as we know it than silicon is um so it's worth putting some of the work in yourself and exploring this topic a little bit I can say that you're right uh there are reasons to explore other possibilities but so far as far as we know life is based in water and with carbon um so song joy for you we have another question from Twitter uh from sibsunker palette uh sibsonker has asked if you have suggestions for a young aspiring spacepreneur who wants to build a youth led astrobiology and space non profit that can Empower unserved communities around the world uh just like Blue Marble space has find the people who are as excited as you to work on the project but also find people who have the skills to also do the motivation to do the drudgery part of running a business get somebody as excited about accounting get something as excited about the law how do you set up a business how what are all the different paperwork you need to file yearly to make sure that your nonprofit stays an entity right it's a lot of dedication to topics that are not necessarily exciting from a science perspective to keep a business going um it's it's a huge learning curve that I encourage you to follow if business is something that excites you but it can take you away from the science um and so be very very mindful whether starting a business is what you want to do you don't need to start a business to build a community right you only need to start a business once you need to you're doing transaction financially in order to stay you know legal but you don't need to start a business to build a community uh you can do that just with an email group or or you know however else you can think of the build community um it does it is taxing to start a business um this taxing to run a business some days are better than others in terms of the anxiety in terms of the drudgery in terms of the oh I see this form to file and as a leader of business there's nobody really you can help you solve the problem but you have to solve it yourself and that can be emotionally draining as well um however if you're able to then take a step back and see the bigger picture then that provides all the motivation the reasons why you do all this but think very carefully before you start a business that is something you want to do because there's a lot a lot of work behind it yeah indeed now one thing I do love about our show um in our audience q a we often have questions that are very targeted towards our guests sometimes we just have random questions about astrobiology and so feel free to say that you have no idea of the answers for some of these questions but uh user Laura Siana on YouTube um wants to know if you think uh life is possible on the night side of a tidally lost planet around an m class star if it'd be protected from a stellar flare if it's tightly locked on the night side then there is no sunlight that gets there and I can't see how biology would survive the cold or the lack of energy so Never Say Never biology finds a way but it's not the place I would look for first okay love it um and then we do have to speed up a little bit unfortunately I'm so sorry to our audience thank you for all these awesome questions I'm going to pick and choose a couple of them here myself we have one from um the center for of astronomical Research on Twitter at upgrade me bb1 a great username uh can studying life at extreme temperatures broaden our understanding of possible life outside of our defined Goldilocks zone or habitable zone is it best to look or is it best to look for life in Earth like exoplanets yes I mean the Goldilocks zone just means that water is liquid right and so that doesn't tell you much about anything else about biological adaptation so understanding the extremes of Life uh I think is fundamental to understanding our ability to explore locations that you wouldn't think about first um these really hot temperatures um you wouldn't you know those are only discovered in the 1970s like before we saw we thought the sea floor was Barren but no we discovered this new source of energy and biology somehow is it I think the record now is 122 degrees Celsius is for the hottest thermophiles which is crazy numbers right and so uh let's explore this parameter space in terms of not only temperature but salinity um pH uh pressure you know and what in that physical parameter space is biology capable of because their environments beyond Earth that are somewhere in that parameter space and if we can establish through scientific research that biology is possible then that opens up the scope of planets and environments that are capable of Hosting life which is which is which is fantastic fantastic um as I said I'm going to skip through a few questions here I have one from Terry Trevino on YouTube uh Terry wants to know how you think electromagnetism might have been in part in kicking off the electric Fields inside of cellular structures I have no idea love it um yeah I'm not actually sure either um you know there's there's electromagnetism you know it's kind of inherent in a lot of the the conduction of electricity it'll create a magnetic field so it's worth looking into more um how about so user Holden Faraday asks what is more likely to have Signs of Life Enceladus or Titan Enceladus or Titan um okay it has a two different worlds that are explored with different spacecraft um so Enceladus we can probe the uh exhaust from the the geysers whereas on Titan we will land on a very cold planet with liquid methane as a main cycle of of liquid um gosh those are such two different worlds I would still lean towards and sell this become biased towards my water Rock systems as providing energy I don't see life being comfortable in the cold temperatures of Titan on the surface at least in in the methane or ethane Lakes I think that's that's not a good solvent um very exciting place to explore of course and of course we should look for biology there because it's such an important question to answer whether like whether or not we're alone in the universe but I'm still leaning towards the ocean worlds uh the traditional ones of Europa and Enceladus a good question I appreciate it yeah it's a very interesting one for sure um user PIAA asks uh what do you think about the term alien uh they say it seems to me it's a very loaded term especially in this day and age uh so for you sanjoy what do you think of the word alien uh depends on its usage I agree the reason why it's loaded I mean I'm an immigrant to the United States and I was considered a non resident alien for a long time and it was a little weird because as an astrobiologist well you know it has a little bit different definition um and so you know like it's it's the usage of words to classify people will offend someone somewhere um so but you also have to use those words to express yourself and so just be conscious that sometimes people might be offended and if they are learn why and that can affect the way but it's impossible to preemptively find a word that everybody will be happy with just because we're all living in our own little world that we're not necessarily exposed to the cultures or other ways of thinking that might feel threatened by the use of the word alien or any other word that describes the population so if you find yourself being criticized by a you know learn why and maybe that changes the way you express yourself um but it's just the world we live in today seems to be very sensitive with all these different terms and and for good reasons as we're more and more aware of the historical baggage that some of those terms use but the word alien is is doesn't bother me as much as others um awesome uh thank you so much for all of your answers here to our audience who are watching um there are so many more questions I'm sorry we could not get to the mall um we did have a slightly late start in this episode um but thank you so much if you do want to ask your questions of sanjoy or myself you can find us both on Twitter sanjoy is at sanjoy Marcel on Twitter I'm at cosmobiologists you can also find the NASA astrobiology program at NASA astrobio or Sega net at sega.org on Twitter you can also search for sanjoy online you'll find a lot of great hits about him there's a really awesome interview article from NASA that they did on sanjoy fairly recently um I do want to close it out just a little bit coming back to this idea of the one flag emblem in space um you've written two papers over the years kind of around this idea you've had about community and kind of you know building this idea of our identity together in space you had one paper that was called an international symbol for the sustained exploration of space talking about this idea of having one one symbol together you had a more recent paper called common identity as a step to civilization longevity I wonder if you can speak kind of to your vision of finding that common identity together and will there be a third paper that kind of culminates any of this stuff these ideas of of having all of us kind of have our shared identity it's hard to do it in in short time but the one thing I can say is that the beauty in humanity lies in its diversity we learn so much more about ourselves about The Way We Believe by taking the time to engage with people who don't think like us believe like us or look like us and thinking as ourselves as humans first and foremost provides the opportunity to start that conversation right you need something in common usually to start a conversation with somebody that's very different than you and sometimes that's the barrier like I don't know what we have in common or know how to start a conversation but like hey look at the Earth what do you think you know that's like we both can relate so it's a conversation starter so the first paper is really emphasizing the fact that we are humans first and foremost second paper is really um emphasizing that this diversity is really important in in improving who we are as humans and I'm not sure where the third one will go but I mean as I learned to engage with people that are not like me I get new ideas on how we can come together as a society which is really really important because of all the challenges we Face environmentally and geopolitically that's wonderful we are going to close out the show now I do want to say sanjoy a special thank you to you for joining us here for ask an astrobiologist you've been a great friend a mentor a boss over the years um I'm so honored and thrilled to be part of Blue Marble space and Sega net and to be part of this show and really it's because of you and the vision that you've had um and bringing me and so many of us together and allowing us to explore our diversity and our different opinions and ideas together as an organization um you know you've done so much for for young people around the world to bring them into this and for our audience watching I know there's a lot of undergraduate and graduate students from around the world who are watching right now who want to be part of this journey um so if you do want to keep up with what we're doing in NASA astrobiology uh you can use the QR code popping up on the screen right now to sign up for the NASA astrobiology mailing list of course you can find more information about Blue Marble space and bmsis at bluemarlespace.org or at BMS is.org it's always fun to hear from all of you who watch the show and again if you do want to ask more of your questions of any of us you can find us all online in many places um and sanjoy I actually have one small request um so when you first started closing out the show for ask an astrobiologist you'd always say until next time stay curious and I stole that from you and I've been doing it for a long time I wonder since we have you back would you mind closing us out thank you so much for asking oh my gosh it's fantastic friends it's been an incredible episode please don't forget to catch us next time on ask us astrologist until then stay curious bye [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music]
