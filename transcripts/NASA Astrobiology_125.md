what stories have inspired you to want to know more about the nature of the universe so definitely science fiction I am a huge science fiction nerd if you can see the books in my bookcase you'd see about 90 of them are sci fi out of inspiration there I think it's been such a powerful tool for imagining just how weird life can get that's really kind of the only tool that we have right now that allows us to kind of Envision fully what life might be like elsewhere I had one that I just recently reread that's one of my favorites is a short story called story of your life by Ted Chung which inspired the movie arrival which is also a fantastic film it's an even better short story in my opinion so definitely sci fi but also the ocean and how weird life can get which is pushing the limits the boundaries what we think is possible in terms of shape and Physiology and how weird things can get really inspires me to think about how weird they could get elsewhere so yeah life on Earth
