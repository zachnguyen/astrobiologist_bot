[Music] in this lecture we look at how we use our powers of communication to see if there are other intelligent entities like us out in space the subject is called seti or the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in fact astronomers have recognized that seti as an acronym is a misnomer because we don't actually detect intelligence a while back i gave the example of dolphins and orcas creatures on this planet that are undoubtedly intelligent and possibly sentient with which we share the planet and yet they cannot communicate by these means so really it should be the search for extraterrestrial technology rather than the search for extraterrestrial intelligence with that in mind let's look at how astronomers approach this a little history is instructive in 1967 a young research student called jocelyn bell was working in cambridge at a radio observatory when she saw a striking thing on the strip chart of her radio detector a pulse about every 1.3 seconds rising and falling sharply and repeating like a metronome quick inspection showed that the pulse was as accurate or more accurate than the clock she was using an atomic clock this was incredibly accurate time keeping and nobody her nor her advisor nor the head of the lab could think of any astronomical entity that should pulse every second out in space so for a while they were mystified in fact as she found more of these pulsars as they became called she started to write on the strip chart lgm1 lg m2 lgm iii was a joke little green man one two and three but it said that at the time astrophysics could provide no explanation for these pulsing signals and so you were left thinking perhaps these were intelligent signals from aliens out in space it's an illustrative story of course because it was a natural astrophysical source of this radiation it was the collapsed remnant of a star a massive star that dies where the core collapses to an incredible density such that the core is an entire atomic nucleus writ large these are of course neutron stars with radio hot spots that we detect as pulsars now neutron stars had been predicted in the 1930s but even the theorists who predicted them didn't really expect they would ever be observable so when jocelyn bell and tony hewish observed pulsars in 1967 it was a shock and a surprise and so they didn't know what to conclude this is a nobel prize winning discovery but it's also a warning to us that when we think we know what a signal might be we have to be very skeptical and we think we know how aliens might communicate us we also have to be skeptical too so what can we say about seti and its history the search for extraterrestrial intelligence really the dedicated efforts have only been in the last century in the 19th century there were hypothetical ideas such as digging trenches in the sahara desert filling them with oil in geometric patterns and lighting them so they might be visible from far another idea also never executed was cutting large sections of the siberian forest into geometric shapes like a pythagoras right angle triangle as another way of representing the presence of intelligent life on earth these were just simple concepts but as radio technology evolved in the middle part of the 20th century it became possible to do an experiment and so in 1960 we have the first seti experiment project osma which was developed by frank drake about whom we'll hear later and in the mid 1980s an entire institute originally government funded now privately run was developed to do this activity all these projects are essentially doing the same thing they're looking for radio signals from deep space that might be coming from extraterrestrial intelligence civilizations there have been a few attempts at speaking or transmitting radio signals out into space to fixed stellar targets but most of the experiments are listening experiments or passive experiments why do they use radio what's special about radio waves we've already seen that electromagnetic waves are the preferred mode of communicating in any situation in space radio waves are particularly interesting however because interstellar gas and dust is always out there in space among the stars optical light cannot penetrate if we try for example to look to the center of our galaxy in the direction of sagittarius we can't see it only one in a billion photons from the galactic center reaches us at a distance of thirty thousand light years however at the center of our galaxy is a compact radio source easily detectable with a moderate sized radio telescope so radio waves and radio photons are unimpeded by gas and dust and they can travel large distances even through the densest parts of a galaxy and then easily through intergalactic space so radial waves are preferred another reason is they have relatively low energy and so in an energetic sense are cheap to produce per photon radio wavelengths are unimpeded because they are much longer than the size of any of the dust or gas particles they might encounter with the galaxy unimpeded for radio waves we can see entirely across the galaxy and to the heart of distant galaxies in a practical way most cedi is actually limited to the milky way because we're simply bringing into view hundreds of thousands or millions of stars around which there might be some civilizations the seti institute the only entity developed just to do this type of science was founded in 1984 as a non profit dedicated to researching the potential for life in the universe it doesn't just conduct radio experiments does broadly based research that we would call astrobiology in the nature and prevalence of life on earth it's likely abundance in space the nature of life in the solar system and how we might find it in their foundation statement it says the mission of the seti institute is to explore understand and explain the origin and nature of life in the universe and the evolution of intelligence the seti activity not just conducted by the seti institute but by seti operations in other countries and at other universities uses radio telescopes around the world and some study activities use our great observatories in space in the last few years there's been a new project that was originally launched by stephen hawking who died last year and yuri milner a russian industrialist who's invested 100 million dollars of private money into the seti activity this is the most thorough and comprehensive seti project yet underway and still ongoing it involves thousands of hours of observing time on dozens of radio telescopes and is the goal of observing millions literally millions of stars to listen for signals from civilizations on planets around those stars in the last few decades a second mode of doing seti has come into being and has developed quite quickly it's based on the fact that we can make pulsed lasers of enormous power terawatts even petawatts why does that matter because we imagine if other civilizations might develop radio technology then they might envy indeed develop lasers remember that a laser is ubiquitous technology on the earth every home has several lasers even if you don't know which appliances have them so lasers are present and they at their most powerful they can send pulses out into space that can reach far through space to the nearest hundreds or millions of stars the method of optical steady depends on the fact that if we pulse a laser sufficiently powerful for a sufficiently short period that laser pulse in that instant can contain as much power as the sun emits in that instance in other words if there was a civilization on an earth like planet around a sun like star and that civilization was pulsing lasers at us then for those instances of time that laser would outshine or shine as brightly as their parent star in other words we can chunk up the light signal from stars many of them in the sky and look for those additional pulses from lasers pointed at us so optical study is based on pulse communication with optical light just as radio study is based on pulsed communication with radio waves it's the same idea two different methods to do the same goal every now and then there's a surprise we don't know what to expect in seti the pulsars were not intelligent civilizations but in 2015 a citizen science paper was published describing a star with an unusual dimming pattern called tabby's star tavistar had observed a brightness dip of 22 percent remember that a jupiter like planet orbiting a sun like star only blocks one percent of its light and planets don't get much bigger than jupiter so a dip of 22 percent was a phenomenal sized exoplanet and furthermore the dimming event was not regular as it would be with a planetary orbit it wasn't regular or periodic it was a raggedy light pulse that was inexplicable in terms of transit or eclipse ideas and so this became a puzzle a mystery hypotheses are still on the table including orbiting dust cloud planets in the system that are evaporating and coming apart a debris field of stuff that never quite formed a planet and of course some people as with pulsars jumps to the conclusion that alien technology might be behind it the problem is it's hard to rule out what's going on in any definitive sense because nature is abundant with phenomena and we don't always know what the situation is in a distant part of space but we know what the implications of contact will be we can listen to the words of stephen hawking we only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet hawking put out an idea which was echoed by other scientists that the transmission experiments the speaking experiments as opposed to listening actually shouldn't be engaged in because we shouldn't advertise to aliens our existence in case they're malign we can also listen to the words of jill tarter one of the founder members of the seti institute and in fact who ellie arroway in the film contact was modeled after the search for extraterrestrial intelligence as an endeavor may in fact need to be multi multi generational before we figure out the right thing to look for this cosmic perspective is really something we need to adopt so we have to take the long view with seti human civilization is quite short our technological revolution is barely a hundred years old involving computers and travel through space so we can't imagine that communication with other entities will be a rapid thing and all of these issues particularly the large number of exoplanets projected through the galaxy raise a question framed by fermi famous physicist in 1950 in 1950 fermi was having lunch with several colleagues at the university of chicago fermi was a famous physicist who won the nobel prize for the fission he made demonstrated in a squash court at the university of chicago campus he was known by his colleagues as the pope because he was catholic but because he was considered infallible on issues of physics they were just arguing and actually joking about articles in the paper one of which was theft of garbage can lids in a suburb of chicago and the other on the next page was the sighting of ufos which was a common thing in 1950 remember roswell was a few years earlier and having joked about that fermi looked at his colleagues and said where are they well he took the joke the fact that the young people in these neighborhoods were tossing garbage can lids into the sky and some other people were thinking their ufos to make a serious point and his logic was this our civilization and technology is very young life forms with much more advanced technology would have remarkable capabilities he also knew that a very modest extrapolation of our technology even in 1950 would let us mine asteroids and moons and send probes that could create replicas of themselves and so proliferate through the galaxy at significant speeds he also knew although the data wasn't there for it at the time he said the statement that there are many likely sites for life and plenty of time for technology to develop on other planets even billions of years before the earth formed and so he asked the question where are they where is everyone the voyager probe which we talked about demonstrates an important point about interstellar communication communication is limited by the finite speed of light the voyager probe is of course traveling at a small fraction of the speed of light and so as mentioned it will take tens of millennia to reach even the nearest star system that's not a practical way to communicate but even at light speed we have to wait a long time the nearest star is four and a bit light years away and so a round trip signal takes nearly a decade so having round trip communication of a conversation takes a decade for each exchange of communication and many of the exoplanets that have been found out in space are much further away remember that the time we've had wireless communication and control of electromagnetic radiation is only about a century and that's less time than we need to communicate with many of the exoplanets and the earth like exoplanets we've found so far so the limitations on practical communication are quite extreme just because of the recentness of our capabilities the activity to search for counterparts of us intelligent communicable civilizations is called seti the search for extraterrestrial intelligence although in truth it's a search for extraterrestrial technology in particular it's a search for radio technology because we're looking for pulse radio signals from distant stars emanating from civilizations on their planets we use radio waves because they travel freely through space and penetrate large distances in space city also uses optical methods to search for pulsed laser signals of the kind that we can produce with enormous power in order to receive and send and listen to signals and have real communication this activity has to be going on sometime and it's very recent for humans to have this capability seti may not succeed simply because humans are too young with technology [Music] you
