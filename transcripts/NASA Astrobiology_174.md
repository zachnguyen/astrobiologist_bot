[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we're going to start our first talk session um I hope everyone had a good breakfast I'm putting some more announcements I realized there's probably some confusion like the Drive Lines a little crowded so feel free to eat in that Courtyard area in the morning I posted a picture I'll post that where like where more bathrooms are it's like they're all in the back there but there's also two bathrooms that are close to Surfside um but anyway Let's uh get started so our first speaker is going to be Gage Siebert from ASU [Applause] hello everyone yeah so for those you have who haven't met me yet yeah my name is Gage and I'm going to be talking about assembly Theory and in particular strings and hopefully by the end of this I will have convinced you that it is very useful for astrobiology in particular so in assembly Theory the primary quantity we're concerned with is called assembly index and it's a complexity measure that corresponds to the minimal number of joining operations that it takes to build an object so if my object is like X and I need at least three of these steps where I combine two things to make something new to get to X from some set of fundamental building blocks then we said the assembly index of X is three and so assembly index is kind of system dependent in much the same way that entropy is where for entropy I get to choose what my micro and macro states are and this influences exactly what it means and for assembly index these things that we get to choose are what our fundamental building blocks are and what the different joining operations that are allowable are and so we kind of philosophically what this thing means is that if I find some really complex object let's call it a and it has an assembly index of n and I find lots of copies of this object I can be sure that somewhere in the environment there's at least some end construction processes that exists there that memory is stored somewhere in the environment that's creating these objects and that just simply has to be true because for objects even as small as like modest size proteins there's not enough like matter on Earth to make all of them in any kind of meaningful abundance and so this approach kind of lives between two different worlds so one is like you know I might want to know the explicit physics or chemistry that's going on and know exactly how these things are actually built every time and understand those pathways but in assembly Theory we just take what's the minimal like hypothetical thing that we can't rule out as impossible and this is a massive simplification so we don't have to understand all the microphysical properties but we can still put lower bounds on how much it can take to make these objects on the other end of the spectrum it kind of varies from algorithmic information Theory where I would instead say you know something is so simple based off of how small of a program I can write that creates it in a computer language but in assembly Theory we're requiring it every step that that everything that's happening is physically possible and so strings are biologically relevant as we are all probably quite familiar with it can be encoded in like two different alphabets so I can write it in like nucleotides or in amino acids and like many other fields of physics setting strings is like studying symmetries and so this is kind of a diagram here of this top string of where different symmetric sub strings are within it and when you look at this these correspond to meaningful properties in the ways you can build it in the shortest paths so one feature I want to point out is that so in this bottom left bit here I have this one two segment that I'm doubling with itself into one two one two and we call this kind of innovation like and then it's like I have the blueprints for it and I don't need to rebuild it from scratch every time so this has a lot of really nice mathematical properties and it's a really rich subject so like this thing on the bottom looks like like ice cream with sprinkles in it but it's it's it's a some kind of weird graph which actually corresponds to like how you reconcile all these symmetries together to calculate like what the shortest build path is and it has a really nice relation to some like really classic problems in computation theory that tell us about how complicated it is to calculate these things um but much more Salient to astrobiology is thinking about uh what we could call Prime strings or I would argue also materially efficient techno signatures so the example I want to kind of describe this as is it's just a series of numbers but what would it mean in maybe a material is if I restrict myself to working with polymer chains and my alphabet size is basically how many different monomers I have access to if I want to find how do I efficiently create something that demonstrates I know how to compute a lot of different reactions then I need something that has as few symmetries in it as possible and there's actually really explicit ways to construct these things such that they have absolutely no I I can construct there's many different ways to build these strings but none of them reuse the exact same reaction twice by virtue of just what they are and that's a property introduced to these objects and this also kind of highlights the difference between this and algorithmic information Theory because like if I asked anybody to like make the next one you'd probably all get it right on the first try there's a lot of regularity in what these objects look like and so algorithmically they're not that complicated but in terms of the physical reactions you need to make them they really are so something where I see this going in the future and that what I'm really excited to do with this is have a dynamics of how life can explore the chemical space of what's possible and so the picture I want to illustrate these are not real data this is just to illustrate a point is I want to think about some space of objects and I think a good example is all the proteins that a species creates say so we take all these proteins and I want to assign distances between them all and qualitatively I mean there's an example of how to do that on the top but qualitatively what we should think of is the distance between X and Y is the number of joining operations that I need to change to go from one to the other and so things that are intuitively similar will be closer and just yeah as you might expect and so this is really useful because when we think about what we have as a generative model for like a null hypothesis like what should life be doing we know that mutations are things that really only change assembly index by one either I'm inserting some large segment that already existed and so I didn't have to build it from scratch or I'm making some really small change and in any case this is a very a change in assembly index of just one and so we have this kind of thick surface of the adjacent possible like things you can mutate into and because it's reasonable to imagine that this is happening kind of randomly we can have some kind of no model for what we expect life to look like like what's the shape of this object as it grows in time and so I like to think of it as kind of spherical but actually it's probably a little bit noisy just because it is so Random but in reality I don't think we'll really observe this because some mutations will be selected out and we'll never observe them and so the way I want to illustrate this is this you have this kind of noisy sphere on the left and you have a much noisier version of it on the right and you know if I observe this for two different things the interpretation of this is we're seeing something about like the fitness landscape like this is kind of the shadow that makes it through right so like there's lots of voids here of things that are either not functional or even hurtful to the system and by studying like the geometry of these kinds of objects and looking for the ways they scale we can learn things about the ergonicity of life meaning if I were to restart us from like early Earth times how similar would I expect the biochemistry to be today that we observe just by virtue of how many ways does it seem like there are to actually move in this plate in this space and by extension we can make inferences about just life in general and how constricted it must be and how diverse will potential alien biochemistries be so with that I'll leave you with a fractal that reminds me of the building process and I'll take any questions [Applause] so how can this be employed to sort of create a Criterion for what constitutes abiogenesis based off the assembly complexes so there is an excellent nature comes paper I want to say from 2020 that's Marshall's the first author uh where they talk about so you can do this for molecules and they find a really big disparity between what kinds of things abiotic sources can produce versus biotic and this is something that you can measure quite accurately with like Mass Spec and some other methods too and so it just for a chemical biosignature way there's a concrete I think that already exists thank you yeah hi um great talk and also just curious when you're evaluating the assembly theory is this based off of entirely the sequence or do you also account for structure I don't like protein folding or something ah yes so this is kind of embedded in like our choice of the definition of the joining operation right so like the simplest Choice doesn't count the protein folding but you can imagine that I Define the joining operations such that I allow myself to consider those like high order constructions and so yeah it's a choice of your specific instance yeah uh yeah this is very interesting I'm wondering how do you consider the starting amino acids you have because there's a lot of theories on like what amino acids were like first or like which evolved later and like are you only using the canonical ones that we have in like the current genetic code or like they're any like theoretical amino acid structures that you're exploring I'm not uh there's someone at your table who does his name's Thomas um but I to to relate it to this I think this is kind of embedded in your choice of like what the fundamental building blocks are it's like what what's your t0 any other questions for Gage okay let's go around the pause [Applause] okay and our next speaker is going to be Alex Plum here from UCSD hi there I'm Alex Plum my talk is on auto catalytic chemical ecosystems in spatial settings uh so I wanted to start with this quote from the French nationalist George cuvier I don't think it's a good definition of life but I think it captures one feature of life that's very important uh specifically this feature of Auto catalysis which I think is the central Motif for self propagation uh that we see kind of all across life and it may have been relevant in life's earliest stages so we say that a process is auto catalytic if the products of that process catalyze the process itself here I'm going to be talking about Auto catalytic Cycles where you have a sequence of reactions that form a cycle such that with every turn of the cycle you get a stoichiometric increase in the number of some set of chemicals that we'll call member chemicals you can take all of the chemicals involved in an auto catalytic cycle and partition them into food chemicals into member chemicals and into waste chemicals based on which sides of the reactions they show up in and so here's a simple example where you just have two reversible reactions you have two member chemicals M1 and M2 you have one food that's being used for both reactions and waste chemical and in principle these can be irreversible here I've drawn them as reversible and because they're reversible you can drive them in either direction if you have an abundance of food they can be driven in the productive direction that provides the stoichiometric increase in the member chemicals allowing them to self propagate but if instead you have an accumulation of waste it can kind of wind down in the other direction and you can get a stoichiometric decrease in the number of member chemicals as well so we've analogized these Auto catalytic Cycles to biological species in part because they're consuming food they're producing waste and self propagating themselves and we've demonstrated that they can exhibit logistic growth if you put them in a closed reactor some amount of food available some seed member species they can start growing and they can reach equilibrium concentrations but this isn't of great interest in an origins of Life context because life isn't out of equilibrium process so in practice we typically simulate these cycles and chemostats when you have an inflow of food from a source that drives them in the productive or autocatalytic Direction and where everything is diluted out of the system and this has two implications one it helps to offload the waste to kind of keep it from being driven in the other direction and it also provides a selective pressure so that now if the cycle doesn't replicate or propagate its member species quickly enough they'll just be diluted out of the reactor so it's not trivial that these Cycles are going to persist anymore persistence becomes a problem something that they have to kind of achieve so when you simulate these you can get time series that looks like this plot over here where you have a depletion of food through time you have logistic growth in the concentrations of member chemicals here in blue and you also have a buildup of waste you can choose to simulate them using ordinary differential equations if you're in a well mixed reactor and that assumes that you have large enough quantities that you can treat continuous concentrations of chemicals the other approach is to simulate things stochastically and in kind of the large end limit this looks very similar to The Continuous case but as you go to smaller and smaller numbers of chemicals things look a lot noisier and you can start to have more contingency in the Dynamics where you can have the stochastic loss of a single chemical or the stochastic dispersal of a single chemical in a new location changing the dynamic somewhere else and so in everything I show here I'll be taking this stochastic approach so that's all the Dynamics for a single cycle we're ultimately interested in combining different cycles and seeing how they interact ecologically so here I show the the member chemical concentrations over time or counts over time for the different Auto catalytic Cycles shown on the left here they can exhibit competitive exclusion competitive coexistence when they share a common food source they can also exhibit mutualisms wherein the food or the waste of one chemical serves as food for another Auto catalytic cycle they can also exhibit predation where in the member chemicals of one cycle serve as the food for another cycle and the Dynamics resemble those that you get in the lack of ultera equations and ecology where you can get both stable and damped oscillations predator or prey dominance or coexistence of the the predator and prey and you can also get priority effects wherein two cycles might mutually inhibit one another so that it matters if one cycle gets seated in a location first versus the other since they'll suppress the growth of the other cycle so why is this relevant to the origin of life we think that these Auto catalytic Cycles provide one of the simplest ways in the absence of needing compartments or polymer genetics to get this sort of self propagation that you see in metabolism and we think that they can provide an Avenue for the accumulation of complexity to ultimately serve as precursors or scaffolds for later stages in the origin of life so as an Avenue for kind of increasing the chemical diversity that you might need to achieve later stages and we think that you can do that by taking individual Cycles composing them through various ecological interactions and then using the sorts of avenues that we see in ecology for the accumulation of complexity so how do you accumulate complexity and ecology one way is through ecological succession wherein you have some species that lay the groundwork for others to later succeed them you can imagine this in a Chemical Context where the waste or member chemicals enable the activation of new cycles that couldn't have been activated into those first Cycles were activated you also have ideas on ecology about how to maximize biodiversity for example through the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and finally you have ideas about how spatial structure can be relevant to the accumulation of complexity in ecosystems where you have meta ecosystems and diversity among them and migration between them that allows for recombination in the formation of new ecological States so in an origins of Life context we often think about these chemical ecosystems as persisting and spatially structured environment like adsorbitive mineral surfaces moving across those surfaces where they're effectively concentrated where their diffusion is effectively lowered and those different ecosystems might interact when they interact they might annihilate they might continue to coexist they might fuse and modify one another and so we wanted to understand how these chemical ecosystems behave in space so the earlier kind of ecological time series that I showed you were all in well mixed reactors now we're going to consider these systems in space so here's an example where a cycle is seated in the center and diffuses outwards kind of spreading to new sources of food and of course we know that spatial Dynamics are important for auto catalytic chemical systems we have classic examples like the belazov zabatinska reaction it's out of equilibrium process we know that they can form stable patterns so I want to consider cases where Cycles mutually inhibit one another because getting more complex ecosystems is easy when there are mutualisms between the Cycles it's hard when you have inhibition between them and there are various ways that Cycles can inhibit one another for example you can have the waste of one cycle interfere with the food of another cycle or you can have their member species annihilate the much simpler example that I show in the bottom this is the one that I'm going to be working with in the subsequent slides so you can put these in space here I have a hexagonal lattice with chemicals reacting within each site and diffusing between sites and I'm coloring them according to the fraction of member species that belong to one of these two mutually inhibiting Cycles red for cycle a B for are blue for cycle B and with slow diffusion they stop interacting and just form these stable patches with much higher diffusion you can see one cycle starts to crowd the other out globally and we can look at this more systematically varying the diffusion of all the chemicals involved kind of gradually increasing in the low case low diffusion case you end up with pretty randomly distributed ecological outcomes and the very high case you end up with one Global winner one cycle Drive in the other extinct and you can look at the heterogeneity of chemicals across this hexagonal lattice and what we find is that in the intermediate diffusion regimes this heterogeneity is maximized and insofar as these Cycles are inhibiting one another through these reactions that might produce other chemicals that could help to provide support for the activation of future Cycles you don't have that sort of interaction in the very very low diffusion case and you also lose it in the height of each in case when one cycle is driven extinct and so this suggests that some intermediate diffusion regimes are the most favorable to uh kind of this biodiversity so to speak of these chemical ecosystems that's all with keeping these Cycles on an equal playing field where they have the same reaction kinetics and the same diffusion properties what I want to show next is when you vary the properties of these two cycles asymmetrically so I'm showing time series here on the right of both Cycles being seated in some Central site in a three by three array and they can diffuse outwards I make cycle a in Red fiercer so that it consumes food more quickly than cycle B and because of that it starts to drive cycle B extinct initially but cycle B is made faster than cycle a meaning that it can diffuse outward more quickly and access new sources of food and so despite initially being driven down it manages to dominate in these outer sites and eventually reinvade so that in the long term it ends up driving cycle a extinct and you can kind of vary these properties systematically and construct a phase diagram here I vary the relative fierceness and relative fastness of the two cycles and you find regimes in which either of the Cycles can be favored suggesting that spatial environments can select for new types of traits such as the diffusivity of these member chemicals once you put them in a spatial environment a well mixed reactor would be blind to these sorts of traits notably you can also look at other types of inhibition that don't involve explicit chemistry you can look at competition for absorption sites on Mineral surfaces and there we find very similar Dynamics and I think that this is suggestive that something like the Intermediate disturbance hypothesis might hold even for these chemical ecosystems and of course in an origins of Life context there are lots of different types of disturbances that you could have the noise of the spatially structured environment that you have different impacts and so with that I'd like to acknowledge David Baum my undergraduate advisor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and Chris campus my mentor and collaborator at the Santa Fe Institute some excellent grad students and postdocs including profile who just defended his thesis last week and some excellent undergrads that I've had the opportunity to work with including Gage actually you should be on here all right with that I'll take any questions at this time also if everyone just wants to give you know their name and affiliation and ask a question that'd be great hi my name is George schaible I'm from Montana State University and I should profess I am a microbiologist so um but that was a great talk I thought you did a good job breaking down for us uh I'm just curious when diffusion happens that's I think of it in like a three dimensional space so you're showing a lot of two dimensional right crafts so what does that look like in three dimensions yeah so I didn't do simulations in three dimensional space in part because I think the most like origins of Life relevant spatial structures are going to be these two dimensional environments I think the two dimensional environments can help to constrain kind of the effective diffusion that you would have they can concentrate chemistry lots of origins of Life theories that look at adsorptive Mineral surfaces already so we were kind of committed to that sort of scenario and here the idea of intermediate diffusion being favorable for chemical diversity I think that that's further support that that's the type of scenario that might be important I think there's a quote from Gunter washer who kind of pioneered some of these ideas that we don't build planes in the sky we build them on the ground and that's for a reason um I just to follow up with that what what kind of mineral surface would you like consider this yeah so that kind of the experimental side of my group in undergrad we um we were using pyrite surfaces um but here we're chemically agnostic and we're also agnostic to the exact type of mineral surface hi I'm Ellie I'm from CU Boulder and I was wondering so I'm mainly a lab chemist and I was curious if you had any any like personal thoughts of how you would want a chemist to do some of this work or what kind of questions you would want a lab chemist to do to help ground truth some of the modeling that you do because I work a lot of like mineral absorption and mineral facilitated chemistry and of course when we do a lot of this stuff it is an equilibrium reaction because you're kind of waiting for it to resolve to equilibrium we're basing our reactions on that so like how would you kind of design something like this or like theorize or like hope for something right so a lot of what I showed that in the well mix cases we were working with chemostats and certainly chemostats are an experimentally kind of realizable approach um there's another side to our group that looked for kind of real Auto catalytic cycles and known chemical reaction networks both biotic and abiotic and so I think one promising approach is to look at how these chemical ecosystems might explore that space where you seed with one chemical that activates maybe a single cycle or a set of cycles and then through the addition of subsequent seeds you might activate kind of new cycles and so I think there are kind of experimental approaches that can be done there and I think people in our group are continuing that okay hello we have a question from online actually so this comes from user Alex he's asking can you simulate tipping points hysteresis spatially with this method tipping points uh it's hard to ask for a clarification via Zoom okay Alex if you can hear this um please clarify your question and we'll come back to you thanks okay hi I'm Jake from UCSD um can you clarify why you used a stochastic process instead of like just a simple solving differential equations analytically yeah so you can have cases in these chemical ecosystems where there's kind of some unstable fixed point and those unstable fixed points you need some degree of stochasticity to break out of them so that's one reason if I just use deterministic simulations you could get stuck in those uh it's also the case that in ecology we're interested in lots of contingency and stochasticity and then doing lots of replicates allows you to explore all those contingent outcomes that's largely the reason okay we have time for one more question hi I'm Donna from Indiana University I'm an ecologist by training and it was really interesting to see all of those theories that I've been trained for in this context um a psychologist we abandoned intermediate disturbance hypothesis because we haven't observed in nature yeah for 20 years I was wondering if there are ways to test experimentally um what do you think about that and also activity in four tipping points I think the online person mentioned you can probably see the signals before transitions like time or took increasing time autocorrelation or coefficient of variation absolutely thank you for the question yeah so I think an ecology the intermediate disturbance hypothesis is controversial and many people have abandoned it I think in this kind of modeling context it's very easy to kind of look for it just because we're doing experiments in silico and I think that if it does hold in the biological case certainly it holds in the chemical case there's a possibility that it holds in the chemical case and not the biological case um I think the weak version of this is that there are certain types of disturbance regimes that can be beneficial for chemical diversity even if the intermediate disturbance hypothesis doesn't hold at large to the Tipping points question I think you do see sort of kind of signs in the diffusion cases I kind of vary it you end up seeing sort of power loss scaling in the patch size sort of like you would see in an icing model in physics and so the sort of theory that looks at tippling points there would also apply here thank you very much Alex okay and our next speaker is going to be mate sarka from atomkey well hello everyone first of all I'd like to thank for the organizers from having me here and I have already experienced how great this community can be I can tell that this is really a space for all so um how many of you like chemistry here in the audience quiet a few people here so um I will basically follow the logic of this quote throughout my whole presentation so probably what we're what I am doing and what we were doing is wrong but some of it might be useful in the future so um amino acids amino acids as we know basically looking for amino acids is one of the key Target for for future Institute life detection missions I'm going to talk more about the Practical side of astrobiology rather than the theory that we have heard before maybe we can get together after it and find some new solutions for the problems and situations that we've encountered during our experiments so there are three levels that we have to look at when dealing with amino acids the first is uh kind of a qualitative problem what type of amino acids can we detect and what do those tell us the second is the abundance of these amino acids so their ratios are they more similar to what things that we see here on Earth as the metabolic processes of microbes or something completely different and the third is basically what makes it a lot more interesting or puts the icing in the cake is the chirality as you well know amino acids are basically chiral meaning that they have uh they are they have two versions of the same molecule and they're non superimposable basically they're mirror images of each other they have exactly the same amount of atoms bonds but they have a totally different um structure when we're talking about the isomers and getting to know the the ratio of these amino acids is basically like a Smoking Gun evidence for life if if you like um but what does it have to do with radiation well as you all know as we said here we are experiencing the effective radiation but in the early Universe the activity might have been a lot a lot bigger than it is today and there are all sorts of theories that are some of them are quite established some of their are some of them are in the process of proving but the point is that all the um sons and stars basically produce ultraviolet light and if you have this scattered from the surface basically you have a polarized light and basically amino acids and enantiomers which are which absorb a specific light better than their counterparts then basically they get destroyed in the process this is the same way actually as we detect the the their ratio but it's also their Doom if we are talking about high intensities so this is a pretty much established model we can basically replicate these using all sorts of accelerators and all sorts of sources to basically mimic this effect the other one is is a uh um more of a still about photons but but more of a having a um the magnetic effect also taken into account when dealing with how radiation affects these molecules and the third is basically stepping towards particles and subatomic particles and how they change the isotopic ratio and through the isotopic ratio how they change basically the composition of the amino acids and having them change a chirality so these are just the main theories that we know so far that work and in our Laboratories we basically set out to mimic some of these effects the accelerator atom queue we have three of them a small middle one and a big one they are all considered small in the field of uh Nuclear Physics but for our experiments we basically used a tandem accelerator which allows a pretty quick change of ion sources so basically if you want to irradiate your sample with hydrogen and then you want to see how the same scent was affected by a heavier ion basically you can change the ions in a matter of hours or even less if you're if you're experienced so it has a lot versatility that's that's the point of having a tandem accelerator so on the image you see probably the closest thing to a real lightsaber and what you see here on the image in the top right is basically how uh hydrogen ions look like when they're extracted to air from vacuum and basically this shows the ionization of the air that that the accelerated ions are hitting so um I'm going to jump a bit to chemistry and you will connect it later but the point is that we use the technical capillary electrophoresis to basically see what radiation might have to do with the with the molecules and their chirality you see is really a very very friendly technique and it's very very simple but that's what people use that are basically saying who are experts in the field but the point is that you have a tiny capillary a tiny few silica capillary with an inner diameter let's say 50 microns and another in another diameter of let's say 400 microns and when you feel this capillary with an electrolyte then you and you apply voltage on this system basically you will see stuff migrate and they will migrate according to their hydrodynamic volume to charge ratio in this field so what it allows you to do it allows you to do to separate molecules based on the hydrodynamic volume to charge ratio and if you put a detector in the if you put a detector in the uh at the specific point of the capillary basically you can see the molecules migrating through the capillary and the specific point you get intensity versus time so you you see migrating Peaks this simulation on the left would like to show that but unfortunately it doesn't run so you have to believe me that the Peaks you're seeing are actually migrating through the detector window that we're looking at and um it is using laser induced fluorescence well uh why are we using laser induced filter since the main reason is that to achieve High sensitivity it's you can imagine it like going or being in a dark room uh sleeping and you basically just um open up or or open your phone and you have a lot of bright light coming in even though if you're doing it in the broad daylight probably you're not affected that much it allows you to remove background basically have a great big signal and to do that you need some molecules that basically have a fluorescent property meaning that you're excited them over the specific wavelength and they respond to you with a different wavelength this is a a molecule that we used to do the conjugation of our amino acids to basically enhance the selectivity and enhance separation efficiency so in order to do CE what you have to do is you have to have molecules that have a net charge other than zero and we have to make them visible this molecule here does the two things at the same time so basically um what what you see here is uh the six centimeter from the die reacting with the Mi forming a stable amide conjugate and this way basically you if you if you separate them uh you're you're getting a pretty huge resolution so what we did is basically first developed the buffer system or a background detector right the thing that you feel the capillary with to do this separation it's a pretty simple buffer it contains two components and the reason behind it was that we had to keep in mind the restrictions that a possible future Institute life detection Mission would have that you're not allowed to have a ton of regions you're not allowed to have all sorts of mixing to to happen you have to make everything simple that was the mindset that we had when we were doing the experiments and as you see we've managed to separate actually 15 amino acids chirally of the 17 that we had in mind um why is it a promising technique like just like I said suppose a few of moving Parts no power consumption easy to implement and it's just basically very very friendly technique and guys at JP are basically are developing this kind of technology and what you see here on the image is basically the base plate of this whole setup is basically the size of your laptop um so uh actually what we did during the irradiations well we made some sample holders from a drill press to kind of a modified drill press and we made 100 Micron thick pellets of uh racemic alanine and we irradiated them here you see the simulation how the protein beans would actually behave in the 100 Micron thick alanine pellet and as you see towards the end around 80 microns all the ions stop and this is actually where the most interesting things happen during an iron B analysis or or irradiation as well which you see here a bit a bit in more detail so we have the protons coming in the in the vacuum of from the accelerator and then we have a window where the protons are extracted to the air and then as they enter the the amino acids they basically lose energy and the nice thing about the ions is the that they give off all their almost all the energies right before they stop and this is actually why it's really useful during proton therapy and so we irradiated these samples with these energies to basically and we designed the system to basically stop all the ions in the sample and see how destruction or any alterations occur so moving forward basically you see that this is an expected electropherogram over D and L I mean erasmic as amino acid some of you might see that these are not exactly the same height and that is the same area this is just the control that we were using and we compared all our results to these control runs so basically with two big Peaks and we are happy and if we go further we'll be interested more in the in the small Peak part of the of the electrophilograms as we go with the irradiation and as we go with the function of those increases so what you have here is basically the control that I just showed and different doses that have reached the sample and it's apparent that some of the Peaks are clearly increasing some of them show a nice correlation um and some of these Peaks are basically coming in duplets and this is what made us think that actually although we were irradiating wrestling alanine we are basically seeing racemic products um so um we're still in the process of identifying these molecules um and in these radicals that we found but they seem to correlate well with the dose and also another interesting thing happened when we were looking at the big peaks of the uh amino acids and we were just wondering what could this mean what you see in the uh in this picture is basically as we go with the dose the the LD ratio is getting more and more hectic which means that we're not seeing it going towards one and anterior or the other but kind of mixed noisy version of the two as we go with those higher and higher so in summary basically we have put together a simple setup and measured some radicals that could form due to your radiation and we've done it in a chiral manner to basically see whether our method is capable of separating these chiral amino acids and more importantly if you think about the the next possible or the most possible places in our solar system but life could be actually there in a in a huge radiation environment so I think it's it is really necessary to basically create a library of radicals simulated here in the labs to basically make the work easier and the unload this from the scientists you will have to basically figure out how molecules are formed in these high radiation environments and what they are seeing on the the results when these instruments send back the data so basically we're trying to to establish a big Library where all sorts of amino acids mixers and single ones are irradiated or with all sorts of radiation sources and see what products are there and what can be identified using this technology so I'd like to thank you very much for your attention [Applause] foreign okay we have time for two questions for mate Chad hi uh Chad pazoriski from Georgia Tech uh I was really glad to see celif because it's a method that I work with as well and so uh seeing it being used around is is wonderful and I have a question about your chiral method which seemed to work very well um so uh did you develop this in its entirety or uh when did you develop it where basically I wanted all about the Cairo method is it published and uh yeah it's not published yet but we've developed it in collaboration with JPL basically the key thing here is that to do chiro separation the way you can imagine is is that when you have these molecules in a solution and that they migrate through the capillary if you have some additional additives in your buffer basically you can in um emphasize or or basically manipulate how these molecules behave but I mean that if you have sugars like cycle Jack strains these are circular long oligomers basically these amino acids are as they migrate they meet with these cavities and they basically form an inclusion complex they go in they go out they go in they go out and some of the Indian tumors are staying longer in this cavity and some of them are staying for a short period of time and as they migrate they basically separate and this is what we see and in this context to basically answer your question we had a lot of constraints first of all we are not allowed to have a ton of additives a ton of stuff in the buffer because an instrument has to be able to do this on its own its own so we had two components in it which is the habish or hippies I don't know how they say it in English properly AGP yes and and the other one is the md40 which is basically similar to cycle dextrins but it consists of sugar oligomers or actually monomers and as you go you have at the end at the beginning one sugar one glucose unit and as you go two three four Etc and these after some around seven they start to become helico and you have a long long longer chains of these sugars and basically it enhanced the effectiveness of this cavity movement last question hi my name is shiv agrawal from Western Michigan University so you have used protons for irradiation have you considered using leptons we know it should be done and it should be interesting but we wanted to do to use the facility that we have available and currently we are only are only able only able to do protons and heavy ions it would be a nice thing to move forward and do all sorts of experiments on this on this field as well I'm happy to collaborate second thing is have you used variable energies for protons at what energies are you we in this experiment we used only one energy we didn't want to have too many variables if it's hard enough to figure out whether with 100 Micron thickness of a palette are we able to to robustly uh do experiments and unfortunately uh with a simple system and with a great care we were able to basically make it uh work so this was the first goal that we wanted to achieve and and uh of course we have all sorts of experiments either already running or in plan to vary energies where I actually the the dose rate which is actually a much more important thing it looks like it is a key factor in some instances and also doing everything in vacuum doing everything it was in air but we also would like to do it in vacuum and also in cold temperatures as well thanks a lot all right thank you very much mate thanks very much [Applause] okay and for our next speaker we have young Hua

right everybody we're going to start the next talk session life on the edge and our first presenter is Lauren Lowe from the University of New South Wales hi everyone so I'm Lauren and I'm from Anna Lang's Lab at unsw Sydney in Australia and today I'm going to tell you a bit about the work I do on model protocells or model primitive cells so I'm sure many of us here are trying to answer the question of how did life on earth begin now I'm focusing on a very very specific point in time when life had maybe begun to transition from super simple primitive cells perhaps composed of a fatty acid bilayer membrane it's a more complex protocells or primitive cells more akin to Modern Biology at this point in time we'd started to see the emergence of phospholipids and some simple enzymes but we hadn't yet thanks but we hadn't yet seen the emergence of all the complex cellular cellular Machinery that exists in our cells so things like membrane transport mechanisms for example that transport nutrients and waste molecules out of the cell maybe they hadn't come around yet so that begs the question how are these protocells actually able to feed themselves how were they able to grow how are they able to divide so I'm trying to answer this question by building a propagating synthetic cell what that basically means is it's an artificial cell that is able to feed itself can grow it can divide and I'm trying to achieve this using the simplest components possible to try and understand how life transitioned into what we know it as today so this involves a pretty large collaboration and with my collaborator in Japan yutatsu he's been able to build a preliminary synthetic cell composed of a phospholipid bilayer membrane also known as a vesicle and this vesicle is composed of a mixture of popc and popg two types of phospholipids and within this vesicle we have a system that can be used to actually synthesize fatty acids and eventually synthesize phospholipids that can then be incorporated into the bilayer membrane actually allowing it to grow now one of the big problems with this system is that you can only encapsulate a small number of nutrients actually within the synthetic cell within the vesicle there's only room for so many molecules and if you encapsulate as many as you can you only really get one to two percent membrane growth which isn't really sustainable for a cell that we want to make grow and divide so what we really need is some sort of regular nutrient Supply so we need an external feedstock of nutrients that can actually permeate the lipid bilayer membrane so make its way from the outside of the cell into to the inside of the cell that way we can actually achieve continual membrane growth so that's my role in this project I'm trying to figure out a way that we can actually get the nutrients that we need for the synthetic cell to function to make its way across the lipid bilayer membranes the interior of the synthetic cell so in order to do that I've needed a technique that can be used to monitor solute permeability or the permeability of different nutrients and to do that I'm using what's known as a shrink soil assay basically that involves preparing vesicles encapsulating a fluorescent dye known as calcine when you mix these vesicles with your solute or your nutrient interests the difference in osmolarity actually causes the vesicles to shrink because water rapidly exits the vesicle and we kind of see this these shriveled up sort of shrunken structures and because we've had water exit the vesicles we've actually had an increase in concentration of the diet that's on the inside of these vesicles and that actually causes the fluorescent signal to decrease because calcium is a self quenching diet above certain concentrations so at high concentrations the fluorescence actually goes down rather than going up so it's a little bit counter intuitive but over time if we have a permeable solute so a solute that does actually enter the vesicle you'll start to see the vesicles slowly swell up again and it'll roughly get back to its original size and with that we have a decrease in calcium concentration so we have an increase in the fluorescence roughly to what it was to begin with and we can basically monitor that whole process using some sort of fluorimeter or something that can measure fluorescence and we can monitor the changes intensity over the time so we can see initially the intensity is somewhere up here and then with the addition of the solute the intensity drops down and then if we have a permeable solute that signal will start to recover and restart to see the original intensity kind of values there now because these intensities are kind of a direct measure of the calcium concentration we can convert concentration to volume so the plots I'll be showing you today show the changes in volume over time and it's just worth noting that the initial stage where the vesicles shrink and swivel up shrivel up actually happens very quickly and the experimental setup I currently have I can't actually see that because it just happens too fast so the data I'll be showing you is just the recovery of that volume so the basic workflow for a lot of my experiments is to First prepare the vesicles composed of an eagle mixture of popc popg in 50 millimolar happy so that's just the buffer it's roughly buffering around physiological pH and these bicycles are all encap all encapsulate that fluorescent diode calcium and then make sure all the unencapsulated calcium is removed and I mix the vesicles with the solute all the nutrient of interest and monitor the changes in fluorescence over time and then determine the changes in volume over time so this is what some of the data looks like on the left we can see some examples of some permeable solutes so our control here was the 50 millimolar happyes in the blue and all of this data is normalized to the volume of that control at time zero so we see in the blue 50mm Heavies it's just a flat line there not much is changing and that's what we'd expect it's our control it's what we made our vesicles in so we don't expect any volume change there but when we mix our vesicles with something like glucose or glycine for example so the red and the purple we see that characteristic curve telling us that the volume is actually increasing after the vesicles initially kind of shriveled up so that tells us that these two solutes are both permeable across these lipid bilayer membranes and glycine is actually more permeable than the glucose because it increases at a faster rate on that plot I also have glycerol at first glance it kind of looks like nothing happens there but glycerol is known to be super permeable across lipid bilayers so it's likely that I just actually missed that initial shrinkage and swelling stage so it just looks like nothing's happened right now because I missed the first kind of couple minutes of this process now on the other plot we have some examples of some impermeable sites and you can see there's quite a few there so a lot of the solutes I've looked at so far are quite impermeable and that's we can see that there's like those flat lines at the bottom there there's no increase in volume over time so over these this time frame none of these solutes are permeable which is kind of disappointing because a lot of these solutes would be useful nutrients for a synthetic cell things like amp ATP for energy and then something like sodium acetate I was hoping to use as a carbon source to actually synthesize fatty acids and then the phospholipids but it's not particularly surprising that a lot of these solutes were impermeable It's relatively well established in literature child that phospholipid bilayers aren't the most permeable things especially when comparing them to a fatty acid bilaya for example so fatty acid bilayers are kind of useful to think about because they have been proposed to have made up the first protocell membranes before we saw the emergence of phospholipids and we can see in this plot here for something like glucose it's a bit less permeable in phospholipids than in fatty acid bilayers for something like sodium potassium it's significantly less permeable and like over this scale that that's a really significant margin there and then for something like amp and magnesium that's not actually on the scale shown here for phospholipids so it's way less permeable in phospholipid membranes than it is in fatty acid membranes so again these results are particularly surprising but I still wanted to try and find a way to actually get these nutrients to permeate the bilayer so today I'm going to talk about a couple of different strategies I've tried to use to actually improve permeability the first of which is modifying the membrane composition so as I said all the vesicles I've been working with so far have been composed of prbc and papg now these lipids are quite nice to work with they're cylindrical in shape so they're packed together in these really nice bilayers they're very uniform but what would happen if I were to say disrupt the way the lipid molecules actually pack together what if I introduced a leopard with a different shape something like laser PC which has the single carbon chain rather than two but it still has a relatively bulky head group so it has this more conical like shape and when that gets inserted into bilayers it can cause defects to form and pores which would potentially allow nutrients to pass through the membrane so I wanted to explore what effect adding small quantities of lyso PC would have on permeability and the other lipid I looked at is oleic acid which is a fatty acid has a single carbon chain and a relatively small head group but because it's a fatty acid it has a very different properties to what phospholipids do so I wanted to explore how those different properties might affect the permeability of the membrane and generally I found that they didn't make much of a difference so first of all I prepared all the vesicles the same way I did before but added about 10 either lyso PC or oleic acid to the system and generally as I said didn't make much of a difference we have one of our example permeable solutes there so glucose which we saw was permeable earlier we can see in those three curves there isn't really much difference between them if anything the green curve the oleic acid is shifted down slightly but the shapes of the curves are all very similar which is telling us that the permeability hasn't really changed and we see something simple similar with one of the impermeable solutes that being lysine I still have all those flat lines so we saw no improvement in permeability there and this was generally the case across a lot of the different solutes or nutrients that I actually tried there weren't any marked improvements in permeability except for when I tried sodium acetate so when we had the presence of 10 a lake acid in the system we see a significant Improvement in permeability compared to what it was originally with the popcpg system and also compared to adding the 10th Cent lyso PC so we do see that curve that's telling us that the vesicle is swelling up again and we actually have the solute molecules permeating into the vesicle which is good news we saw one of these uh solutes actually kind of worked and actually were able to permeate the membrane and as I said it was great to see that it did work with sodium acetate because we wanted to use that as our carbon source for fatty acid synthesis then phospholipid synthesis and that would actually help getting the membrane to grow but as I said overall it didn't work for a lot of the stuff I tried so I wanted to try a second strategy to try and improve permeability and that was through the addition of divalent cations so in literature it's pretty well established that divalent cations also affect the packing of the way of the lipid molecules so the way the bilayers actually packed together so I wanted to see if that would make a difference to permeability and again generally I found it didn't make that much of a difference except for the presence of sodium acetate so with the 10 Lake acid system and the sodium acetate when I added magnesium chloride which is what we see in the orange there was a Improvement in permeability if we see that curve kind of increases faster than what the the blue line which is just the pure sodium acetate and the green line which is just the magnesium chloride so for whatever reason the addition of magnesium chloride with the sodium acetate and in the temps in oleic acid system did improve permeability overall but again generally I found that this was quite difficult to achieve in a lot of the solutes I tried I've also tried other divalent cations which I haven't shown here um in general it was pretty tough so what does that mean overall so generally I've found that permeability can somewhat be modulated for specific specific sites by changing the membrane composition and divalent cations can somewhat improve the permeability of specific solutes but overall it was pretty difficult to actually see any marked improvements in permeability for a lot of the different things I studied so what does that mean for origins of life well perhaps we needed protein channels to actually co evolve with phospholipid synthesis as I mentioned earlier fatty acid membranes are much more permeable than phospholipid membranes so if they were the first protocell membranes they were able to access nutrients a lot easier than phospholipid membranes on their own would be able to so we've probably needed some sort of mechanism to actually co evolve with phospholipids as they started to emerge but this is a very much an ongoing project I'm trying a lot of different membrane compositions a lot of different divalent cations and I'm still working on other methods to kind of improve permeability so hopefully in the future I'll have some more definitive results with some improvements in permeability for a lot of other solutes too so with that I'd like to acknowledge the entire Land Group and my supervisor Anna for all her support thank you to my sources of funding and thank you to everyone for listening [Applause] [Laughter] okay we have time for a few questions thank you I am from Ohio University I study in molecular biology I'm just interested in the method that you use to measure your membrane permeability is it a patch clamp electrophysiology or what so the technique I was using is well actually it's actually a measure of the changes in volume but it's reliant on the fact that with those changes in volume they can only occur because the solute is actually permeating the membrane so it's actually a fluorescence based technique so I use a fluorine fluimeter or plate radar depending on the experimental setup I have going to actually measure those changes in fluorescence over time and from that you can calculate the changes in volume which you can actually then go on to work out permeability coefficients from those curves which is something I haven't done yet but you can actually fit a model to that curve and extract the permeability coefficients as well okay I'm I'm just actually thinking that um if you can employ the patch Clump electrophysiology method it can give insight into like membrane polarity hyperpolarization yeah which can also give more insight on this yeah 100 in this a few other techniques that I've actually used as well that are quite similar to that but I I didn't show them in this presentation but I'm happy to chat about this then hi I'm Tim from University of Wisconsin Madison um I was wondering uh do you think there could be an effect of physical size or specifically surface area on the degree of permeability and if so did you like control for size did you extrude your vesicles I showed it good question yeah so these vesicles for this system I'm working with have all been extruded through 50 nanometer pause they're roughly they're probably about 40 nanometers in diameter for the most part it's a relatively even distribution added to DLS on pretty similar systems um yeah that that's why I did extrude because I would expect from the ability to be affected by the size of the vesicles thank you very much Lauren thank you [Applause] thank you okay our next speakers be jono abishir from Portland State University [Music] hello everyone my name is jono Abshire I am a second year PhD student at Portland State University working in the center for life in extreme environments more specifically out of the extreme virus lab and today I'll be giving you a little bit of insight into Life In Hell understanding the role of toxin antitoxin systems in prokaryotic genomes and their potential for virus host coevolution tldr extreme organisms the viruses that infect them and their interactions in these extreme environments and our journey kind of begins right here so this is a personal image of Lassen Volcanic National Park it is one of the many areas on our beautiful planet that is home to these volcanic Hot Springs this is one of the main sampling sites of our a lab and while most people wouldn't believe that there are things living in this environment there certainly are specifically these microbes from hell and I'll get back to these guys in just a second but a little bit of background about why we why we studied these particular environments so these volcanic Hot Springs are often considered and understood to be analogs for both for planets both outside and inside of our solar system referring back to some of the ancient Hot Springs found recently on Mars which may or may not have looked something like this boiling Mud Pot that we find in Devil's Kitchen at Lassen Volcanic National Park getting back to the microbes one such microbe is this micro right here spherical cell known as sacralobus olfactericus this is a scanning electron microscope showing you the topology of the cells um coined s441 by our lab really thrives and uh lives in these hot acidic conditions with temperatures from around 70 to 75 to 80 degrees C and ph's of around three to as low as one so these really extreme environments and when we think about these environments and the reach ecosystems that uh and habitat them we can also think about one of the most abundant molecules on the planet so that of viruses and yes there are these extreme viruses infecting these extremophiles uh the one which I work with in lab is sopholobus spindle shape virus one sacralobus is a natural host of this particular virus this ssv1 this is Stanley uses they them pronouns really characterized by his lemon shape so these shapes are really unique to both archaeal organisms extremophiles and some of these extreme viruses and when we think about looking at these organisms and the interactions between them in these extreme environments we can look at some systems currently prevalent today in bacterial cells so these toxin antitoxin systems usually known as addiction modules found on plasmids again really prevalent in bacterial genomes only recently being being discovered to have some viral encoding and what this particular system confers is when you have a plasmid that has the positive uh or is positive for that particular addiction module that cell will needs that plasmid in order to continue its life in that particular environment so here we have the presence of the TA um should that cell or progeny continue with the presence of that plasmid you would expect normal growth in the environment whereas if it were to lose that plasmid it would would have been addicted to that particular genome it would die off whereas in a negative system you would get growth either way whether or not there's plasmid loss and we can further visualize this particular mechanism by looking at what might happen to some uncolonized cells some sort of event happens in which the addiction modules introduced to that population and you have your addicted Survivor going on to make new progeny and then conferring that group protection and persistence so these systems are really understood in bacteria to confer a microbial persistence phenotype some have been referred to as fate defense mechanisms and largely considered as plasmid stabilizers on the plasmin um and we can also uh assume that another group of uncolonized cells were to come in here perhaps that group encounter you would still get that toxic culling uh from that toxin antitoxin system uh one important note they are characterized as two genes that are typically right next to each other um the toxin being just Downstream of the antitoxin uh pretty stable toxin pretty unstable antitoxin and looking at this system with ssv1 a previous student did quite a bit of work in uh mutagenesis of the ssv1 genome and we use this at least these mutants to test whether or not some of these uh genes or open reading frames are essential to the virus and two genes in particular this T3 and TX transcript these particular two genes we can make changes to what I think is the antitoxin and we don't see too much difference in terms of viral infection viral function whereas if we were to delete this or insert a sequence into this particular open reading frame what I think is the toxin we do see differences in infection mechanisms and looking at infection mechanisms of these extreme viruses and just virus reproduction overall viruses can typically go through two Pathways or a combination of both so a lytic cycle in which the viral genome the viral DNA will insert itself into the cell you have some replication going on eventually assembly of those virions and the cell will then burst die and those viruses will go on to infect other cells whereas in a lysogenic cycle the viral genome is incorporated into the host genome and there's usually a latent phase in which it kind of just stays there maybe some induction event happens in ssv's case it actually just buds from the cell without killing the cell and one of the one of the two ways that we use to test for this viral reproduction is of course PCR so amplifying a sequence that's specific to viral DNA looking for its presence in cell free supernatants another way is through Halo assay so very similar to a plaque assay in which you look where cells are bursting we cultivate a lot of cells uninfected sacroilobus cells like you saw in the slide a while back and then we spot cell free supernatants which contain these mutant viruses onto the plate and look for clearings and this Halo assay is made possible because of the fact that ssv1 buds from its cell without killing the cell um and the UN the infected cells grow quite slower so it really converts this growth stunting phenotype in the sacrolobus cell and looking at the toxin protein and large a large majority of my work has been looking at mutants that we've made in this toxin protein and several uh machine learning softwares have indicated that there's a quite a high probability of a cleavage site over here behind this very hydrophobic uh helicy right here and so I sought to characterize at least this particular mechanism in ssv1 through using some of these mutants that we already have um and while largely these over here are our wild type so really shouldn't expect any kind of change in viral function you can see some really nice Halos and we can confer that you know the cells are not dying but they're sick and in our mutants where we have insertions in in that specific toxin uh open reading frame we don't see any Halo formation um likewise I sought to substitute those two uh residues at the cleavage site since it's largely important for protein maturation protein function and we still don't see a Halo just switching those two residues but the main takeaway from this is that we still get virus replication we still get quite a bit of at least high levels of viral replication from some of these mutants and one of these mutants particular we didn't see anything so maybe that one's detrimental to that particular open reading frame but we do see that there is virus replication happening in the cell supernatant when we screen for DNA and it's important to kind of note that this this protein isn't just unique to ssv1 in in looking at these systems in these extreme organisms uh this one in particular up here is another SSV so another spindle shape virus in which we see really low sequence similarity across these particular genes but quite a hot quite a high bit of um structural similarity between these genes and a lot of these are genomes of extremophiles while some are virally encoded and uh one of the main takeaways really just wrapping uh wrapping it all back around looking for these particular mechanisms and how they confer persistence with both their extremophilic organism and their viruses would be a really nice first start in looking for these biosignatures perhaps and ways that we can look into how the microbes might be interacting in these particular extreme environments this is another sampling video um just of last in volcanic Park pretty pretty close to where s441 was isolated from uh looks pretty similar to maybe something we'd see on another planet that we could sample at and then a Shameless plug but looking for viruses in space I think is the obvious next step we know that they're the most abundant molecule in the planet and just understanding that these mechanisms and that these systems are out there allowing these cells to thrive in this particular environment would be a great uh in starter conversation for looking for these small biomolecules in space and with that I just want to thank my loud um my group over here at Boiling Springs Lake when we collected samples and my Pi uh Dr Ken Stedman thank you thank you General we have a time for about three questions hey my name is Pia and I'm really interested in like crispr costume Unity of microbes um have you looked at all into the interactions of other phage defense systems um yeah so at least in terms of uh this toxin antitoxin system they're pretty understood in bacterial cells to like incorporate themselves into the genomic crispr cas9 there are some proteins that um that look pretty similar to this a291 and some of these other virally encoded genes that do have some kind of crispr casts editing mechanism so yeah I think they it might be leaning towards that way but they're pretty well characterized in terms of like how they work with proteins and mRNA so um yeah not too far there yet but um definitely definitely somewhere in there uh thank you for the talk Marshall Seaton JPL and I I was curious so um you're talking about looking for viruses and extraterrestrial environments um do you think there would be or I'm curious I'm completely ignorant yeah no no I dropped out of Bio too so for this um for viruses specifically like would small molecule biosignature classes vary from viruses to like what you'd be looking for with cells yeah yeah I I for sure and that kind of brings me at least back to a point like of looking for fossils and stuff like that so viruses and sediment um and at least our lab there's been some work in like silica and coding viruses and how you know the stability of them so maybe there's a pretty silica Rich environment in which we might be able to look for any kind of these signatures so like proteins um or or yeah just specific things that might might have been preserved in those particular environments considering that these viruses live and thrive in in pretty extremes um you know they're they're they got to be out there at least and so you mentioned um uh looking at like morphology and fossils and things like that I know that at least for um looking at cells and things um they've been shown to to mimic abiotic systems uh pretty well because humans are very good pattern recognition and so um has anything been seen like that for viruses yeah not that not that I'm familiar with um I know it's at least a brand new conversation of starting to look for like viruses in space Astro virology things like that so uh yeah we're just kind of getting up and running oh yeah yeah no sorry I don't mean to like play 20 Questions oh no no I just thought it was cool you're totally fine thank you yeah yeah there's a there's a little cure lab that like goes on right now that I teach so I'm obviously not there but they're in spirit any other questions [Applause] our next speaker is Fatima liho from the earth Life Science Institute [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

dance so beans creeps have is a very special moment so I'm happy to share it with you and also about my PhD Journey so the link in hydrothermal veins is very important between the the ocean space Sciences since its Discovery in the 70s the efforts to study the deep ocean and these extreme environments has increased a lot in these last years also because of all the technology and all the improvements that it has been made through a study the deep sea and also not only it was an outstanding Discovery for your physicist geologists also for biology and microbiologists that we found these extreme ecosystems where we are finding these extremophiles that are high with high diversity not only microbiology but also on microbiology and in a bigger scope herothermal veins are very important for astrobiology a bigger scope is a origin of lightweight is a very important thing in our planet and also for looking um live elsewhere also thermal van systems has been proposed not only as place where these structures have uh have created or originated the molecules for the cells but also for probably there there are similar structures uh existing in the icing wounds so this is one of the biggest scope that we are studying hydrothermal dance but a in particular in this topic we are exploring what is the Gulf of California and Mexico so if you're will hit the Gulf of California we are here in Scripps out the north if you cross the border here Tijuana and Ensenada excellent tacos if you want to stay longer you can tell me but for studying the Gulf of California uh the deep ocean has been studied for over a decade and we have well they have found that there is a series of transform false um and spreading centers which have led to the discovery of hydrothermal vent systems in particular we have found here it is uh impascular Basin at South of the peninsula of the Gulf of California we have found two hydrothermaline systems I'm sorry they they moved but here the yellow dot it's called Alka and the Red Dot is called Alka was discovered in 2015 and jagma has were discovering 2018 these are the hierothermal band fields that are at a depth of 3600 meters that this is the deepest known halotemoral vein system in the Pacific Ocean where it has levels to study them as a very extreme ecosystem and we have found that the the chemistry of these harassment veins are it's very unique they are made of calcite and they have been some temperature measurements of between the 20 degrees to 100 degrees Celsius in around the 30 minutes but one of the the highest hydrothermal veins temperature goes around 300 degrees so uh one of the questions that we have one of the big questions that we have for studying this hydrothermal vein systems is who are the microbes related to the hydrothermal fluids in the sediments of the Alka and jagma Halo thermal band feels because we don't know a lot of these heart Hamilton systems so the first question was who are them um so for this an oceanic oceanographic expedition was made in 2018 about the research vessel Falcor and this research vessel has a ROV called Sebastian which is a Rover that left us submerged and with our robotic arm it had it was able to take some samples of the sediments so here you can see a little insight about how are the sediments around this hierothermal vents all the things all the white stuff that you see around is microbial mat so we collected around 30 push course sediments and all these curl samples were section um on the ship and it will stop something with um for taking DNA extraction to do poor Water Analysis back in the lab we made some iron chromatography DNA amplification of 16s some sequencing and bioinformatics and of course some statistical analysis and so here I'm going to present you some of the of the results of of this so one of I'll the questions we also have in the first place it's how are Alka and Jack Maja are compared how are these hydrothermal vein systems related because uh our contigma are like two kilometers away so we wanted to compare how much are they similar in terms of the geochemistry and all the microbiology that we have been found in so we perform this MDS analysis so if you see that we have three different locations Alka and jagmada are the Hamilton Fields but we also have a Dollar location that is called your vacuum I'm sorry for the names all the names are native words from the region so that's how we decided Well scientists have decided to to name them these both are hydrothermal vein systems but all the vacuum is a site between them but it's a death uh hydrothermal veins site so it's not active anymore so we use it as an outsider to do this test so in general terms you can see that they are very similar okay and and jagma and here is this is the outsider your vacuum that it looks um not that similar to them so they are sharing uh a lot of of things but we are exactly we don't say we don't know what if it's the geochemistry of this the microbiology so um we want to go further in to study the microbial composition of both of them and compare them and to see if they are related or what are the difference between them and one of the um a biggest surprises that we have is that the microbes are related to the hydrothermal fluids but between Alka and jagma the well the microbes are different they have we have different a film composition uh but the only uh film they share is Thermo thermostat so this is a very um interesting thing to to explore that we are finding different microbial communities between those those are thermal veins but we are they are sharing one so this is telling us about the thermophilic and hydrothermal flow is all the ambient all the the conditions extreme conditions that are around and also they tell us about all the um your Chemistry that is happening is telling us about all it's very complex I think that all the metabolism that is going on between these sediments around Harold Hamilton events so we are trying to explore furthermore about this uh group the thermo togoda that they are extremophiles they are adopted more than 50 degrees or 80 degrees Celsius so we are trying to to understand if these are like the same families that they are sharing or not that's one of the next steps for this but also the implications for astrobiology in term for a hypothermal veins is that we are ex still exploring a lot of findings on thermophilic microbial communities in this hydrothermal vein systems so try to understand the limits of Life on our Earth as it is one of the deepest points of the Pacific Ocean it is telling us a lot of information about that and also all another step for the investigation that is going on it's applying it to the icy moons with habitable habitability models where we can try to add these ecological models and now we have data to try to simulate this we have geochemistry data we have microbiology data so we can try to approach ecological model to the isomers if someone in the isemons wants to collaborate please let me know um uh well the highlights of this presentations to take away I want you to well to uh to show you some of the hydrothermal veins how the hydrothermal vent system looks like in pascular Basin but this is the first uh insight into Jack Maja ahara thermal vent field and its microbiology the first time that we have seen this our findings provide valuable insight into the deep sea biosphere and that we are learning that we there are a lot of information that still need to be processed and to know and to discover and we have uh found a diverse range of extremophiles in microbial communities right now I'm just talking about the thermophiles but we have methane oxidizers anaerobic micro microbial organisms so there are a lot of things going not in the in the tab and well knowing that the Pescadero Basin is the deepest hydrothermal ecosystem in the Pacific Ocean well it implies that we are still understanding the limits of life on Earth ambitions so with this I want to thank you please uh if you want to know a little more about the Mexican astrology Society there is a link and I am also from the astrobiology lab at UNAM and we are happy to collaborate thank you [Applause] thank you for your talk um I was just curious do you find many nanoprokaryotes like Nano archaea or like candidate Philo radiation bacteria and or do just filter them out in your analyzes somehow or like are there any interesting patterns well Ryan well we're finding uh also Archaea and bacteria well that's like the further that we have like now there is a lot still no information to to show up but there is there's a lot of things going on yeah I just remember like looking through various papers is there a lot of them a lot of those like Nano sized Clays present in the hydrogen events like Nano archiora or yeah like nanarkio or yeah is also in there yes yes sorry uh just kind of curious I I'm um so I'm a physics kind of background person of mrsd and I was wondering about temperature management so like you know above above certain temperatures like you're gonna get denatured proteins and stuff like that and I was wondering if there's extremophiles that do like that cool themselves somehow or any anything like that sorry yes uh actually well right now I'm here I'm talking again as uh with thermophiles but actually here in the hierothermal veins well not the hydrothermal vents around thermal veins all these sediments there are different changes in temperature so right now I am talking about the highest ones that we have a measure but if you go further the hydrothermal bands it drops to 2 degrees Centigrades so we are studying well it's able to study different microbial communities adapted to high temperatures but also to call call these places around any other questions for a minute hey really awesome talk this is really cool I worked with hydrothem events as an undergrad so this is like really nostalgic for me um I'm curious if anyone in your group or anyone part of the the cruise is doing it and Karen Lloyd wouldn't wouldn't like this but is doing any culturing from these environments yes like specifically I'm thinking at high pressure because these are some of the like deeper vents in the Pacific or the deepest vents in the Pacific I think you said and so I'm just curious if anyone's doing culturing and if they're including pressure in that Yes actually one of the uh here in one of the collaborations that we have is in Caltech in Victoria orphan's lab yes uh the group are making some cultural experiments with some of the different sediment cores in different sites so they are trying to to do that and they have also published one paper about culture in archaea I think so they are they are doing it but of course the challenging things about depression so they have like this tank to try to approach that yes they are trying to do cultural techniques for this any questions from up top any questions here I thank you for the talk um I have a very trivial question uh we've been having issues with sediment samples in our lab um freaking out how not to contaminate them or not being sure if they are contaminated when we are taking the samples I wonder how you control control for that yeah that's a good question so when we are working on uh on the ship um back in the lab there is a lot of possibilities that it got contaminated we will try to be as quick as possible and in clean spaces but we actually where we are working with salmon course it's moth so it gets really moved all around we try to clean but we just try to be as quick as possible one of the things that we rely on is a bioinformatic analysis so in the informatic analysis when we are processing all the 16s data the sequences we are filtering them so we have like uh we process we have also for the 16s or the DNA extractions on blanks and some control samples so we tried like if there is a sequence uh in the blank on the control we delete them so we try to filter and to make the the cleanest sequence possible as possible but yeah of course there is some contamination and we also like sometimes we see like oh that's that's not from the deep sea but we try to see the the sequences and try to clean them that's why any last questions okay thank you very much thank you okay so lunch is served in Surfside and then we'll be back for the short talk session [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] thank

my name's Sean I'm from the University of Maryland Baltimore County and today we're going to be looking at xenoamino acids a look into biochemistry as we don't know it so I'm going to fly through a lot of this because it's only a six minute talk but please come for feel free to come find me at my poster outside afterwards so my project attempts to merge Theory with experiment in order to test if a alternative amino acid set is capable of building protein structure now to do this we need to select a candidate alphabet from plausible Alternatives and from there use our collaborators over at the Charles University in Prague to build oligopeptides now I'm going to take a step back here and go over some very quick background um so all life on Earth since Lucas use the same set of 20 Alpha amino acids to construct metabolism now multiple disciplines agree that there were far more than 20 available for early evolution in the origins of life and over the last decade or so there's been theoretical work that identifies as simple but statistical profile that distinguishes life's amino acids from Alternatives and that is that the 20 amino acids used by life exhibit a non random coverage of size and hydrophobicity when we Define coverage as the range of values in a set and with how and how they how evenly they distribute across that range so what do I mean by that exactly I want you to consider a set of five amino acids and pick any physical chemical descriptor this could be size this could be volume I'm sorry uh log P this could be charge and you're going to measure them rank order them and plot them on that axis from here what we can do is we can get the intervals between each amino acid and this ties into our our idea of coverage which breaks down into two components which is range and evenness so range is simply just the sum of these intervals between each amino acid and evenness is the sample variance of these intervals now this ties back into what I said the coded 20 amino acids are statistically non random in one in about two and a half million alternative alphabets would have the same or better coverage in size and hydrophobicity now why exactly are we looking at range in evenness well range allows for a broader diversity of structures and functions and evenness allows for the best approximation of any desired physical chemistry so I like to think of it as trying to recreate a black and white painting using a defined set of tiles and you need to pick which colors you want to use to try and get that painting as close as possible now range is effectively the difference between having black and white tiles versus just different Shades of Gray and evenness is among the black and white tiles having an even distribution going from black to white now why exactly are we looking at log p and volume log p is just a measure of hydrophobicity and hydrophobic collapse is crucial for protein folding and for volume volume determines the physical space that allows for protein folding so now that we have this idea of coverage in our mind I would like to very quickly go over our workflow I'm going to skip essentially everything except that top right corner where all we're doing is we have a heuristic search protocol that searches a library of purchasable amino acids and from there we are in a constant feedback loop with our empiricist collaborators in attempting to eventually get a candidate alphabet now I'm sure you are all dying to see what one of these alphabets look like right so here we go uh this is our current alphabet now big emphasis on current um because of that iterative feedback loop this is definitely subject to change and probably will change before we start constructing oligopeptides from a set but here is our first set um this is simply just one example of around 10 to the 14 possible High coverage sets that we could pick from so there are a lot of variations that we can change and play with with the empiricists now again the goal here is to synthesize these oligopeptides from a completely non canonical set and that's hopefully what we'll be doing in a few weeks now I would like to very quickly end on a deeper note of who cares uh why would an advanced science to design an alternative amino acid set and I would like to kind of bring that question to this idea of is there such a thing as a good or bad amino acid alphabet now before the empiricists and the crowd jump out of their chairs and strangle me um yes the empiricists are saying of course there are bad amino acid sets the 20 are very good at what they do but theorists are pushing back a little bit and saying well you know Evolution can find any needle in any Haystack so I would like to believe that the the truth lies somewhere in between but what we're really trying to do here is begin to characterize good versus bad using an adaptation of 1980s behavioral thinking so optimality theory for life's amino acids now I'd like to conclude just by thanking our sponsors or I'm sorry our sponsors our funders and our collaborators over at the Charles University in Prague and if you would like to talk to me about this in much much greater depth please find me at poster 24 which is outside thank you all so much I really appreciate it [Applause] our next speakers Peter Winslow from the University of Minnesota so um my talk is in a similar vein um I'm going to try to convince you all that I can study the first proteins um and how they might have functioned so before I get to that I would like to acknowledge Matilda Newton who came out of my lab they did a lot of the work that this is all based off of so um to start off our lab is interested like I said origin of the first functional proteins so it's pretty well established by you know chemistry that you can get abiotic synthesis of amino acids right so Miller experiment we find them on meteorites this sort of subset of the 20 amino acids we use today around you know half 10 to 12. and then at some point these polymerize and you have polypeptides but they're not really functional and then um something happens and now we have proteins and then you know billions of years of evolution and we have modern 20 Amino acid based protein what I'm focused on is this this period of time where we go from random chains of polypeptides to functional proteins that are conferring some sort of Advantage right but when we look at these the the key thing is they don't have all 20 amino acids they have some sort of subset of these primordial amino acids so what what are primordial amino acids well um we're focusing on the 20 amino acids that biology uses today no Xeno amino acids unfortunately but we sort of we used a consensus of the addition of different amino acids using more than 60 different theories from many different fields mathematics chemistry biology biochemistry um and then we arbitrarily create different alphabets sort of to create time shots like snapshots of the this timeline so 2016 9 and 5. and with this we think we can answer a few big questions so can you get biological function from primordial alphabets what is the minimum alphabet needed for these proteins to function and if they do function how are they similar to Modern proteins so to investigate these questions we created with these four alphabets large libraries of completely random adiabino acid long proteins so 10 trillion random proteins in each different library and we use a screen for a really simple function ATP binding it's pretty you know ubiquitous throughout all life and we kind of just saw what we could see and believe it or not every Library actually yielded functional proteins which we were really surprised about we kind of aimed for the 20 amino acid alphabet library to be sort of positive control right because it's modern we know those work and we sort of aim for the five to be a negative control because we really did not expect those to bind ATP but they all do and actually the five performs just as well as the 20. so now we know reduced amino acid proteins they function but we don't know how especially these really reduced ones they're lacking a lot of key residues that extend ATP binders use so that's what I've been working on the last year is trying to figure out how these work and so I've been trying to characterize them structurally through x ray crystallography so if you don't know about extrater photography it's just you crystallized protein you collect diffraction data and you can extrapolate that to get electron density and then model that into a protein structure so with this we really want to look at from some of these best binders that we've found what is The Binding mechanism how similar how different it is it to Modern proteins because if it's similar that's really exciting maybe this was sort of always bound to happen and if it's different maybe that means it's sort of Frozen accident and we can see a sort of sample from a completely different sequence space and also how dependent on alphabet complexity is protein functionality which kind of goes back to the last talk so with that um I'd just like to thank everyone in my lab and our collaborators from the University of Minnesota but also from UCLA specifically Irene chin and Celia Blanco so if you have any questions see me at poster16. [Applause] our next speaker is Rudy gandalikar from the earth Life Science Institute hello everyone I'm riddhi I'm a graduate student at the Earth Life Science Institute in our study we have tried to understand scaling of protein function across the tree of life and the mechanisms that might have led to the species diversity on the tree of life right here so we study scaling using power laws and power laws are found everywhere if we consider the number of Web Hits on a web page in a given period of time or the earthquake magnitude in an area over a given period of time many natural and man made processes follow power loss so how can we help um help us how can this help us understand some Concepts in biology for that let's consider a Lego set and consider the unique pieces in relation to the total pieces in the Lego set when we plot this on a log log scale we see the larger Lego sets use more Unique Piece types but they progressively go on using lesser additional piece types so they're becoming more efficient which means the larger sets are using uh the same pieces the smaller sets are using but in more efficient and more complex ways so what we're observing in these plots is a scaling relationship and when we observe a scaling relationship we could say that maybe there's a set of rules that's sort of governing the way something is working so you as a power law equation one quantity varying as a power law of the other and when we plot this on a log log scale we get a straight line with the slope Alpha so previous Studies have shown that genes in a specific functional category scale as a power law of the total number of genes in a genome so for example transcription regulation is almost quadratically scaling which means if the genome doubles in size the genes in this specific category are going to quadruple so we have tried to include an expanded taxonomy in our study and for that we use the eggnog database so after power of fitting we saw different Trends in our data for the smaller and the larger genomes so we carried out piecewise regression to give Justice to the different patterns and scaling observed in the plots so for example we wanted to capture the slope variability for the smaller and the larger genome sizes so for example in category M which is cell wall and cell membrane proteins um so the x axis has the total protein annotations and the y axis has the category annotations for that specific category so for the smaller genomes we can see the proteins are scaling fast which means as the genome size is increasing they are incorporating um more and more proteins faster than the larger genomes because after a statistically detected breakpoint the scaling slows down and we can see a similar Trend in category tree category T so we saw this trend in most of the breakpoints that that were supported in bacteria interestingly we observed an opposite Trend in archaea the scaling is slow in the start but fastens up after the statistically detected breakpoint so a lot of categories were common between archaea and bacteria um but there were some categories that were exclusively present either in archaeon bacteria and it's also interesting to observe these differences in scaling pattern before and after the break point in Ikea and bacteria so we thought maybe these differences in scaling patterns were caused by phyla specific scaling so we broke these domains down into specific phyla and found great variation in all the phyla for all the categories so for example we have category 8 here which is coenzyme transport proteins um which also happens to be the most variable across all the phyla so we thought maybe this file a specific scaling is causing the positioning of the breakpoints that we observed previously um so I place these breakpoints on the total protein annotations to see if there's any specific pattern but we can see these individual phyla are spanning the breakpoints and there is no specific preference of for the break the Filas to be present either on either sides of the breakpoints so maybe taxonomy is not causing the positioning of these breakpoints and maybe there are some other factors like physiological or environmental factors that are causing these fake points so we were also interested in these groups CPR and d pan uh so these groups have extremely small genomes and they lack um major metabolic pathways so we compared them with um eukaryotes unicellular eukaryotes and Asgard alkia so for some categories we can see the scaling is very similar for category o but for some categories the scaling is very different like in category C which goes on to show there are different ways in which an organism can adapt while growing in their genome sizes um I've just discussed a few key results in my uh talk so if you want to discuss I would be interested please come by and stop at panel two for the poster thank you foreign [Applause] ly from the University Montana State University okay so we're gonna shift gears a little bit here and so my project largely focuses on the evolution of multicellularity uh in bacteria specifically so titled here cellular differentiation within an obligate multicellular bacteria so where I like to start is just generally when we think about the evolution of life on Earth we can kind of think of it as an increase in complexity as as life continued to evolve and this is yes and over Simplicity but thinking of it as molecules coming together to form a first cell and eventually getting a multi cellular organism and then some something that looks like the life that we have on Earth today if we look at our classic uh Tree of Life where we have different domains of the bacteria the archae and the eukaryotes generally we tend to think of all the multicellular life forms belonging to the Eukarya and we think of the bacteria and archae as these simple single celled organisms um if we look at uh the Tree of Life as we know it today uh multicellularity actually it can be plotted across the entire uh tree of life and so what I'm showing here is the aggregative uh evolution of multicellularity or a clonal uh evolution of multicellularity and we see it present in the bacteria the archaea and the Eukarya of course and so just focusing in on some bacteria that are capable of this these are just some micrographs showing different cyanobacteria that are in those chains up there in the upper left and then mixopox mixobacteria that sporolate an archaea called methanosarcina another example is this uh bacteria called cable bacteria that form these long centimeter long filaments and can actually move electrons along that so the organism that I study is called multicellular magnetotactic bacteria or MMB for short because I just don't want to say that the whole talk and so this is what they look like where we have a TM image sewing where these cells are grouped together in this kind of soccer ball shape or football shape and then here in the lower half just an sem showing you what that structure looks like so I built a cartoon kind of showing what this Ultra structure looks like and one of the things I want to point out that pertains the name is this magnetotaxis and so they make these uh organelles inside the cells called magnetosomes where they synthesize a Paramount or ferromagnetic mineral that allows them to sense Earth's geomagnetic poles and then they can taxi in the water column or the sediment column um they also have these carbon or energy storage granules inside them this acellular Center so it's just one layer of cells surrounding this acellular Center and then these actin like filaments that seem to have some something to do with their structure and morphology um I've referred to them as obligate multicellular organisms and this is rare in bacteria in fact the only example where the hypothesized life cycle is that they grow in size and then the entire consortia divides and so we don't typically see this in bacteria where typically we see this this facultative multicellularity so they can be a multicellular but they can also exist as a single cell that's true for all the examples I showed you with the tree life so here's just an image of uh one of the MMB from my sample site and kind of what we think it looks like uh MMB dividing into possibly three I also mentioned moment of truth if the video works um that they're magnetactic oh let me see if I can get this to work no now I'm just hitting buttons Okay cool so what we have here is a uh tube with the MMB in the bottom of it and then a magnetic stir bar next to it and if you just watch it you can see them swim up out of the bottom of that tube and they taxi towards the the stir bar these ones are going towards the magnetic north here in on the right is a hanging water droplet just on a coverslip and there's a magnet to the right and then what I've done is just move that magnet turns around they start taxing the in the opposite direction so that's the just showing their magnetotaxis it helps when we think of multicellularity to have some criteria for what that is and so just a list of these would be built from several cells of the same species a specific shape and organization and synchronized growth so that would exclude things like cancer no competition between the cells coordinated behavior in response to external or internal stimuli existence of cell to cell signaling and then this last one that's kind of like the catch all metabolic differentiation or a division of labor so with my organism they fit these first four and these second the last two are what we're kind of looking into one of the things we found with our project was that the these MMB are not actually clonal and how we did this was we sorted whole consortias did multiple displacement amplifications so we Amplified their entire genome and sequenced that and we were able to map reads to the longest read the best assembly there and look at these single nucleotide polymorphism differences and what we found was that they have compared to controls which is a pseudomonas control as well as other environmental coords they have this much higher single nucleotide polymorphism rate than than what we see with other organisms which was kind of a surprise and we're still scratching our heads about this and that equates to 20 to 100 nucleotide polymorphisms in the genome and their genomes are about eight megabases which is about double that of E coli another thing that we looked into was this metabolic differentiation or this division of labor and this was done by doing stable isotope incubations where we incubated them in the presence of these 13c or deuterium oxide um chemicals and then we use a nanosecondary ion Mass spectroscopy to look at those and map that back where we found in the lower left where is the 13c image differences in the use of that substrate indicating this division of labor that we suspected so with that just to kind of give conclusions and takeaways the m and b are the only known obligate multicellular bacteria that we know of yet they are not clonal and do not conform to these canonical ideas of what multicellular multicellularity is where we typically have this clonal development from where one cell divides into daughter cells that stick together or this aggregative multicellularity and they seem to fall somewhere in the middle there they also engage in a division of labor as we were looking at with the metabolic differentiation and then of course just to think the lab and all the collaborators that help us with that thank you our next speaker is Claire elbon from the Georgia Institute of Technology um I'm Claire and so I'm going to talk a little bit about respiration oxygen sensing um and this idea that there might be a really close relative to the ancestor of protomitochondria in modern oxygen minimum zones um so I think a lot of people here are familiar with eukaryogenesis it's this idea that an archaea and a bacteria a very long time ago decided to be best friends forever and now we're here um so there's lots of different hypotheses over how this might have happened um and kind of the main point I want to make here is that one there's always a bacterial host and that's generally thought of as an alpha proteobacteria um and there's also a lot of or has been a lot of talk historically about is this obligately aerobic does it have to have oxygen is it facultatively aerobic where it could use oxygen or not or is it kind of um an anaerobic partnership that turned into aerobic partnership so a lot of more quantitative Recent research so kind of this triangulation method suggests that this new clade of marine Alpha proteobacteria from marine oxiclines and these are really related to a group called ioditomonas This is an iodide using bacteria might be the closest living relative to protomitochondria and so like I said Alpha proteobacteria for a while have been thought of as that sort of bacterial component of eukaryogenesis and what I'm going to showing you really quick right here is that these are some anaerobic traits that are thought of really essential when you're looking at the criteria for this ancestor and so most of these are alpha proteobacteria and when we're looking at the heat map what we want to focus on is this green highlighted here that's this new clade so they hit all of these criteria for anaerobic traits when we're thinking about this protomitochondria and then when we're thinking more about the aerobic side of this these facultative aerobics we want to think about the terminal electron chain so what's interesting is that this is comprised of four complexes and these complexes actually have this really phenomenal history of the evolution of respiration inside of it so from complex one to complex four we can kind of track as the Earth went from anoxic to the great oxidation event to kind of what we experience now and so I'm really looking more at complex four because um within it um this is that last step that important reduction step so if we're thinking about protomitochondria they would need to have this complex for so that can be divided up even more into this a to c family we have an A type lots of oxygen we don't have to bind it super well it's there but the sea family is thought of these as the oldest terminal or complex four of the terminal electron chain and that's because it's capable of binding oxygen at very very low levels so for this new clade I had two main questions looking at sort of data mining which is what kind of genes do they have for respiration is it um entirely aerobic or is there anaerobic as well are they able to sense oxygen and are they moving along gradients and in response to that and then on top of that are these genes actually being transcribed so I did a lot of data mining in the uh with this nice big data set from the sandwich Inlet that's in British Columbia it's a seasonally hypoxic area but it's an oxygen minimum Zone and that just means that very quickly we'll lose oxygen very high up in the water column and it's you can see how like seasonally variable it is but overall there's a pretty dramatic drop in oxygen and so the two really interesting points I saw was one there are c type aerobic oxidases associated with this Alpha Pro nucleate Alpha proteobacteria and its transcription or the amount that it was being used potentially increased Into the anoxic Depths and that there are two chemotaxis proteins so that's an aerotaxis protein maybe maybe not it might be responding to something else um they were both being transcribed really highly into these anoxic depths um so my main takeaway is we should look at omz's more we're thinking about protomitochondria because there are some really interesting Alphas there that only exist right now as metagenomic assembled genomes um and it would be really interesting to really look at the full genomic uh capabilities of them um so I'd like to thank the glass Lab at Georgia Tech um my funding the NSF grad and then the oceans across space and time team [Applause] our next speaker is Marisa mayor from NASA Ames hi there okay um hi I'm Marissa I'm a postdoc currently at NASA Ames Research Center and I work on microbial sources of hopeenoid lipid biomarkers and different hot spring environments uh today I'm going to be excitedly sharing with you some new potential microbial sources of two and three methylhopenoids that we were able to find in some of our anoxic acidic and sulfitic hydrothermal Springs I want to acknowledge my funding sources which is oriu NPP program National Park Service NASA and finally Stanford University because some of this research was done back my PhD as well um so yeah you might be wondering if you are an astronomer or anyone but a lipid chemist what are hopeenoids and what do they teach us in modern environments why should we care so opinoids are cyclic triterpenoid membrane lipids so they're complex they're a little bit different from some of the phospholipid membranes we've been seeing today hopeenoids are some of the most abundant bacterial lipid biomarkers on Earth so they're very worthy of studying they are important geologically they can withstand the lithification process and all the diagenetic forces that happen when you are becoming a fossil and so they're actually one of the few really strong sources through deep time of microbial inputs into the Rock record and they can be detected billions of years after a deposition um finally in modern acidic Springs we observe methylated hopeenoids oh sorry in in this work we in modern acidic Springs observed methylated hofenoids and we found these in an anoxic environment where no cyanobacteria and no methanotrophs were present these are kind of the typified known producers of these kinds of biomarkers so it was exciting to find them at all and yeah the work that once we found those methylated hopeenoids and the follow up work was able to lead to discovery of some new potential Source organisms for these lipid biomarkers which if you are a biomarker nerd is always exciting and it's ever expanding so yeah this kind of new evidence of source organisms is important because uh these yeah kind of inoxic environments and knowing about them and the microbes that live in them today can have implications for us to reinterpret uh the sedimentary rock record on Earth but also potentially on mars or on other planets where we have a sedimentary rock record so my samples were taken in two sites one is in Yellowstone National Park and one is in Lassen Volcanic National Park in both Springs you can see the mat is kind of similar there's a purple layer there's a like a acidic algae layer and then there's this white flocculent Elemental sulfur on top that's from the actual hydrothermal system itself so what I did is I go into these Springs and I take samples and I go back to my lab and I extract for both DNA and for lipids and then from there I analyzed them so I found a bunch of different hopeenoids so I did a lcms analysis on them and so I was able to actually look at the functionalized extended hopeenoids and so as you can see there's a lot of colors on that graph every color is a different type of Hope noid uh that was able to find in my Springs the green overlay on some of them and the pink overlays on some of them indicate a 2 methyl for green or a three methyl for pink so we found a huge diversity of methylated um yeah methylated hopeenoid compounds over to the far right you can see my controls we had pretty low diversity of methylated compounds so it was really interesting in the environmental samples to see so many different kinds which is what sent us on our DNA work um so the first thing that we did was do sixness amplicon analysis of our extracted DNA in that we didn't see any obvious sources or classical sources of those methylated hopenoids which was pretty exciting so that then led us to go back and then do some metagenomics and then when we were able to analyze that metagenomic data we saw many potential sources um of Novel yeah 2 methylhopenoid producers mostly anaerobic water and soil dwelling microbes but way more sources than are currently understood and this is just from looking in two hot springs so a case for doing field work to expand our knowledge in the lab we also saw a ton of potential novel sources of three methylhopenoids these were also so these were mostly anaerobic and acidic environment dwellers that we found them tagging against and yeah it was pretty exciting so if you want to know more about either lipids or DNA analyzes or a microbial Ecology of these acidic Springs please come check out my poster later and find me I'll be at board 22 at this next session and also because I am in a room full of early career researchers I coordinate a division seminar at NASA Ames and we would love to hear you guys give talks so if you would like to give a talk at NASA Ames at any point please come find me at my poster and I'd love to write your information down and we would love to have you give a talk so Network friendly [Applause] [Music] [Applause] our next speaker is Colin Robinson from Brigham Young University hi everyone so I'll be talking about Martian metabolism and biotic perchlorate reduction in Mars analog environments on Earth so uh since the discovery of let's see if I can get this video since the discovery of perchlorate on Mars by the Phoenix Lander in 2008 it's been a compound of interest on the red planet this is due to its high oxidative potential on par with oxygen which means that it's a potential energy source for life on the red planet uh on Mars it's ubiquitous in Martian regolith reaching concentrations of 0.5 weight percentage on Earth there are microbes that reduce perchlorate in place of oxygen and Metabolism using it to drive the electron transport chain and perchlorate accumulates in Mars analog systems on Earth such as the Atacama Desert where it reaches concentrations up to 0.18 percent as well as the Antarctic dry valleys where it reaches concentrations up to .0038 these are Mars analog systems that are incredibly dry and accumulate perchlorate via atmospheric deposition over long time scales and uh there are likely at looking at these systems it seems reasonable that reducing microbes might evolve and persist in these types of environments however the model organisms that we use to study biotic perchlorate reduction don't come from Mars analog environments they come from the Potomac River in Washington DC where there's very little to no natural perchlorate that accumulates all the pakori that we do find here is um is waste from Munitions factories that gets dumped into the river so how did perchlorate reducing microbes arrive in this type of environment if they likely didn't evolve here due to the lack of perchloride well we know that the perchlorate reduction genomic island is widely spread via horizontal Gene transfer we know this because when we look at reducing organisms uh can you see my mouse yeah there we go um the elements required for biotic report reduction the genes that are required for court reduction um share a lot of homology between the genes but where the genes are situated in the genome is very diverse depending on the organism that you're looking at so it's a very chimeric metabolism so if we look here the the bright green that's chloride dismutates and this long dark green that's perchlorate reductase they're always kind of in different configurations in relation to each other in uh in the genomic Island and that's because these individual elements are getting passed uh individually and um independently of one another via horizontal Gene transfer so you only get reducing microbes when these elements come together in the same organism so my research question was did canonical biotic reduction arise in these Mars analog environments like the Atacama Desert or Antarctic dry valleys and then disperse around the world via acellular and microbial dispersal so in order to test that I selected metagenomes from sites around the world the metagenome for those of you who don't know is basically all the DNA in a sample it comes in little 20 base pair of chunks and you have to piece them together like a puzzle and then pick out the puzzles that you're interested in that maybe make a picture you're interested in and then uh and then analyze those independent of the rest of the metagenome so basically what I did is I selected metagenomes from sites around the world I analyzed the presence of reduction genes so basically build the little puzzles and then pulled out the the ones that made reducing genes and then I calculated the phylogenetic diversity of those genes at each site this is a study that has really up until this point been done only in humans which is this uh type of analysis where we look at diversity of a species or a gene to determine the likely places where it's persisted the longest that's how we know that humans come out of Africa is because most of our phylogenetic diversity can be accounted for in Africa so when I did this uh so this is for chloride dismutase a gene that's involved in perchlorate reduction I found the highest diversity to be in uh in the Antarctic dry Valley so what we're seeing here is these bars are are a scale that's Faith's phylogenetic diversity zero is basically zero diversity and then up to 50 would would be the maximum amount of diversity in these genes that we see and each of these blue dots is a separate metagenome um as you can see there's a little bit of sampling bias because in the anterior dry valleys or Atacama Desert we have a lot more sampling there's a lot more research that happens in these sites we've got a lot more metagenomes that I can analyze whereas if I look at other Mars analog sites like the Namib Desert there are quite a few less or in South Australian desert uh much less access to that kind of data when I looked at procore reductase another Gene involved in biotic reduction we also see that it is it reaches highest levels in the Antarctic dry valleys so that basically indicates that these genes have persisted the longest in in these in this in these in these Mars analog ecosystems supporting the claim that these may have evolved and persisted in those Mars analog systems so some conclusions for court reduction genes are present and diverse in Mars analog systems that's really awesome right before we didn't even know if they could persist in Wars analog systems but it looks like they both evolve and persist there for long time scales this metabolism may have evolved in these environments and then uh prior to dispersing around the world via acellular and microbial dispersal and studying for core reducing organisms in Mars analog environments can give us further insight into how life may persist on the red planet when we're studying life forms that do metabolisms like what we expect to find on Mars we shouldn't be looking at organisms that come out of the Potomac River we should be looking at at organisms in these Mars analog systems so I'd like to hear some some people I'd like to thank so my funding which is the the NSF grant for long term ecological research at McMurdo Station uh my department at Brigham Young University as well as the help and advice of Dr John Coates at UC Berkeley Dr Kendall Kendall Lynch at the lunar and planetary Institute and Dr Jennifer glass at Georgia Tech so thank you [Applause] and our last speaker is seleth Pandey from GPL hello everyone I am Siddharth from jet propulsion laboratory and I'm here to talk about the work that I started before joining JPL um in India and for those of you in the audience who are currently involved or plan to do work in different parts of the world where astrobiology has huge potential and significance hopefully with some of my experience you'll be able to take things forward so first of all a little bit about myself so I'm originally from India and before joining JPL um I have an engineering background and my current work is actually on Enceladus on Sample collection Technologies but unfortunately today I'm not going to be talking about that this is primarily going to be focused on that but just giving a heads up people can find me after the talk and maybe we can chat um but here here is why we focused on India well first and foremost as a country India has one of the largest student populations as some of you might be aware every year we've got several thousands of students graduating in science and engineering and on a daily basis we get inquiries about how do you study and how do you work in astrobiology so there's a huge supply and demand problem and there's little to no formal education or you know career prospects in the country so that was the first and foremost no brainer reason secondly I would like to really promote the fact that we have an amazing diversity of high value science analogs and these are places where some of you might actually find some of your work to be super relevant so with this in mind these sites are not even on the atlas of astrobiology sites that the community normally works in and lastly our National Space Agency Indian space research organization is finally reaching a point to to involve astrobiology as an important science priority for its future missions it had the Mars Orbiter mission in 2014 currently there are it's under Works to work on a Surface mission that would work on the progress and the success of the lunar mission that will be launching in a month from now and finally there is the gaganyan program which is the human space program which will have astronauts working in low earth orbit so that's with that as the basic motivation of why we decided to do this seven years ago let me talk quickly about the background in terms of what astrobiology was happening before we kind of stepped in so the earliest what we could find is between 97 to 2005 Israel was involved in scientific balloon experiments where they were basically working on collecting and understanding microbes in the stratosphere um cut to 2015 whereas a grad student I got an opportunity to go on an astrobiology expedition to New Zealand and along with a few other Indian and Indian origin researchers we decided to bring the program to India and that's what we did as part of the NASA spacer down India Expedition that was the first time that a dedicated astrobiology expedition was taking place Gathering and bringing together researchers in the country and that's where ball just really started rolling the momentum started building up and let me tell you something that working and socializing with people in uncomfortable dry desert environments is way better than inside an air conditioned classroom with experience so some of the things that led from that was the establishment of a standard of Excellence in astrobiology at Amity University Mumbai which was the first dedicated Center that I was a part of leading and also as part of Blue Marble space the organization that I had been affiliated with the astrobiology India group has been active since then working to promote coordination activities between domestic researchers in the country so we've been having National level meetings and discussions and what we want to do from here is move forward towards setting up a national astrobiology program closely in support with the Indian government I don't have enough time but I'll try to do justice to this slide our efforts at the center focused on three main verticals the microgravity research we built plant based plant growth observation experiments for ISRO we worked on characterizing some of the sites in ladakh which is an early Mars analog and Hardware testing for Rovers and in collaboration with UC Berkeley the Berkeley City Research Center we had four research fellows who were working to use um radio telescope data from gmrt which is a array facility there to set up a city pipeline and our research work has culminated into the university finally agreeing to have a master's program that is dedicated for astrology and science students so hopefully this year onwards we'll have students in India who'll have that opportunity to study there um Blue Marble space has been a great source of information and help and network so those of you are not affiliated I would say strongly recommended do consider it quickly talking about some of the unique aspects of Astral biology in India I've just highlighted some of the main sites here in ladakh up north which is a high altitude code dry desert environment Kutch which is one of the largest salt flats in the world the only accessible Basalt impact Creator in loner the basalt traps and Limestone caves and there are several others and because we don't have a National astrobiology Institute yet there have been institutions that have been mushrooming over the last few decades and I've been very successful and fortunate to be part of several senior earth scientists to work towards setting this up and it's only because of these people who you're seeing on the screen over here that we're able to do this and we've been working through the pandemic to make this happen they've been a working group several working groups that have been put in place uh we've been closely following work done in Europe and at uh in the United States through the NASA Astra Biology Institute to help form these working groups and these are some names in some areas where you know people have been working and too much information bad slide I know but I just wanted to tell you that there are these sites and we have been trying to map out the science objectives the different Technologies what worlds are they analog to and what kind of missions would they be able to support into the future um some other ways in which we have been contributing we published our first advocacy paper in new space Journal uh talking about the importance of astrobiology for India and internally we have been contributing to the science roadmap for ISRO as well now three main wins for us one is the fact that we've got several students who have gone through our uh system and these are the people who in the future will be taking the light forward this year ISRO published its space policy document and we were very happy to see that they have acknowledged the importance of estrobiology because they've mentioned that they will be looking into extraterrestrial habitability so for us as a country this is a huge win that finally ISRO has acknowledged us and the fact that there is now comprehensive I would say not enough but still comprehensive diversification of funding for scientists in the country to do this but definitely more work needs to be done and more funding needs to be put together so my last slide um to summarize some of these things if you are in your region or country interested in setting things up the first and foremost step is to bring early and mid career people together and encourage conversations to take place at a domestic level at the same time leveraging International work and like I said field workshops are amazing for team building finding an important University or a host institution is critical because if you're doing events logistically speaking it's important to find an organization that will support you and beware of non scientific and exploitative groups in the in the in the region finally convene workshops identify research interests try to tiler them together into overarching themes and help the group formalize themselves in the form of virtual Network a non profit or a society and finally encourage the group members to work closely with their government for their astrology goals so that's my time and you hope you can find me and those of you are interested can talk more on this thank you [Applause] okay so that concludes the first short talk session so we're going to start our poster session now be sure to find all the speakers and others um you know to talk to them at their posters just a couple housekeeping things our friends defense party is happening in Surfside right now so we've moved a lot of snacks and coffee and all that just outside in the courtyard so if you have a couple things that you really need to grab from Surfside just do it quickly and quietly I think they're showing up at 1 30 but for the next couple hours like really we're just gonna be in the Forum we can go outside on the green space but let's just make sure that they can celebrate and serve side and then one thing with with trash we need to I guess we can't put too much trash in there because I guess UCSD catering usually takes care of that so we've been told to just we'll put out some other garbage cans but just refrain from using those as much as possible uh yeah that's all thanks everyone [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music]

day and our first speaker will be Emily Paris from Stanford University [Applause] hi everyone I'm Emily and I'm a PhD candidate in the dica slab at Stanford University and I studied the limits of life in hyper saline environments so as we all probably know Brian's are one of the targets for a life detection mission to other ocean worlds including Europa and Enceladus and even past ocean worlds like Mars and so by understanding the limits of salty life on Earth we can understand how and where to look for life on these other places one of the ways we can assess a brine environment is through this measurement called water activity and water activity depends on vapor pressure but you can think of it about as how many water molecules are available to a cell in solution so on the left is an image of what pure water would be this is where all the water molecules are free to become Vapor move about the cabin that would be a water activity of one now if there's ions in solution water would be attracted to those molecules and a water activity would decrease so the lower the water activity the more uninhabitable an environment is and since water is required for all Life as We Know It water activity can be used to assess assess habitability so some common items in their water activities are listed on the left including sea water which has a pretty high water activity and the salinity of seawater is about 3.5 percent and then honey has a water activity of 0.6 and some of Mars special regions or areas where we might detect life on Mars are no lower than 0.5 and there's been a lot of really great pure culture work on the limits of life and cell division at different water activities and to sum it up the predicted or theoretical water activity limit for all life on Earth including eukaryotes and prokaryotes is about 0.6 and this is based on pure culture so like our speaker last night mentioned not all the things in the world are in pure culture yet so that leaves out about 90 or more of the biodiversity on Earth and our ability to assess what the limit of life for each of those strains of microbes are so brine environments are really widespread on Earth they're everywhere um and a lot of great work has gone into assessing metagenomics like the taxonomic diversity the potential metabolic metabolic potential of microbes in these environments metatranscriptomes and even some bulk activity measurements but metabolic activity is rarely measured at the Single Cell level and this can be really important because when a cell is stressed out they might have really low levels of activity that are not detected with bulk techniques so today I'll be talking a little bit about my work in solar cell turns and then transition into the my current work in Western Australia aesthetic brands so like I mentioned when life is reaching its limit a metabolic activity can be really low and so single cell analysis can help us detect the slow level of activity by lowering detection limits so a cell needs to acquire 50 new biomass to be able to divide into two new daughter cells however with Nano Sims for example we only need to detect about five percent maximum we can even get as low as less than one percent of new biomass to detect active life in a sample it also provides quantitative results so we can do a law with this data on a quantitative level and it also reveals trends that are often obscured by bulk analysis and when I'm talking about metabolic activity in this talk I'm talking specifically about anabolic activity so there's catabolic activity that produces energy for a cell and then there's anabolic activity where a cell can take substrates from the environment like amino acids and glucose and take that carbon and nitrogen and then produce new cell biomass which includes proteins DNA and cell walls and that sort of thing so first the work that I've done at this solar Sultan it's called South Bay saltworks it's in here in San Diego and basically they bring sea water in from San Diego Bay and it goes through a series of evapo concentration ponds and as the water evaporates out of the sea water different salts are left behind producing a series of ponds that range in water activity from 0.98 that of seawater to that well below the known limit of Life at 0.4 and so we measured anabolic activity of over 6 000 individual cells from a series of five of these brines with five different isotopic substrates from amino acids ammonium and bicarbonate glucose and nitrate and that sort of thing we measured their anabolic activity with nano SIM so on the left this is what this looks like cells that are circled in red are considered enriched and this is for carbon from amino acids and then the cells that are circled in white would be considered less active or less enriched in the sample and when you plot this with water activity you see that microbial activity decreases exponentially with water activity however there are certain areas so can we see this yeah yeah certain subsets of cells are more active than most of the cells in seawater at a higher water activity with even just low decreases in water activity we also detected cell biomass through dappy and nanosims in this low water activity magnesium chloride brine however we didn't detect any activity here and the incubation time was two days long so there's several reasons for this um we were also able to use this data to estimate a new predicted lower limit of Life at 0.54 so that's a little significantly biologically significantly lower than the 0.6 previous limit detected sorry predicted and this data I'd love to talk more about it but it's been submitted and I just got word that it's now in review the as of this morning so it's really exciting and if you'd like to hear more about that please talk to me later so now to kind of get into the topic of this talk which is I'm talking about the limits of life in acidic brine environments there's a lot of things that happen in brines so you can have salinity as a limiting factor you can have high metal concentrations you can have high ionic strength and chaotropicity but one thing that really stood out to me about this sample set was that most of the brines that had high levels of activity actually had a pH about seven or eight so like relatively neutral to slightly basic pH however this magnesium chloride brine which had no detectable activity had a pH of about 5.4 and so my question was how does pH affect microbial activity in brine environments and is this an important factor in the limits of life so last summer our team went to Western Australia to sample a bunch of acidic brines and these brines are considered Mars analogs because of the geochemistry and weathering systems that created them over millions of years um just in short oxidation of sulfides acidified the water and then evaporation concentrated ions and other salts over time creating these really acidic Briny environments um there's hundreds of these lakes and we were really lucky to sample a really broad spectrum of them so on the x axis is water activity and on the y axis is pH and I was really thrilled to get a nice group of lakes to sample for activity analysis especially these ones that are boxed these are were at a water activity of 0.7 and they range in PH so it's a really good opportunity to kind of look at how pH affects my metabolism at low water activity so with this uh this study I analyzed metabolic activity specifically anabolic activity by incubating these brines with an analog amino acid called hpg cells that are active in the sample will take up hpg and incorporate them into their new proteins that are produced and then the hpg has a alkyne group on the end that later on in lab you can perform click chemistry on and click a four or four to it so all the cells that are active in the sample turn out green under the microscope or in flow cytometry and then that can be counter stained or compared to cells that are stained blue via DNA stain of doping and so with this data you can calculate the percent of active cells across these Lakes so this is just an example of what this data set looks like these are just four of the 13 or 14 lakes that we were able to do this with on the left the lakes are ordered and decreasing pH and I thought it was also kind of interesting the color changes so you can admire those I don't know why they do that but that's the way it is and then in the middle are the dappy stain cells under the microscope and then on the right are the active cells that are tagged with the green fluorophore you can also notice like the different cell morphologies and abundances that change with ph which is really fascinating and also that pH didn't affect the assay itself we do see some cells that are active at these low ph's and sometimes you have Brands where there's less activity happening there so when you calculate the percent of active cells and you put this all in a plot I'll just Orient you so on the x axis here we have water activity decreasing and on the y axis is pH decreasing in this direction so you would expect the most extreme acidic brines to be kind of in this region um this dotted line is that newly predicted water activity limit of life that I talked about earlier and then this dotted line represents the percent of active cells dropping below 50 at this pH so this color block each of the dots is one Lake and the color bar was colored on a green gradient if the percent of active cells is above 50 and on a gradient towards black if it was below 50 so you can kind of just visually see that all of the green like high percentage act cells cluster up here and all of the low percent of active cells cluster down here and when you look at it statistically there is a moderately stronger correlation with ph and activity compared to water activity and activity so so many times you can count how many times I say activity in this talk um and so some thoughts on this a pH of six is really high for environmental samples and as we've heard from a lot of people and as we know there's a lot of microbes that live in way more acidic environments so what's actually happening here I don't have an answer to that yet and I'm hoping to figure that out with future analyzes that include nanosims work on these Lakes um and then if this is a true signal and this is what what is going on in the environment then microbial activity may be detected at lower water activities than we know of now as long as the pH is within the seven to eight maybe like not so acidic range um so figuring out what that PH range is and how that interacts with water activity limits of life um is something of ongoing investigation so with that I'd like to acknowledge my lab the DECA slab pictured up in the rights all of our funding sources the oceans across space and time team which is a nasa funded project you'll hear about uh you'll hear from a lot of us throughout this conference and all of our collaborators in Western Australia including Molly the dingo who of course this work would not have been possible without all right and then I'll take any questions and I'll leave this up so you can stare at the dots for a little bit longer [Applause] any questions hi uh that was really cool talk thanks so much um I was just wondering if he could expand a little bit on why you concentrate onion anabolic um activity as opposed to catabolic activity yeah so let's see scientifically the reason why I would focus on anabolic activity I mean both catabolic and anabolic activity are essential for life right life has to make energy to assimilate substrates and ground divides so both processes are really important and they are processes that I'll be combining or looking at in future field sites um with anabolic activity the interesting thing here is that you could imagine that when a cell gets really stressed out it would stop dividing potentially and still accumulate substrates to repair DNA repair cell walls do all that stuff until conditions get better and so the idea was that or my original hypothesis was that by um that anabolic activity would extend beyond the known cell division limit of life because even as cells are um cells would be able to survive just by taking up materials and so that taking up process is the anabolic Activity Part yeah sweet talk I have a question so um you mentioned that you guys have essentially like uh extrapolated uh new like limit for life like in terms of water activity it's kind of a power move so we're not the first ones to do this okay but okay but uh could you explain how you extrapolated that because I think maybe I missed that or I didn't understand yeah um okay we're gonna get into the weeds here but let me go back to that slide um so this this idea or this like extrapolation is based on um these this study here so they did the same thing and this is how they got this theoretical limit of life that has now been cited almost 200 times from food preservation fields to life detection Fields so um hasn't been published yet um so the reason so they used a different technique and they based it on cell division and so we're um so hang on let me answer your first question so um the way that we did this is single cell analysis allows you to separate the cells that are active from those that are inactive and in a brine environment this is really important because brines are really salty and cells can fall in from anywhere bird poop wind whatever and get preserved and those can be inactive so those can contribute to that bulk analysis and not necessarily even be important in that environment so a single cell analysis we took out the active cells average their anabolic activities so we're just focusing on who's contributing to metabolism in that environment and then use detection limits and and math to extrapolate and predict or propose this new predicted limit of detectable life and so this is not the limit of life this is what our measurements can detect and if we found an environment at 0.54 Water activity with similar conditions to this environment that we extrapolated it from we would technically be able to detect life in that environment and this is also a really conservative limit so um we even upped the number of standard deviations that we would normally do for our like detection limit so if we were to do like our data processing in the normal way it might even be lower that kind of hey George eibel from Montana State I'm just curious uh you're looking at the Active cells were you did you look at who they were at all whether that was by fish or sequencing so in this study we did not look at cell identity and we focused on metabolism in Western Australia I don't have plans to look at the actual I don't know I could look at the Active fraction of cells from the bond cat analysis I haven't decided if I want to go down that road yet but in the next field site we are planning on on doing that so um yeah not in this not in a city all right thank you very much Emily yeah thank you [Music] [Applause] okay for our next speaker we have Zoe havelena from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology that New Mexico Tech pretty short is fine um so hi I'm Zoe havlina I am a PhD candidate from New Mexico Tech um and I would like to just jump right in and introduce my field site for this project which are two cave systems located in central Italy so pictured here they're very pretty and what I can hopefully show you I'm going to take us on a quick field trip there is why these are potentially very compelling sites for astrobiology or for a Geo microbiologists such as myself and so these caves form through a somewhat rare mechanism which is known as sulfuric acid speliogenesis so this is a cave building process that's seen only in a handful of caves worldwide and only only a fraction of those can we actually access those caves and see this process actively happening today and so that's what I'm showing you here so these are all images from one of my field sites which is a fresasi Cave System and what you're looking at in this image here on the left this is a stream this is the groundwater level of the cave and it's enriched in hydrogen sulfide and this hydrogen sulfide degases where there's voids in the host Rock of the cave and this hydrogen sulfide fuels very a robust microbial communities that are thriving off of the energy in this otherwise very leukotrophic environment and this is seen kind of conspicuously in the forms of these charismatically named snodite biofilms which proliferate in these areas of the cave here's another picture of what they look like and we also sometimes see if you can see the yellow dots native sulfur that can precipitate in these areas as well and these are primarily composed of citythial bacillus which is a sulfur oxidizing bacteria but what I'm interested in for the context of my project are all of these white I don't know if you can see my pointer here these white clumpy minerals here and this is actually microcrystalline gypsum this precipitates in part kind of as a consequence of this microbial activity because these sulfur oxidizers are producing sulfuric acid which is obviously highly corrosive when you have a carbonate host Rock and so this gypsum is precipitating as a replacement as this host Rockets corroded and it's highly acidic so pH is usually zero to one and what happens is that this gypsum can build up in these cave systems and remain there essentially as long as you don't have any Waters that come in and wash it away and so that's what I'm showing on this image on the far right here this is one of these like massive gypsum deposits that exists in a part of the Versace cave that hasn't been exposed to this active sulfide degassing for maybe a hundred to two hundred thousand years and so we see sulfates and gypsum on other locations notably the surface of Mars so I'm showing you data here as it relates to the Gale crater and there's some evidence or some thinking that this sulfates could have also precipitated under acidic conditions so potentially these are thought of as places where we might look for for evidence of life and on the Earth's surface the analogs that we have there are several and these have been well studied by other teams of astrobiologists but what is novel um or the argument I'm making for these caves is that this is an ecosystem that as I just showed you is fueled by chemo litho autotrophy so these kind of alternative Lifestyles and so potentially studying the gypsum and its ability to preserve or not preserve biosignatures is is kind of a novel aspect and gets away from surface world where we sometimes see the signatures mostly of things that are photosynthetic and so in the context of this talk when I'm talking about life detection or I'm talking about signatures I'm talking about lipid biomarkers specifically and so what I'm showing you here are some types of these they were kind of explained earlier these ones on the left which are those hopenoids so these are produced by bacteria and these can be functionalized and then they have this very recalcitrant backbone structure this hoping that is this diagenetic structure that can persist in some terrestrial environments for potentially millions of years and then on the right these are gdgts from archaea so kind of a similar lipid biomarker and the these specific structures that I'm showing you are ones that have been classified from those snodite biofilms that I showed you in their earlier image and so knowing what we already know about these cave systems which is that we have gypsum that is precipitating in in very close association with microbial activity that's kind of these microbes that are using an alternative lifestyle and we know that some of these organisms like that aciditythylbacillus are capable of producing these lipid biomarkers and this gypsum is kicking around in this cave for a little bit of time we sort of used what we know to form these questions about things that we don't know um we don't actually know or going into the study no one had ever looked at what microbes are colonizing the surface of the gypsum itself and we don't know if those organisms produce their own lipid biomarker Suite if we'll be able to characterize that or detect it in the gypsum at all and then if we do does that persist in this gypsum that has been existing in this cave for a longer period of time and so I won't go into the Weeds on these methods here but I just want to highlight that we're using kind of a few different approaches to answer some of these questions so using some sort of classic molecular biology techniques amplicon sequencing and metagenomics to characterize those microbial communities and then using some organic geochemical techniques to try to characterize those lipid biomarkers and so some of the data that I've had um is that these gypsum surfaces are in fact colonized by microbes and so what I'm showing you here is amplicon sequencing data so that's 16sr in our sequencing that tells us who's there and what I want you to take away from this graph is that I'm plotting two things here on the left to this access and the blue dots is showing the percent of that acid bacillus so that's that main sulfate oxidizing bacteria that we see in those snodite biofilms and then on the right I'm showing in this orange I'm showing you the overall diversity of these samples and so all these dots are gypsum samples that we're taking at kind of varying distances from that active lead degassing sulfate extreme and just a reminder so these statite biofilms that have been previously characterized are around 70 percent of citythal bacillus and so the main takeaway is that are samples of gypsum are far more diverse than that you know even at this kind of like best case scenario where we're the closest to the sulfate extreme we're really not seeing anywhere near 70 percent of city thal bacillus and so this is data from that other cave that I've studied and I don't have that nice distance gradient but again it's plotting the same things and I've just kind of broadly lumped these samples together in terms of like high level of sulfide medium level lower levels and again we see a similar Trend we also see low levels of acetyl bacillus and in fact we see a heck of a lot of archaea too so some of these samples were almost entirely archaea and why I talk about acetyl bacillus and I talk about the diversity of these samples is that you know we know acetyl bacillus is capable of producing lipid biomarkers but it's one of the bacteria that can and in fact a lot of them can't and so this potentially has implications when we think about you know are there things that is in this gypsum that is producing lipid biomarkers or aren't there and we can kind of get at this um indirectly through metagenomics and so again metagenomics is looking at all of the genes that are present in a particular environmental sample and so far I have only reconstructed a single metagenome and this is from a native sulfur deposit but I did do some Gene searching and I was looking for this squaly and hoping cyclase Gene which forms a critical precursor to making those hopenoid lipid biomarkers and I did find some copies of that but again I also found a ton of archaea and two of the high quality bins that I was able to assemble were these two kind of Novel archaea that have potentially an interesting symbiotic relationship and I would love to talk about that more but that's kind of a whole other talk so I'm just going to leave it at that with this complicated figure here on the right um so it you might be guessing or kind of wondering why I've only gotten one metagenome so far and really it's because the overall biomass in these gypsum samples is very low and so what I'm showing you in this picture here so this is microscopy this is dappy staining so looking at cells and so you see hopefully you can see just a few blue dots those are cells and on the right this is showing them sitting in a bathtub full of gypsum micro crystals and so when you just kind of contextualize this low number of cells in in the vast array of all of these minerals there's not a whole lot going on and in fact some of our preliminary total organic carbon measurements are less than one percent or even a fraction of a percent and so that all leads to kind of some complications with trying to actually extract some of these lipid biomarkers and so this side of the project is still an active protocol development we haven't seen anything yet um and so we've had to kind of scale up our extraction we're hoping to extract a lot more gypsum and and I'm hoping that that's something I'll be able to talk about more in the future but I just want to return to sort of The Guiding question of this of this study which is you know looking at these very um interesting microbial Dynamics the way that the stripsum is formed we see a lot of we see biofilms existing where where the zone is forming but we don't know if there's biomarkers that are preserved or not and I have to leave that question open at this time um but hopefully I can answer it in the future so I think I will just leave off there and I wouldn't be able to do this work without I have a lot of very fantastic collaborators and funding sources and I would especially like to thank all the folks at the astrobiology analytical laboratory at Goddard and I think that I have some time for questions so thank you [Applause] thank you Zoe hey um I'm bunny Chase I'm from the jet propulsion laboratory I really love this question you're asking and like the way that you're trying to attack it and I was wondering a lot of the lipid biomarkers that you talked about looking for they as you said can be preserved for a few millions of years but what about the more stable versions like looking for her pains rather than hope Knowles are you also looking for those yeah yeah we are I didn't really explain that super well but we are hoping to look for helping hoping to look for Hope pains as well yeah and um what do you think like the preservation is in this cave would be for the molecules and how similar is that to Mars yeah I think that that is kind of the key question for sure um there I don't know if that's something that I want to dive into right now but I think we should talk about it later for sure I'm curious to hear your thoughts on it as well um obviously this is a oxidizing environment it's it's acidic it's wet so it has a lot that could maybe not be preserving things but um you know certainly folks have done similar research and and have found biomarkers in in Gypsum and other environments on Earth so it's a it's a good question any last questions for Zoe okay thank you so much oh wait there's Chad sorry hey so I have a question about the microcrystalline nature of that gypsum so what do you think that might what's your hypothesis for structurally how that might affect preservation of Bio signatures as opposed to other kinds of gypsum that might happen on the surface yeah I think that that's a really good question um I guess you know off the top of my head I would say that I don't know if we're gonna get it like doesn't really layer I think necessarily in the way that we see in like evaporative gypsum um how that may or may not you know factor into biosignature preservation I don't I can't really speak to that but it is I think it's definitely a really interesting difference um that we see in this gypsum for sure and it's like it's I didn't really show any of the like there's that one picture that I showed of the gypsum but it's it's crazy it's like you know we call it Rock in name only um it's it's like goo um you go to sample it and it's almost like a non Newtonian fluid it like just kind of like oozes um which is super wild and and it's kind of difficult to work with to be honest yeah all right thank you so much Zoe [Applause] okay so our next speaker is Kimberly Sinclair from the University of Washington hi I'm Kimberly Sinclair I'm from the University of Washington department of Earth and space Sciences I'm working with David catling and Tim Elam I'm going to talk to you guys about this project the mineralogy of evaporites and sediments in the alkaline phosphate Rich Lakes so the Caribou Plateau which is work I've been doing with Sebastian Haas and is funded by the Simons Foundation okay so I want to give you a bit of background about the phosphorus problem in astrobiology because I know we're all coming from very different backgrounds uh there's a lot of biology talks this morning though so I'm sure a lot of you guys are caught up on this but uh so we all know DNA on the right hand side here has this sugar phosphate backbone and then you have your base pairs or if you zoom in closer you're seeing your phosphate group your sugar and your nuclear base here and in order to get this phosphate to incorporate into the nucleotide you need very high levels of phosphate and this has been shown by research done by powder at all in 2009 so this question we want to ask is how much phosphorus is actually available for Prebiotic phosphorylation on early Earth and even though we need these very high concentrations of phosphate up to one molar in Prebiotic phosphorylation experiments we only see very low concentrations of phosphate in the environment close to the micromolar level and that's because in natural Waters phosphate will combine with calcium and Fallout of solution as an insoluble mineral known as appetite or calcium phosphate before reaching very high concentrations so there's a bit of a problem here and that's what we call the phosphorus problem uh We've proposed a solution to the phosphorus problem uh in a paper by toner and catling in 2020 the hypothesis was stated that abundant carbonate leads to calcite formation calcite being calcium carbonate thus suppressing the calcium phosphate mineral formation and leaving phosphorus in solution to concentrate to higher levels so in order to test this Theory we visited the most phosphorus Rich lake in the world uh this plot on the right hand side is from toner and catling 2020 you see a very high phosphorus concentrations in these lakes on the top right side which are good enough in last chance Lake and so that's where we wanted to visit to understand why you're getting these very high concentrations of phosphorus we can then apply our understanding of these Lakes to possible analog Lakes on Prebiotic Earth where origin of life could have happened so a little bit about these Lakes Last Chance in good enough Lakes are carbonate Rich alkaline soda lakes on the Caribou plateau in British Columbia Canada left hand side you see the map of British Columbia here in this green swath is the Caribou Plateau it's right East of those coastal mountains not too far north of Vancouver if you were to zoom in on Google Maps you would see the lakes here good enough Lake here and last chance Lake here um they both have very high phosphate concentrations but particularly Last Chance Lake gets up to 37 millimolar of phosphorus which is very high in comparison to that micromolar level that we're usually seeing in natural Waters and this is an image of Last Chance Lake taken in November 2021 which is what it looks like from the ground level so you're seeing it form into these sort of brine pools so a little bit of context from these Lakes they're too small less than kilometer squared shallow closed Basin lakes with sodium carbonate sulfate chlorine brines these are typical major ions of soda Lakes developed on basaltic Rock their sulfate potassium phosphate and magnesium are abundant whereas calcium iron silicon and dissolved inorganic nitrogen are present at very low concentrations the salinity reaches up to 462 grams per liter which is about 13 times seawater salinity so they're very salty and the pH ranges from 9.7 to 10.7 in both of these Lakes depending on the time of year and the location in The Lakes because they do get spring in fed from surrounding rivers and such or sorry from groundwater not reverse so we wanted to go and visit these Lakes over different seasons in order to understand how the mineralogy of different precipitates and evaporites as well as precipitates in the sediments change um so we went in winter summer and fall and you can see the corresponding pictures here in Winter 2021 you see these brine pools starting to freeze over um and summer 22 to 2022 it enters this ephemeral Lake stage where it has enough water that it actually covers the entire surface and then in Autumn 2022 these brine pools are drying out into Salt Flats and so there's basically no water left in this system at all it's just salt so we wanted to collect lots of different evaporites which are these salts that are forming around the lake shore as well as precipitates within the lake these are different fun examples of evaporites we collected so in our winter trip you get a lot of these salts forming on rocks Around the Lake Shores around the brine pools in June this is an example of a precipitate that formed and fell to the bottom of the lake and so you can pick it up from under the water it's a lot of salt mixed in with mud and clay and then in September when it's in that salt crust phase you can dig into the salt crust and take this out and that's what the cross section looks like so you're getting these very white opaque salts on the top that middle layer of translucent Natron salt in the middle and then a layer of algae right above the mud we also wanted to collect sediments from the lake bottom and so these are pictures of us collecting different sediment samples with sediment cores we did it both around the lake shore as well as at the lake bottom and then the center picture you see is us taking those sudden cores and chopping off different depths in order to see how the mineralogy changes with depth in the sediments so we did a mineralogy analysis with x ray diffraction we used a Booker d8 powder x ray diffractometer with a copper anode microfocus x ray source which is the microfocus X ray source is really useful when you have very small quantities of powder that you're trying to analyze and plotus 100K large area 2D detector is really helpful when you want to increase the resolution of your diffraction patterns um just a quick note about sample preparation we tried to isolate the mineral phases visually as much as we could from our samples in order to simplify the pattern matching grind it up really fine you want to have good particle statistics for x ray diffraction and then dropping it onto a silk zero background sample holder to try and get that flat homogeneous surface that's so important and then for those of you who haven't seen xrd Data before this is sort of what it looks like uh you've got your tooth Theta on the x axis intensity and the y axis and your observed pattern is in blue this is using a software called gsas2 which is an open source code for xrd analysis and then you're trying to match uh database database patterns of different minerals to this observed pattern and so the calculated one pattern that's a conglomeration of all the different mineral phases we've identified as shown in green overlaid on top of that observed pattern so this is an example of one evaporite and one sediment from these Lakes going through on this evaporate here we've identified multiple different sodium carbonate phases so there's a lot of thermonitorite which is sodium carbonate with one water molecule at the 60 percent weight percent level and then for reference in this sample here the thermonitrite is this blue and so each mineral you're supposed to you expect to see different Peaks and the two Theta range and so we're just matching those Peaks we're also seeing Toronto which is another sodium carbonate as well as the nardite sodium sulfate halide sodium chloride burkite which is a sodium carbonate sulfate and acolyte sodium bicarbonate so these mineral phases are all very common and these evaporates we're finding across these Lakes while in the sediment we're seeing a lot of feldspars like albeitgeite as well as the north of Clays in a North eye and other samples around the 70 to 20 to 30 percent range um a secondary phase we're seeing a lot of in the sediments is Dolomite which is that calcium magnesium carbonate and that's very important I'll come back to that in a moment we're also seeing a lot of minor phases like quartz and vesuvianite and other things like that that are just present in the natural soil in the area so then you do this a bunch more times because you're a graduate student and you do a lot of Labor and you take a lot of samples and this comes together into the complete xrd results from the study so I've divided this into results for last chance Lake as well as good enough Lake and then in each respective like the sediments and the salts the salts being the evaporites around the Lakeshore as well as the precipitates and the lake on the left hand side we have all the different mineral phases we've identified so in the sediments the main phases of Interest were these feldspars both plagioclase feldspar as well as Alkali or k feld spars as well as Dolomite those calcium carbonates is and Mica the clay minerals we're also seeing some thermonitrite that sodium carbonate and the good enough Lake sediments but not in the last chance Lake sediments and then the main mineral phases we're seeing in the evaporites or the salts are those sodium carbonates both thermonitrite and Trona as well as burkite that sodium carbonate sulfate a quick word about hydrated minerals we only detected thermonitrite which is sodium carbonate with one water molecule in the xod patterns after sample preparation however previous studies of this area have identified natural salts as the predominant phase Natron is just sodium carbonate with 10 water molecules and so if the relative humidity is below 60 percent at zero degrees Celsius or 70 percent at room temperature then Natron will lose its water and turn into therminatrite and so we're just anticipating that's what happened in our samples here since the relative humidity in indoor environments is around 50 percent so you can see this plot on the right hand side from Haines at all showing Natron here turning into thermonitrite when you've decreased relative humidity and increased temperature so in summary we found that the evaporites or the salts are dominated by sodium carbonates sodium carbonate sulfate and sodium chloride demonstrating the predominance of that sodium ion in The Lakes whereas the sediments are dominated by carbonates both Dolomite and acry as well as feldspars plagioclase and K feldspar quartz peroxine and Clay minerals however the big takeaway was we found no calcium phosphate which is that appetite I talked about earlier in any of the samples and this was confirmed by icpms data showing very low abundance of phosphorus and all of the different samples we've taken so it's not just an xrd fluke it's also backed up by Elemental abundances um these results are consistent with the hypothesis that calcium carbonates precipitate early in the mineralization sequence of these Lakes thus decreasing the dissolved calcium concentrations and allowing phosphate to accumulate to high concentrations instead of precipitating out as appetite which is that calcium phosphate um so phosphates accumulating to high concentrations in solution and that's great for that Prebiotic phosphorylation that you need very high phosphate concentrations to get that incorporation into your nucleotides and the potential origin of life so these could be really good environments for analogs for hidea and Earth Lakes where life started and that's it [Applause] thanks Kimberly we have plenty of time for questions I have a quick one for you yeah um do you know how good enough Lake was named tension and when they got they got back east I was just curious because when we were in Australia there was a lot of strange Lake names out there like dead kangaroo uh Peaks Piggery and we didn't really understand like the history of them but yeah anyway there were a lot of jokes in the field uh about oh it's our last chance to get our last chance sample and stuff like that hi I'm Ellie from CU Boulder and I was wondering if the so I know you said your sediments are a pledge doll Micah and feldspar dominated I was curious if you would think that the similar pattern that you saw here would happen even if your soda Lake was hosted by a different type of like set like Base Rock essentially like if we change instead of balsaltic or things like that like do you feel like the same pattern would hold in terms of the precipitation of the evaporites yeah um these Lakes are very dependent on the host mineralogy and so you wouldn't expect to see the same um aqueous chemistry in a different host environment and that's one of the reasons why these uh this environment is so interesting is because of that uh plagi Clays Base Rock causing um this very specific aqueous chemistry so even just like what is it 100 miles nearby is an incredibly sulfate rich Lake that people study for different reasons so slight change in geology big change in aqueous chemistry a really interesting talk uh I have kind of two questions um you mentioned that you collected samples seasonally ended sediment by death measurements do you see any variability in your mineralization based on like seasons and was that reflected any depth transect yes we hoped we would see more variation but we didn't uh the only variation you really saw was that you could say and maybe this isn't even a statistically like significant conclusion is that you might see more Dolomite at the top of the sediment core so like right in the interaction Zone with the water you're getting less Dolomite at depth which makes sense for calcium carbonate precipitating out of solution whereas at depth in the sediment cores you're getting more of those feldspars which is just the host Rock but not as much in terms of seasonal variation two slides back yeah so like you have data for I think uh necklite uh and third nine diet which has uncertainty higher than the data so is it normal or how can you explain this sorry could you say the last part again so the uncertainty in the data is higher than the the value so can you explain this yes because a lot of these samples only have these minor phases and a couple of the samples um and so there's just not very good counting statistics we're talking about maybe three out of 100 samples or something that have these minor phases um so yeah a Taylor plattner at Georgia Institute of Technology this was really cool I had no idea that these Lakes were so high in phosphate um I know a couple of people that are have studied like last chance Lake and then the basket Lakes um I was curious um because you were saying at the end you know interesting in terms of like the origin of Life have you thought about actually I have a couple questions um have you thought about like looking at what may be preserved in in these salts or and I also have a question on I know you did xrd do you plan on doing any other analyzes um with your samples yeah so I guess your first question about if we're studying uh the present Life in The Lakes yeah so um out of my macroscopic scale when you go there it's really interesting because you see all these brine flies that are just encrusted in the salt which is kind of it's kind of freaky because in the summer you're like encompassed by flies and then in the winter it's like a fly cemetery and there's just a bunch of dead flies in the ground but um in a more astrobiology sense um there are other teams at I think it's shoot University in Canada who are studying the current microbiology in the ice because there are living microbes in the ice in the winter and so we're not necessarily doing that work but there are colleagues who are um wait what was your second question yes okay so uh my section of the work was a lot about the mineralogy of the sediments and the evaporites but my colleagues Sebastian Haas did a lot more of the water chemistry um and so we're submitting a paper now and hopefully you'll be able to read that and hear all about his work as well thank you very much Kimberly yeah [Applause] okay our final speaker of salty stuff if PowerPoint will work oh is Chad pazoriski from Georgia Tech all right so uh I'm gonna call back a little bit to a couple of the sites that Emily mentioned before and uh what's exciting for me is that I'm in San Diego for the first time so I finally might be able to go see one of the field sites I'm about to talk about and I had no idea that they were actually palm trees down here around my supposedly extreme field site so that'll be a a funny dichotomy there but um so yeah we're gonna be following the salt uh and it's going to be a lot of salt so uh uh hang tight there so the first field site South Bay saltworks which is down the road um is a salt Farm which as water is taken from the bay it is brought in and um the the people there are are basically taking the the hay light out and using that to I believe soften the water here and then the magnesium chloride also gets concentrated and and separated and so you get these um these really sodium chloride concentrated uh regions and magnesium concentrated magnesium chloride concentrated regions and then you also have uh regions which are a lot more like seawater and so um that's South Bay salt works that's one of the sites I'll be talking about a lot today and what we're investigating there um with oceans across space and time uh is can bioseignature molecules be detected in these sites um with these super high salinities and uh then how does that input impact our search for life elsewhere and um then how do these vary with things like water activity and ion concentration and then here's another analog site in Western Australia this is Lake Campion which is a very interesting site that we looked at um and uh so these are transient lakes and so uh they um they evaporate during the drier warmer months and then they fill up during the winter months and so you get these salt crusts which build up on the bottom of them and so uh these are really interesting because uh the the evaporation process is happening very actively so we can get a modern look um at what's happening there and so in general analog sites can give us training grounds for robotic exploration on other planets they can help us test our instruments and uh particularly we want to know how salt and acid acidic uh um low PH environments affect our uh our instruments and then it can give us insight into the environmental processes and the biology happening there and so uh now I'm going to uh shout out uh Luke Fisher's review paper in environmental microbiology where he talks all about the bioseignature preservation in brines particularly in deep hyper saline anoxic basins which I won't be talking about today but when it comes to brines themselves as opposed to evaporates or salt crystals um we know that DNA and RNA are well preserved while mRNA is not as well preserved and that ATP preservation has been observed by uh to ovala at all in 1987. um but not much has been done about that since then and lipid preservation is being studied more and more recently and so that's good but but these aren't nearly as well explored um as genetic uh compounds and so uh one compound that we're looking at ATP adenosine triphosphate it's a short lived molecule and it's used in astrobiology and in ecology as a marker of microbial activity and so if you have a lot of ATP means that a lot of microbial activity is happening if you don't have any microbial activity then you're probably not going to have much ATP but it's very highly evolved so as a biosignature it might be less agnostic than for example amino acids and so we could look at polypeptides or we could look at individual amino acids and we target biological amino acids in this study as well as osmolite amino acids which are solute compounds that are accumulated by microbes when they're under high stress in hyper saline sites yeah so and that's well understood in the literature that these osmolites exist and so first I'll talk about the methods that we used in in the field um or near the field in the motel room we uh looked for ATP using a luciferase assay and so say you have a beautiful Crystal uh uh from the crust of a lake like this from Western Australia then you take it to your Western Australia motel room and you do a uh you set out your samples we weigh them out we extract them in hot water and then we add our luciferase and luciferin and we have a field portable luminometer in order to do our analyzes and so that's how we uh quantify ATP and moving on to what we do at Georgia Tech when we bring the samples home so uh I was so glad to hear that uh another uh person here was using capillary electrophoresis so I don't need to explain it in its entirety again but um it's a separation method that uh in our lab we pair with laser induced fluorescence and so laser induced fluorescence mean means that we're tagging our amino acids our compounds of Interest with a fluorescent dye so we're targeting specific compounds um and so this is a targeted technique which has very low limits of detection and very high sensitivity and so um we did this at South Bay saltworks on one of the samples that has a water activity of below 0.4 and magnesium concentration of more than four molar and uh this is only a one to ten dilution so using a method that um Marshall Seton and I developed uh we got the concentration of amino acids in this sample down to tens of nanomolar the limits of detection for this method General are in the tense of picomolar and we did this using a commercial instrument um and again it was only a one to ten dilution for this uh hyper saline uh sample so we were delighted that uh the results came out like this and then for an untargeted analysis we can use uh microchip capillary electrophoresis paired with uh high resolution Mass spectrometry so if we take the same sample and we look at it using an untargeted method where we can get the master charge ratio of the compounds that we're interested in then uh combining the zip chip commercial setup with a thermal Q exactive orbitrap we this is what the chip looks like it's very cute uh we get a very interesting set of compounds which we didn't necessarily Target and so uh moving back to the LIF analyzes for the results what we first observed was that as we increase in magnesium concentration and decrease in water activity and increase in chaotropicity we get a significant increase in the dissolved free primary amines that we were targeting and so that would be our biological amino acids which you've identified here and as you go up you have higher magnesium sites and we have a lot higher Peaks and we also have a lot higher values for Quantified amino acids and so we attribute this to evapo concentration as the sites which have a lot of water and a lot of salt and then evaporate and leave the salts and the Organics behind the concentration is higher so that's pretty straightforward and simple but it is very useful in the case where we're looking at very low biomass regions so next we then put it in micro microchip cems and we looked for these same compounds and we found a lot of them there and so you can see histidine Glycine alanine isoleucine and leucine are resolved there serine Etc et cetera glutamic and aspartic acid um and this was only a one to four dilution of that same sample so we were really delighted by these results as well and in the same separation just um looking at different traces different M over Z's we see a couple polypeptides and we see some adenine and guanidine in there as well uh and so these are things that we didn't necessarily look for in the celif but now that we're combining it with an untargeted method we can we can get a look at some more compounds that we didn't necessarily expect and then also osmolites which we did expect and did want to look for we found those like ornithine sarcasine and betaine in our samples with very high salt stress being applied to any of the microbes that were alive there um and and so these are are there in significant quantity and in Western Australia uh briefly I'll just show you some preliminary results this is Lake Brown which has a sodium concentration of near five molar and a water activity of 0.89 so not nearly as low water activity as the South Bay saltwork sample I just showed you um but it has high relative concentrations of a lot of these compounds including the osmolite compound baiting and some lower concentrations of other compounds including a polypeptide and then conversely at Lake Gunter which has a higher water activity and a lower sodium concentration we see that there really isn't any easy way to detect those organic compounds with with the method that we're using right now so just diluting these samples so perhaps this indicates that the uh and of course there's only two data points with Western Australia but you know looking at the what we found at South Bay saltworks perhaps these saltier sites are actually places where it might be easier to detect biomolecules because of evapo concentration and we also want to look at the normalized abundance of certain amino acids just to see what sort of patterns we could find and if we have water activity increasing from left to right here with the Magnesium sites here we see that certain amino acids are upright regulated in this magnesium heavy site and others are down regulated and with that information we decided maybe we could classify our sites based on the amino acid distribution so if you take the distribution in you put in a classifier either logistic regression or random Forest you could get out one of these three different site types and this is a small data set and more of a proof of concept than anything but it's interesting to see that we have a very good area under the curve of you know 1 or 0.83 which uh and and we also can see which compounds are driving that the most and so that's an interesting thing to take note of that might be used in the future if we have much larger data sets and so the last thing I wanted to talk about ATP if you remember so uh on the x axis here's a magnesium concentration and then we have three y axes because why not and um uh first of all I want to mention the cell counts by microscopy which is uh from Ben klempe uh showed that the number of active cells in these sites go down as you get to the super high magnesium concentration regions which is also um what Emily showed in her talk and so uh what we then can look at is the ATP concentration which strangely goes up even as the concentration of active cells goes down and the expected activity goes down and so we wondered why is that happening because um as we know the amino acids are concentrating but amino acids don't Decay on really short time scales they're not broken up by hydrolysis or by atpase enzymes but we think is that something must be driving this and if it's not of Apple concentration uh well uh we're wondering you know since the ATP hydrolysis rate is uh much quicker than the evapo concentration rate uh why would the ATP accumulate doesn't really make much sense but perhaps it's being preserved so this to ovala at all paper from 1987 that I mentioned way earlier uh they found that ATP was preserved in low water activity sites and so that could be preventing the enzymatic uh and natural hydrolysis of ATP leaving it to uh persist in the solution and additionally it could also be used as an osmolite compound as well and be accumulated by those microorganisms before they end up in a super high magnesium site and not very active themselves so in conclusion we can detect biosignatures at micromolar concentrations in near saturation brines using celif and microce Ms and amino acid distribution ratios can be well classified based on their brine type and osmolites are present and detectable in some but not all of the South Bay saltworks in Western Australia Brines and we found preservation of ATP at South Bay saltworks and so um basically my argument is then why don't we follow the salt and see if we can find biosignatures there on other worlds so thanks for listening [Applause] thank you Chad we have time for two questions Chad thank you for the talk um that was a beautiful separation that you showed uh showed earlier and so I'm I'm curious uh you did a connotation of amino acids using celf method and it looks like you've done some work using cems have you tried uh quantifying the amino acid content in the same sites using microchip cems and seeing what those look like to try and like cross validate both methods and the using the same sample yet or have you not got to that yet nope so we just started doing the micro CMS work over the past month and so we're really happy how it's been doing with qualitative untargeted work but we haven't gone into quantitative because the ion suppression effects might be a bit of a challenge to overcome so that'll probably be a little bit of a longer project what we have done to try to corroborate the amino acid concentrations is look at the expression of um or not the expression rather but the presence of certain proteins in the genetic code of the microbes that are were found to be present here by other uh host collaborators and um we find a moderate correlation between the amino acids we see and the amino acids that they see but since we don't have transcriptomes from all these sites we don't know exactly what proteins are being made and so I think that's the next step is is to connect those from metabolomics to transcriptomics to genomics just as the talk last night uh was uh was discussing so yeah thank you any last question for Chad um I have a two question actually oh maybe I didn't really catch you what's a pH of the site that you show the Magnesium concentration is more than four molar that's a great question I don't know off the top of my head but I can get back to you in a moment yeah okay um and also how would you determine your atp's accumulated or protected under high selling water or like low water activity how did I sorry say again how did I how do you know that your ATP non hydrolysis so yeah I don't know that it's not hydrolyzed necessarily but I am predicting that so the the typical destruction method of ATP uh either in the cell or in the environment is through hydrolysis either performed by proteins or just um happening naturally in the environment with water and so those are the those are the things that must uh from what I'm observing have been stopped if the ATP is going to persist so long for it to be evapo concentrated to those high of levels um the huge Spike there likely wouldn't have been possible if of Apple concentration weren't a component and so um you know unless uh the uh the osmolite effect is is uh so much more significant than I had thought um that could be another reason but I still think that uh the the preservation of ATP is yeah is linked to the the lack of a um a rapid breakdown mechanism uh have you ever considered that ATP with um form some nanostructures to make the things happen yeah so whether it stabilizes it in some way the yeah so I've I don't honestly know much about how it would investigate that I've spoken to someone recently about um potentially modeling it uh using molecular Dynamics but uh I haven't you know waded into the um you know the actual uh the structural chemistry of whether of whether that would happen but if you have any ideas I'd love to hear so thanks yeah thanks Chad foreign okay so that concludes all the talks for today um we have a extended poster session so it's a little bit longer than the others because we have some excellent local undergrads that you'll find outside in the back patio and thanks to a group at upper campus the cosmic tours we have an indoor planetarium that's a few doors down Miguel just posted a little map of where it is so we encourage you like throughout the poster session see if you can get in there I think it's about a 20 minute tour or so um and besides that we're all going to meet at Shore Rider at seven o'clock that's when we'll start serving dinner and then trivia will start right at eight so just feel free to relax the hotel or something before and then let Miguel or I know if you have any any questions or concerns thanks [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
