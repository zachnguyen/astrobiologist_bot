[Music] in the first lecture of this module we set the stage for life on earth by looking at the first half billion years of the earth's history to understand life in the universe we have to look as closely as possible at the one place we know of life in the universe where it exists on the earth astrobiology is speculating that life might be found on other worlds like the many exoplanets we've been talking about but earth is still the only form of life we can study so we look at it as carefully as we can and in particular we want to know how life arose on the earth in other words was life an accident a fluke a freak or was it an inevitable result of physical processes leading to biology at the moment we don't know the answer but we learn as much as we can by looking at the earth's history deep into time the deepest part of the earth's history is called the hadian era the first half billion years after the formation 4.54 billion years ago the planet soon after formation was a searing molten place originally with no atmosphere with no solid surface even because the rock was molten and the surface temperature was probably 450 degrees fahrenheit the atmosphere at that time was primarily carbon dioxide with some water vapor and some hydrogen the light gases hydrogen and helium were escaping into space and there was yet no atmosphere resembling the one we breathed today the conditions were indeed hellish and that's why we use hadeen from the greek underworld for hades it's important to recognize that we know very little about this era of the earth's history the first half billion years and that's because the earth is an active planet with plate tectonics and geology if you were to go outside no matter where you live and pick up a rock the typical age of any rock you might find is only going to be a few hundred million years it's quite difficult to find rocks even a billion years old and very difficult indeed to find rocks more than three or four billion years old in fact there are only a couple of places on the earth's surface where we can study hidean rocks and they include parts of western australia and southern parts of greenland so we're talking about an era where the physical evidence is rather slender however we have indirect evidence that something quite spectacular happened after the earth formed and after it had cooled and probably after oceans that formed in the atmosphere had formed and it's called the late heavy bombardment it's speculated that 3.8 to 4 billion years ago so a half a billion years after the earth formed the planets including the earth underwent a period of heavy meteoric impacts that's been called the late heavy bombardment it connects with an idea we've talked about in an earlier module where the chaotic solar system included the rearrangement of the positions of some of the giant planets wholesale migration or movement of the giant planets would trigger a large increase in the flux of rocky objects heading towards the earth and therefore an increase in the bombardment rate it's also theorized that a lot of the water on the earth arrived not only during its formation era when the earth was built from smaller pieces of rock but also in the light heavy bombardment when water could have arrived in frozen form on rocks from the asteroid belt or even further away at the moment the source of the earth's water the water in our oceans is somewhat controversial one theory holds that it was deposited after formation by rocky and icy material bombarding the planet this is called the late veneer theory but there's another theory not fully accepted by most geologists that the earth always had water deep in the interior in the mantle and eventually that rose up to the surface to become the oceans it's very hard to resolve these different ideas given the lack of physical evidence however lunar rocks brought back by apollo astronauts in the 1960s allow scientists to estimate when the late heavy bombardment history happened and that's because the lunar surface is unaltered by erosion or plate tectonics and so the cratering record does indeed show a spike in cratering at around this time just before four billion years ago also mars cratering history shows a similar spike although mars has had active geology in its past and the evidence is less clear in these case but the evidence for light heavy bombardment has been erased since that time of course by weathering and geological processes over time on the earth so we cannot use any cratering history of the earth to support this idea instead we have to look deep into the earth to the geology of the earth remember that the deepest hole humans have ever dug in the earth is a mere pinprick in the crust reaching tens of kilometers down the earth being thousands of kilometers across so once again inference is used in geology by the way seismic waves transmit through the planet and bounce across the planet and refract just as other waves might do through a bit through a medium so we look at the geology of the earth and it's the science that looks at the internal structure of the earth and tries to understand the history of the earth and the processes acting on it we've put together a pretty good geological history of the earth where the most uncertain parts are that first half billion years but we can learn a little about the potential for life on exoplanets by studying what happened on the earth when life was first forming the geological processes of interest on the earth and any planet like the earth are of course erosion which is when wind or rain or other processes loosen bits of rock and move them from one place to another on the earth with its wet atmosphere and its winds and its oceans driving water into the atmosphere and then back down onto the surface in the oceans there's a lot of erosion features are eroded on time scales of hundreds of millions of years but on that time scale entire mountain ranges can be degraded weathering is another process which is caused by changes in temperature that make rocks expand and contract and shatter them and essentially break them down from full rocks down to pebbles even to sand grains wind and rain and snow wear at the surfaces of rock continuously and while this process is imperceptible to us on human time scales on geological time scales of millions or even billions of years it again can dramatically alter the surface of a planet the final process that takes place is plate tectonics and that's the fact discovered about a half century ago that sections of the solid rock that make up the earth's crust are actually in motion it's not rapid motion i think the most rapid plate motion is something like a fraction of a centimeter per year but these plates are continually moving by these small amounts and over a period of time it can add up to substantial motion and create huge stresses at the interfaces between the crustal plates these plates collide they grind past each other they slide above and under each other and many of the most dramatic situations on our planet such as volcanic activity and earthquakes occur occur where this takes place there are incredible forces unleashed in plate tectonics and in crustal motions and these can completely transform the history of the planet and the surface of the planet the way it appears from space over time we think that all of these three processes will take place on earth like exoplanets we can look at examples of geological processes that take place on the earth in places perhaps that you're familiar with for example geological studies have revealed that the grand canyon was created by the colorado river eroding the land over millennia perhaps shocking to someone who's seen the enormity in the grandeur of the grand canyon is that its entire process of carving out deep chasms thousands of feet deep only took some millions of years not billions of years also near the area where i live the zion national park was a vast desert with sand dunes hundreds of feet deep a quarter of a billion years ago and in a place that i visited a long time ago in the northern part of ireland there are 40 000 columns called the giants causeway that are the product of an ancient volcanic eruption they have a bizarre hexagonal pattern that is due to preferential forces and stresses in cooling magma it's sheer evidence of volcanism at play in this island off the coast of britain the science of geology combined with radiometric dating which is the dating of rocks and materials by the rate of decay of radioactive isotopes within them allow us to infer otherwise inaccessible timelines this process of radioactivity is the key tool for understanding the geological history of the earth so we'll talk about it a little more in radioactivity an unstable heavy atom can change by spontaneously emitting an alpha particle which is two protons and two neutrons bound together from its nucleus if the number of protons changes the original element becomes a different element for example radium turning into radon only if only the number of neutrons changes the resulting nucleus becomes what's called an isotope of the original element the original atom is called the parent isotope and the new atom after radioactive decay is called the daughter isotope sometimes radioactivity from one state leads to another radioactive state so there can be a second stage and a third and even a fourth before a stable atom is reached so we have chains of radioactive decay but each radioactive transformation occurs at a steady rate the rate at which a particular atom decays is measured in half lives which is the amount of time it takes for one half of the atoms in the sample to decay this is a number fixed by nuclear and atomic physics and is invariant across the universe and certainly in the samples we've studied so measuring the parent and daughter isotopes in their ratios in iraq where we know when those ratios were fixed by its formation can lead us to age data rock by choosing the appropriate radioactive isotopes we can probe different time scales such as the billion year time scale or the few hundred million year time scale or the even shorter time scale for human civilization time skills we use radioactive carbon which has a much shorter decay life so the radioactive half life is the denomination of how long it takes a sample or a collection of radioactive atoms to decay intriguingly radioactivity is a truly random process in the quantum sense so if we stare at one individual radioactive atom we could not predict with any certainty or even at all when it will decay but if we have an ensemble or collection of a large number of those atoms we can predict with very high reliability when one half of them will decay the analogy is of a plate of popcorn or pan of popcorn burning on a stove if you do the experiment over and over again at a fixed heat level you can predict quite clearly how long it'll take for half the kernels of corn to pop that's the radioactive or popcorn half life but if you stare at an individual kernel you probably couldn't predict and you couldn't in practice when it would pop that's a reasonable kitchen analogy for what's going on with radioactivity consider the example of a material that contains an atom with a half life of one million years if we begin with 20 grams of that material after our 1 million years there would be 10 grams of the original radioactive material left and after 2 years there would only be 5 grams half of 10 grams we can use the radioactive half life of a particular element to calculate the age of matter that contains that element and this is routinely done and it's how we know the age of the earth is 4.54 billion years with a very short error or uncertainty in that of perhaps only a percent how far can we push back in the history of the earth by measuring rob samples in their ages an extraordinary discovery of a decade or so ago was called the jack hills zircon samples the jack hills region in western australia is one of the places where the very oldest rocks on earth can be found i've been there once a long time ago it's a brutal desert hot even in the australian winter and in the summer intolerable much hotter than tucson where i live the radioactive method was applied to crystals found in this jack hills region and the age of these crystals using the radioactive half life method was confirmed to be 4.375 billion years with an error of only 6 million years so these crystals formed in the first few hundred million years of the earth's existence these are these are tiny barely bigger than a grain of sand extraordinary samples of the very early earth soon after the crust actually solidified there's a critical detail provided by these very old samples of the earth's crust chemical analysis of these samples indicates that they were formed at a moderate temperature in the presence of water so the earth was not an unspeakably hot place when these crystals formed even though it was within 150 million years or 200 million years of the formation also that indicates that stable bodies of water or oceans or at least shallow seas existed at that time so we have from these tiny little samples of the early earth an indication that the stage had been set for life within 200 million years of the earth's formation again in a situation where there was no oxygen in the atmosphere would have been unbreathable to creatures like us so scientific analysis of these crystals shows clearly they formed in the presence of water and they were found embedded in sedimentary rock which also is deposited in a liquid in this case water sedimentary rock is produced when moving water deposits particles in an area over a long period of time the sediment is then compressed by geological forces into solid rock over millions of years so we are starting to piece together the geological timeline of the early earth and the zircon crystals tell us two critical details of the early earth that there were solid rock surfaces and water surfaces on the earth 4.4 billion years ago it's an extraordinary result because it indicates since carbon was available and energy was available that all the ingredients for life were present then so using radiometric dating in the science of geology we can learn about these almost inaccessible eras in the earth's history it's amazing that we can reconstruct the early history of a planet as large as the earth from a crystal that's smaller than the little nail on your finger so we have the geological timeline and if all rocky planets have a similar formation process then studying the geological history of the earth should give us an understanding of other rocky planets as well including those many exo earths that have been found around other star systems understanding the geology of the earth helps us to understand its history geological processes have changed the earth dramatically over its history due to processes of erosion weathering and plate tectonics we measure the early earth in terms of time by radioactive decay a physics process that allows us to measure the half life of atoms and then project that into samples of rock formed at different times radioactive decay decay is how we know that the earth is 4.54 billion years old with very little uncertainty in that number scientists have found rocks dating back from 4.4 billion years not rocks actually crystals that formed in the presence of water and that indicates that there was a solid surface and stable bodies of water within 200 million years of the earth's formation in other words the stage was already set for life [Music] you
