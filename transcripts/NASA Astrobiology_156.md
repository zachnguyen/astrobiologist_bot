[Music] hi I'm Marissa I'm a postdoc currently at NASA Ames Research Center and I work on microbial sources of Hope annoyed lipid biomarkers in different hot spring environments today I'm going to be excitedly sharing with you some new potential microbial sources of two and three methylhopenoids that we were able to find in some of our anoxic acidic and sulfidic hydrothermal Springs I want to acknowledge my funding sources which is oriu NPP program National Park Service NASA and finally Stanford University because some of this research was done back my PhD as well um so yeah you might be wondering if you are an astronomer or anyone but a lipid chemist what are hopeenoids and what do they teach us in modern environment why should we care so hopeenoids are cyclic triterpenoid membrane lipids so they're complex they're a little bit different from some of the phospholipid membranes we've been seeing today hopeenoids are some of the most abundant bacterial lipid biomarkers on Earth so they're very worthy of studying um they are important geologically um they can withstand the lithification process uh and all the diagenetic forces that happen when you are becoming a fossil um and so they're actually one of the few really strong sources through deep time of microbial inputs into the Rock record um and they can be detected billions of years after a deposition um finally in modern acidic Springs we observe methylated hopeenoids oh sorry in in this work we in modern acidic Springs observed methylated hopeenoids um and we found these in an anoxic environment where no cyanobacteria and no methanotrophs were present these are kind of the typified known producers of these kinds of biomarkers so it was exciting to find them at all and uh yeah the work that once we found those methylated hopenoids and the follow up work was able to lead to discovery of some new potential Source organisms for these lipid biomarkers um which if you are a biomarker nerd is always exciting and it's ever expanding so yeah this kind of new evidence of source organisms is important because uh these yeah kind of inoxic environments and knowing about them and the microbes that live in them today can have implications for us to reinterpret uh the sedimentary rock record on Earth but also potentially on mars or on other planets where we have a sedimentary rock record so my samples were taken in two sites one is in Yellowstone National Park and one is in Lassen Volcanic National Park um in both Springs you can see the mat is kind of similar there's a purple layer there's a like a acidic algae layer and then there's this white flocculent Elemental sulfur on top that's from the actual hydrothermal system itself um so what I did is I go into these Springs and I take samples and I go back to my lab and I extract for both DNA and for lipids and then from there I analyzed them so I found a bunch of different hopeenoids so I did a lcms analysis on them and so I was able to actually look at the functionalized extended hopeenoids and so as you can see there's a lot of colors on that graph every color is a different type of Hope noid uh that I was able to find in my Springs the green overlay on some of them and the pink overlays on some of them indicate a two methyl for green or a three methyl for pink so we found a huge diversity of methylated um yeah methylated hopeenoid compounds over to the far right you can see my controls we had pretty low diversity of methylated compounds so it was really interesting in the environmental samples to see so many different kinds which is what sent us on our DNA work um so the first thing that we did was do success amplicon analysis of our extracted DNA in that we didn't see any obvious sources or classical sources of those methylated hopeenoids which was pretty exciting so that then led us to go back and then do some metagenomics and then when we were able to analyze that metagenomic data we saw many potential sources um of Novel yeah 2 methylhopenoid producers um mostly anaerobic water and soil dwelling microbes but way more sources than are currently understood and this is just from looking into Hot Springs so a case for doing field work to expand our knowledge in the lab we also saw a ton of potential novel sources of three methylhopenoids these were also so these were mostly anaerobic and acidic environment dwellers that we found them tagging against and yeah it was pretty exciting so if you want to know more about either lipids or DNA analyzes or a microbial Ecology of these acidic Springs please come check out my poster later and find me I'll be at board 22 at this next session and also because I am in a room full of early career researchers I coordinate a division seminar at NASA Ames and we would love to hear you guys give talks so if you would like to give a talk at NASA Ames at any point please come find me at my poster and I'd love to write your information down and we would love to have you give a talk so yeah we're friendly [Music] [Music]
