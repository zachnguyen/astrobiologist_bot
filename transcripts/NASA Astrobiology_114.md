so in order for us to find a biosignature there are actually five stages that have to happen and all of them have to happen and in this particular order the first is life has to exist the second is life has to create some kind of a fossil that we can recognize and we can see as unique enough to be indicative that there was something going on there third that fossil has to be preserved immediately or very soon after its form the fourth step is that preservation has to continue for a long period of time and then finally we have to find it so it either has to be eroded or it has to be somewhere where we can look at a rock and recognize that there's a fossil foreign [Music]
