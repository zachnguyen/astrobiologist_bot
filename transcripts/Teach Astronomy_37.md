[Music] in this lecture we look at the context for life on earth in terms of the atmosphere and the oceans of the earth the first half billion years of the earth's existence were marked by tremendously powerful forces the bombardment by meteorites and other material from the inner solar system containing rocks and ices brought water and volcanoes spewed gases that built into the first tenuous atmosphere this atmosphere did not have oxygen the oxygen was produced much later by life the light gases hydrogen and helium escaped because they are the gases held less by an atmosphere or a mass of a planet that's a modest mass the heavier molecules get held better by the gravity during this time there were other processes that would serve to stabilize the surface in the atmosphere of the earth an important feature of the earth due to its metal core which has a molten aspect is the earth's magnetic field the earth's magnetic field is tethered in the metallic core of the earth just like a bar magnet and extends like a dipole out into space this magnetic field predicts the atmosphere from charged particles that originate in the sun in deep space these charged particles can react with and in the end destroy our atmosphere so the magnetic field acts as a shield to the earth later when life is formed the magnetic field also shields that light from high energy particles from the sun so magnetic fields in terrestrial planets or any planet are considered friendly for astrobiology or for the existence and persistence of life in the universe magnetic fields act as traps for charged particles so when a charged particle encounters a magnetic field the particle will spiral around the line and lose its potential to react with the atmosphere the solar wind is a kind of sea of high energy particles moving at close to light speed or relativistic velocities and any planet orbiting a sun like star will be subject to a solar wind in fact younger and more active stars have even more energetic solar winds so the radiation environment for planets near them will be even more severe water is obviously a critical ingredient for life because all life on earth includes water at least a third in the case of humans two thirds and for some creatures close to 100 percent life we think formed in the oceans so water is an essential medium for the combinations of chemicals that build up to biochemistry the first water was steam so within the first 50 or 100 million years after the formation of the earth when it was still molten and the rock was plastic or still moving there was no water no stable water because the temperature too high so we can imagine the earth surrounded by a cloud of diffused steam until the surface had cooled volcanic eruptions were also constant during this time and they contain some water vapor too from the interior but not enough to fill the oceans the current hypothesis even though there is deep water within the earth is that most of that water was delivered from the outer parts of the solar system by rocky icy material impacting on the earth most of those impacts of course occurred at the time of formation and soon after with an additional pulse coming at the epoch of late heavy bombardment because the late heavy bombardment is so uncertain at this point we don't know when most of the water on the earth was delivered however the zircon has told us that there was stable water before the epoch of the late heavy bombardment so we know that some of that water must have formed or stabilized as liquid within the first 100 or 150 million years after formation after the oceans had formed many volcanic eruptions occurred underwater and so the earth now and especially near its formation had many underwater volcanoes the chemical reactions resulting from volcanic gases primarily carbon dioxide mixing with seawater effectively scrubbed free oxygen from the air so there was very little free oxygen in the earth's atmosphere furthermore the rock cycle served to continually bond free oxygen to silicate rock further reducing the oxygen on the planet oxygen will also dissolve in seawater making it slightly acidic this process happens at the present day these combined effects mean the early earth had an essentially oxygen free atmosphere yet that was the situation in which the first life arose volcanoes had an important role in creating a habitable atmosphere because the first atmosphere was very thin and had no oxygen the volcanic eruptions enriched the atmosphere with ammonia carbon dioxide carbon monoxide hydrogen which mostly escaped because it was a light gas methane sulfur dioxide water vapor and nitrogen the nitrogen of course is very important was bound in rocks and released through volcanic activity because most of the earth's atmosphere in the present day is nitrogen nitrogen is not highly reactive so once it's formed in an atmosphere it tends to stay there whereas oxygen is highly reactive and so even a small amount of it would have disappeared or be continually interacting with other chemicals the atmosphere as it grew played a different role on the earth it protected the earth but it also insulated the earth about 30 percent of the sunlight arriving on the earth gets reflected off the earth's atmosphere on arrival the rest is either absorbed by the atmosphere or the earth's surface the earth then re radiates this absorbed energy when it re radiates the energy that comes in primarily be invisible light because that's the peak radiation from the sun it degrades this energy to longer wavelengths which represents infrared radiation or heat some of this energy that's absorbed by the earth's surface and then re radiated at longer wavelengths goes directly back out into space and so the earth is radiating infrared energy corresponding to its temperature a few hundred kelvin but much gets reabsorbed in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere these are gases that efficiently absorb or interact with long wavelengths of radiation and so essentially trap that radiation greenhouse gases in the earth and on other planets would be carbon dioxide nitrogen dioxide methane water vapor ozone and chlorofluorocarbons which is a trace ingredient similar to the gas used in refrigeration these chemicals are all emitted by volcanoes especially carbon dioxide and so this is what leads to the atmosphere trapping heat and the surface temperature rising beyond what would be expected at our distance from the sun this is a greenhouse effect this positive feedback cycle of trap radiation leading to higher temperature and so on when greenhouse gases re emit the radiation it is scattered randomly in all directions including downward where the temperature is already warmer so this cycle heats the surface of the earth to a higher equilibrium temperature than will be achieved without the greenhouse effect the effect of the greenhouse gases on the present day earth increases the surface temperature by about 15 to 20 degrees centigrade over what it would be with no atmosphere the greenhouse effect is then the recirculation of heat before it can escape from space this also has helped to regulate environmental conditions leading to climate stability on the early earth remember that the atmosphere of whatever composition acts like an insulating blanket buffering the atmosphere of the earth from temperature fluctuations externally we can see this in the seasonal variation of temperature on the earth in the northern hemisphere the northern parts of the earth's surface in latitude are pointed most directly towards the sun on june 21st the summer solstice and most directly away from the sun on december 21st winter solstice but if we look at the climate charts of countries in northern latitudes you can see very clearly that the middle of the high temperatures comes after june 21st by six or eight weeks and the median of the low temperatures in the winter comes after december 21st by six or eight weeks this lag is the buffering caused by the blanket insulation of the earth's atmosphere this is a very important effect for life because it stabilizes temperature fluctuations that might otherwise be too extreme for life and we think that the atmospheres of other planets around other star systems will operate similarly the object lesson of what happens if we let greenhouse gases get out of control on the earth particularly carbon dioxide currently a trace ingredient in the earth's atmosphere is venus venus is currently an inferno with a surface temperature of about 900 degrees fahrenheit extremely high pressure at the base of the carbon dioxide atmosphere 100 atmospheres and also with many toxic ingredients like sulfur dioxide ammonia even acetylene and hydrogen cyanide the surface is baked dry at that temperature obviously water cannot exist the small amount of water vapor is steam mixed in with the toxic atmosphere this is because of the runaway greenhouse effect that took hold we think two or three billion years ago if we run climate models back on venus which is otherwise a twin of the earth very similar in size and only 30 closer to the sun it's possible that venus was temperate and quite possible that venus was able to hold bodies of stable liquid water on its surface three billion years ago we would love to explore these distant worlds in more detail especially learning about their atmospheres their oceans their geological processes and study these planets or rocky bodies the same ways we can study the earth but it's going to be decades before we can land a probe on any place outside the solar system to study exobiological processes directly and we have to anticipate that although we found earth clones which is to say planets whose mass and size is very similar to the earth we have no knowledge at all of their geology their atmospheres their surface chemistry their history of weathering whether or not they have plate tectonics a long list of properties things we know so well about the earth we are completely ignorant of of almost all the exoplanets so these exoplanets might be wildly different from the earth the earth may not be typical in a sense but if we expect the geological processes are similar on all planets and some of these processes are governed by basic physics so they should be and that thermodynamic forces like evaporation and precipitation work similarly then we can make educated guesses about the conditions of an exoplanet without ever sitting foot on its surface or ever sending a probe there the atmosphere and oceans of the earth are important context for understanding the history of life on earth one earth ingredient that's important for this story is the earth's magnetic field which has shielded the earth from high energy solar radiation and protected the earth from the destruction of its atmosphere the volcanism of the earth caused by its tectonics and mass releasing heat from the interior driving tectonic motion is an important feature of the earth's history because it's led to chemical reactions so the release of gases that have enriched the atmosphere and actually to the scrubbing of some gases out of that atmosphere we think that underwater volcanic activity was very important in the first billion or so years of the earth's history we also see evidence on the early earth of a greenhouse effect greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane trapping radiation and raising the temperature of the earth beyond which it would otherwise have these gases and others in the atmosphere also act to buffer the earth from temperature fluctuations and that may be an important effect in stabilizing other planets making them more hospitable for biology
