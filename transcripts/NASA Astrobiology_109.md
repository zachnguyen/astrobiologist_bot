[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] friends fellow earthlings and those awaiting some of the knowledge that's bound up in materials in other worlds just waiting to be returned back here to Earth much like the words in ancient books being brought home from the library welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life I'm your host Dr Graham allow and we are of course brought to you by the NASA astrobiology program and Sega net.org as always we want to say a huge thank you to all of you out there who watch our show who reach out to our guests to myself to interact and ask all of your questions about the NASA astrobiology program about astrobiology as a field of understanding about this Quest that we have to understand what life is where it comes from where we're going we want to say a huge thank you this month to Dr Charles Liu of at luniverse for reaching out and sharing about our show in several places online we always appreciate that kind of support So if you want your own shout out on our show next month please share about our guests about the upcoming episode share your questions online we love to interact as much as we can to make sure that we're getting your questions to the astrobiologist that we bring on the show now today's episode is going to be a bit of a romp through astrobiology in a bunch of directions focusing in on one very specific realm of sample return we have joining us today Dr Lindsey Hayes Dr Hayes is a program scientist for the NASA astrobiology program the deputy lead scientist for the Mars sample return campaign and a program scientist for the da Vinci mission to explore Venus Lindsay's scientific background includes work on lipid biosignatures for things like mass extinctions evolutionary radiations and studying photosynthetic organisms in Hot Springs she spent time at JPL in the Mars program office where she was a sample returned science systems engineer and also worked on science activities for the humans to Mars program so thank you so much for joining me Lindsay and welcome to ask an astrobiologist morning Graham I'm glad to be here it's so awesome to finally have you on the show being so involved in the NASA astrobiology program but having so much expertise and experience throughout the realm of astrobiology from your own research to now helping others in their research and being involved in so many missions and Mission development before we talk about things like sample return and your your research in your own career I'd love to know what inspired you to become involved in this career in the first place what what was the thing that got young Lindsay interested in becoming an astrobiologist um so you know I think that the first thing to say is I I'm from Jupiter um and then and that actually means I'm from Jupiter Florida it's a little town sort of at the northern part of Palm Beach County but one of the really cool things that happened when I was growing up is um from Jupiter you can see uh you could see you can see launches from the Space Center from the Kennedy Space Center and so growing up uh Whenever there was a shuttle launch or anything like that you could go outside and you could see the the you know the trails from the Rockets and the lights from the rockets and that sort of thing and so from a really young age um it just was natural to me to think there are people going to space right there are people going to space all the time this is just part of our exploration and and Science and biology and all of those kinds of things I I always found very very interesting and so you know some combination of knowing that we were exploring space just knowing that it was sort of part of what we were doing um as a nation was really exciting and then you know getting involved with science fiction and reading a lot as a kid it was kind of a bookworm um and then you know I had a fantastic uh biology teacher in high school uh Dr Elisa Rayford um was a uh was the biology teacher she is now the the um the uh one of the um associate principals at the school that I was at um and just you know knowing that these are some fantastic things I was so fascinated by the concept of life elsewhere and how life evolved on our planet and what are the ways that we can understand those two things as they're linked well that's awesome you know seeing these lights in the sky reading great books to inspire you but also having great people in our lives is so inspirational when they really do help us kind of you know find those Pursuits for ourselves um so that's very awesome you did your undergraduate and your graduate work both at MIT and at postdoc at Harvard you you interned at JPL um I'm curious what the trajectory was that kind of got you interested in going from you know Academia into government and really being involved and now working at NASA headquarters you know when I was an undergraduate and graduate student at postdoc I was really lucky um to be able to work with some fantastic researchers and people who are who are and were really pushing the envelope about what we understand about life and how it evolved and such um and and while I was there I recognized that as much as I loved you know sort of being down and in and doing the science itself and you know being at the bench and being the first one um to see some result and know that you know I was the first person to sort of put all of these pieces together and understand this particular aspect of science um I also knew that for me um some of the higher level you know long term programmatic how are we going to do this what is this thing think Strat you know think strategically 10 years down the road where do we want to be going with this um some of that kind of work I found really exciting you know I really enjoyed um not just thinking about what's happening right now but sort of thinking towards the future making sure that we sort of understand how we got here and all of that sort of thing and so um it was actually my postdoc advisor at Harvard um Dr Pearson who you know suggested that if it was not my absolute passion uh to continue doing lab research uh then I explore some other options um that I think about you know what it would be like to work in industry or think about what it would be like to work in government and she really encouraged me to go out and talk with different folks and think about um you know some other options and I had an opportunity to to talk with uh Mary vojtek Dr Mary wojtek who was the um of course the the senior scientist for astrobiology um and she's you know she she said you know we have this great opportunity to serve as a NASA postdoctoral Management program fellow at headquarters why don't you come and see what it's like you know put in an application if you're accepted you know you can come work at headquarters uh with me and Dr Michael new who is the exobiology program lead and a astrobiology discipline scientist at the time and it turned into this fantastic fantastic opportunity to spend a year at NASA headquarters in Washington DC and I absolutely just fell in love with the kind of work that we were able to do and the again the sort of big picture thinking about um all of the different pieces that come together in astrobiology and all of the different things uh that are involved in that all the different researchers and topics and all of that I was able to uh work on the 2015 NASA astrobiology strategy the science strategy and that was just a fantastic opportunity to really get in and work with all of these scientists and think about the future so um you know a combination of not really being sure where to go some good advice um and you know and taking advantage of opportunities that that I was able to take advantage of I love that so much you know Carl Sagan once shared this old war song that says I don't know where I'm going but I'm on my way and it's always kind of nice to have that that trajectory of having an idea of where things could be but also kind of having no idea in the end and I do love hearing that there are other options I think sometimes for young people who are interested in careers in science and engineering they sometimes feel like you know the only directory is undergrad grad school postdoc Professor there really are a lot of directions you can take along the way and stem out into different fields and so it's always great to hear that there are other options and there are options that include working for the government and working for NASA yep you know and I'll say as a graduate student um that was the kind of thing that I I was really struggling to find and and sort of looking for those types of activities so yes 100 it's it's a good reminder that there's a lot involved in science that's not bench work or field worker you know modeling work and stuff like that that's bigger and broader absolutely now I do want to speak about your involvement in things like sample return missions um however before we get there I do want to speak a bit about your research and connecting your research to some recent activities uh myself being from the the Geo microbiology slash geochemistry realm for my own PhD research I had this you know experience when I first went to my field site I had spent many years reading papers about this this place in the high Arctic and then when I finally got there it was this very human thing happened it was a much different experience seeing the site with my own eyes and my own my own senses tasting and smelling and experiencing this realm it really made me understand the research in a much different way than I could with just pictures from satellites or from helicopters and aircraft and things like that and for you yourself you recently went along with the Mars exploration program to Western Australia to study things like stromatolites in Western Australia and these very old formations and that is tied to your own background in research I'm wondering if you can share your own human connection from your research to actually traveling to those sites with us yeah so um you know my my PhD work was in um it was in was trying to understand sort of the causes and the environmental effects um that were related to mass extinction events um but sort of while I was in that you know in that time as a graduate student um the the stromatolite uh let's say the debate about microfossils and and trying to understand exactly what we're seeing um and how we understand what uh what these ancient stromatolites and these other microfossils that are from Western Australia what they can be telling us sort of what they mean what they um what their significance is as part of their sort of understanding of the history um you know I this this trying to look back in time and understand what was happening um in these different uh in these different microbial communities and what uh types of things that were recorded from the ancient past um that then are continued into the future that we can find evidence of today that's really related to a a lot of the work that I was doing and this whole debate about these things was a real you know sort of active in the literature around the time that I was a graduate student and so being able to you know walk out to see um some of these stromatolites that are billions of years old to understand you know to have that sort of understanding of conceptually of how they formed and what they meant and why they were important um you know that that was something that that you know I could get from the papers and in the literature and talking with people who'd been there but actually being able to walk out in the field it was very rainy on the first day that we went out so despite the fact that it was a bit cool um and and quite radiant not very pleasant to be outside there was just this overwhelming sense of excitement that I had at being able to see and touch and and observe and really get a sense of you know this is what it is this is actually um the record this is how we understand what the history of Life on our planet is and how it and how it has changed over time and so that was just um it was just a really fantastic experience you know I love it so much yeah I'm super jealous I've not been to Western Australia to see some of these sites yet uh I do know with our NASA astrobiology YouTube channel there's a recent video created by Mike Toyon including the team who went on the trip called the Australian Outback and NASA's search for Life on Mars uh definitely worth a watch for our audience to see even more of the action going on in Western Australia we did ask all of our audience through a poll on YouTube before the show we gave them a few of the the formations that can be seen in these Western Australian sites and ask what the oldest were they had trundle locality the dresser formation and the meanthena member as possible options indeed it was the dresser formation for our audience that was the oldest even though that one didn't win the most votes uh it was 3.48 billion years years old at best estimates right now uh so not as old as the Earth remember that we you know the Earth itself is 4.56 billion years old but due to the Earth's Own Dynamic activities we don't have rocks that are as old as the planet on the surface of the planet outside of meteorites but there are ways of sampling things that are even older by doing things like sample return from other worlds and so Lindsay I think I really want to stress now a bit of one we can connect maybe Australia to things like sample return from Mars and how those things are are relevant you know like looking into the environment on our own Planet how does that help us to really understand samples from other worlds like Mars um that's a great question and and that also was one of the main reasons that we went to Western Australia um I mean honestly what it is is when we're thinking about the search for life we're thinking about astrobiology we're thinking about trying to understand what our planet's history was like and and what we might be looking for when we're looking for a life elsewhere um context is key right it is absolutely important that if you find something that you think may be indicative of life that may be a bio signature of some sort or another um that you understand where that sample came from um and what were the sort of looking at the geological context understanding from the other rocks around it where you know how that sample came to be there what the you know what the depositional environment was was the you know was the temperature or the other environmental conditions consistent with what we understand life to be um to be able to live in um was there anything that happened to the rocks after these these samples were deposited did they um you know were they subjects to sort of mountain forming events where there's these deep um temperatures and pressures and things like that that may have altered the features that we're looking at just sort of What Not only was the environment when those rocks were deposited um but then since then what has happened to those rocks and if you don't understand that context you don't really understand what you're looking at basically and so when we think about sample return as a way to understand or as a way to sort of um to to get at our search for life and NASA's search for life you really have to be able to collect samples for which you understand that whole history um and so you know the exciting thing about going to Australia was walking around and seeing these you know fantastic Red Rocks and these great you know these great green plants and these Red Soils and everything like that and realizing that you know this is a fantastic feature to look for stromatolites in that example um you know but if we were on this you know if we were in that place um you know imagine the plants are gone imagine it's just the Rocks you're driving around with the Rover how would you look for a section that would be useful for you to understand whether or not there were bio signatures in the in the area not just on this rock but in this whole area and so you know being there and sort of you know standing up on this hill having these fantastic uh you know these fantastic stromatolites at your feet looking around and recognizing that this is one of the few places in this area that these are preserved this well okay you know what what's different about this hill how would we have picked this hill out if we were you know driving around with perseverance or some something like that and so that that opportunity to be there in the field was a sort of additionally fantastic aspect about that work and be able to really think about uh what the value is um of that context I love that yeah context is key as you said for making those connections yeah and I I personally have seen this question a lot especially of late uh about sample return is you know why not just send better robots why don't we just send robots that can do the things that we return samples for I wonder if you can speak to that why is sample return so important for us yeah so so I think of this as sort of there's two answers that I often think about and the first one is a is a very simplified version and that is um when you go when you bring a robot um to space and you go to the surface of another planet or somewhere else um you have a lot of limitations on what you can do you have a lot of limitations on the power on how big the thing can be right because you need to launch it from from the surface of this planet um and there's limitations about the size of the rocket and stuff like that and so you know I think about it like when you travel somewhere right you bring the travel sized version of whatever you have it's not the full complex version um I used to liken it to like a hair dryer right you don't bring your full you know fancy hair dryer you bring the small little travel sized one um and so you have all these limitations of what you can bring um when you go to another planet because of because of those all of those things now when you go to another planet of course you have all of the rocks to choose from right any rock that you can get to you can investigate with with whatever uh spacecraft you have but when you bring samples back you have a limited subset of samples that you're bringing back so you need to select them very carefully but when you have them back here on Earth you can create a very careful and sort of iteratively designed process for investigating those samples and throughout that iteratively designed process right okay we learned this thing now what do we want to do next okay we learned this thing about it now what do we want to do next um you can bring to bear all of the scientific equipment that we have right now on this planet and all of the scientific equipment that we may develop in the future so you know you your samples you know when you send a spacecraft you have sort of an unlimited almost sampling capability but what you are do you know what you can do with those samples is very limited by what you've brought with you the inverse is true when you bring them back right you have the limited subset of samples so you do need to select them very carefully but once you've got them back you can you can or you can bring to bear anything that you can imagine and Design and create any of that scientific investigation to those samples and so it really not only expands um you know the value of those samples in the short term but in the long term it really makes it a much more valuable Prospect to be able to to bring all of that scientific knowledge to bear and I love that so much I love your analogy too of traveling with our smaller kit you know my my beard care routine when I travel is a much different routine than here at home um because of that nature of having more options for the kinds of instruments I will take uh into that game um so I love that so much and obviously right now A lot of people are thinking about how we're going to be using high resolution instruments of various kinds on some samples that just came back to Earth uh we just changed the number of Worlds we've sampled from and have returned uh successfully samples to Earth and you were in Utah this weekend for the osiris rex capsule returning and landing and bringing those samples back as a connection to Mars sample return I wonder can you make that connection for us and let us know what was it like to be out there and waiting for that capsule to come down safely oh well I'll answer the second question first it was absolutely inspiring and exciting and just really fantastic I mean um I've been lucky enough to attend a number of you know launches of different missions and such and and to me um that's always this awe inspiring opportunity I mean the amount of understanding that it has taken to get us there the amount of individuals the number of individuals who have contributed to every step along this process um is just you know it's it's a remarkable show of teamwork um you know sort of the desire to explore and to know more and all of that um I always get a little teary eyed at my launches and I and I did at the sample return as well because you know this is just I mean this is this is the exact exciting you know exploration thing that that you know that humankind has been continuing to do throughout the ages so it was just a fantastic opportunity um the connection to Mars sample return is you know hopefully we'll be doing this same kind of thing again um with with a few changes um in uh hope hopefully just about over a decade is when we'll be bringing those samples back from Mars so it was a great opportunity to sort of be out there see how operations work um you know really you know visualize you know this is what happens here and then this kind of thing happens and this is how the you know this is how somebody goes to the the place where the capsule has come down and these are the kind of checks they do and you know sort of every stage along that way and all of the different steps um that happen when we bring those samples back there's going to be additional things that'll happen with more sample return because of the nature of Mars versus bennu as a place that we're bringing samples back from um but just you know being there was this opportunity to sort of um really you know it kind of became real okay that you know my sample return is the next thing we're going to be working on so um it was a great opportunity and it was a really um you know just just exciting to be there no I love it so much I know a bunch of us who couldn't be there in person were watching online and sharing all over the interwebs uh and posting things actively in social media and so it was so good to see as always so many people sharing about these Endeavors and space exploration and the activities that NASA and other organizations are up to uh we did ask our audience another poll on YouTube um basically asking how many worlds how many celestial bodies uh have we sampled from and brought samples back to Earth uh interestingly most of our audience thought it was only three uh indeed the answer is six and there's even a little bit of hand waviness there for everyone watching uh one we have sampled from the Sun and so we count that as a Celestial body it's it's a star and so we have sample material from the solar wind itself we've also sampled Cosmic dust much of which should be coming from the Sun but also potentially outside of our own solar system but then of course we have many lunar samples brought back from Apollo the Soviet Union and more recently Changi III uh we also have things like vilt 2 a comet was sampled with the Stardust Mission uh Hayabusa and Hayabusa too were missions that sampled from two other asteroids as well and so bennu is the third asteroid we've sampled from and so in total we have six celestial bodies that we've sampled from and now with this concept of Mars sample return it might soon be seven and so I do want to speak a little bit about why we might treat those samples a little differently in coming back to Earth specifically and I'm sure you knew this might come up but there are some fears maybe from some people about bringing samples back from Mars I wonder if you can speak maybe to those fears and possible issues with returning samples from a world like Mars yeah so of course Mars is the first place that we have sampled um that we think had the potential to be habitable at some point um in its history right uh we don't really think of you know we are interested in in those other solar bodies as sort of a context setting again there's that word um as a way to understand you know all of the different processes within our solar system um but Mars is the first place that we will sample from where we think you know the whole point of of our sample return or one of the major goals of our sample return I'll say because there's other points too but one of the major goals is to understand whether or not um we can identify biosignatures from you know from past life that may have existed on Mars um just to be clear we we are not looking for extant life Mars 2020 Mars sample return we're not going there to try and find things that are alive today we're going there to look for the kind of biosignatures perhaps hopefully maybe um that we were looking at when we were in Australia right the kind of biosignatures that say there was life here in the past um some record of that life has been preserved and we can find those rocks and and understand what we're looking at so that's one of the goals of Mars sample return but because uh we believe that there was the potential that Mars was inhabited or habitable at least I'll say if they believe there is a potential that Mars was habitable in the past we hoped that it was inhabited um that we uh we are you know we share concerns and therefore we are doing everything that we can work on uh we are working very hard to make sure that we uh meet what we call the planetary protection guidelines now planetary protection is an internationally agreed upon uh set of rules and regulations um you know any any uh space faring Nation who is bringing samples back or or going to a place in the solar system has to pay attention to these rules they're called co spar these regulations help us understand um you know what how what types of things we need to be careful about um you know how much Earth microbes we can bring elsewhere um if we're bringing samples back what kind of you know things we need to be careful about and all that kind of stuff so as part of my sample return we are working on planetary protection and what we call backwards planetary protection that means bringing stuff back to Earth um and we're working on backwards planetary protection and we're thinking about um you know sort of multiple layers of containment multiple layers of you know keeping these can these samples uh isolated and in you know multiple layers of isolation as they're you know as they make their way back once we get them here on the planet you know sort of bringing them to a facility that's specially um you know especially designed so that uh not only do no do no um no material from within those samples leave um the facility um you know before we're able to do an assessment but also um you know we have to protect those samples it's sort of a two way contamination concern right we don't want anything from those samples to get out but because we're looking for life on these samples we also don't want anything from Earth to get on to those samples right the whole point is to look for biosignatures and if we find biosignatures of ourselves that kind of complicates the process so um you know that we're creating this facility that has these two way um you know contamination concerns and make sure and then we're also designing what we call a sample safety assessment protocol you know what exactly what this framework that we would think about you know what are we looking for um to to see whether or not we see evidence of Life past or present on these samples uh what measurements what we would we make how would we look at the result of those measurements how would we interpret those measurements to deem that these samples are safe that they don't have any evidence of any Martian life on them right now um and in the in the event that we you know that that that's a little bit uncertain or that we have any concerns we can always sterilize the samples before they're released for you know sort of for future work you know so we have sort of multiple layers of containment for these samples as they come back and then once they're back we would have multiple ways of assessing those samples uh for the potential of of problems or anything like that for the potential of any anything that we may want to be concerned about and then if that you know if we if if we return an uncertain result there we always have the ability to sterilize the samples um so sort of multiple steps along the way I love that so much it's good to remind people that if it's worth doing it's worth doing right it's worth doing well and making sure that we don't we don't do something foolish along the way and so you know we have these protocols for safety for planetary protection along the way as well and I also am glad that you mentioned that we're not really thinking about extant life necessarily you know we're not really thinking at the surface of Mars where these samples are being collected currently by perseverance in Jezreel crater that we're looking at living things in the near surface um personally a lot of us do think it could be possible there might be extant Life on Mars but maybe much deeper than the surface or kind of Hidden Away In Pockets but there really is a lot we could learn from these samples through sample return the big thing that was getting them back obviously and bringing them back to Earth and going through this whole process then making sure we safely interrogate the materials and learn more about them um before we kind of move into our own uh questions here from the faster than light segment and our audience questions which I see questions pouring in so thank you for our live audience watching right now please keep asking questions you before we get there can you give us kind of the structure of what sample returned from Mars it will look like what does it require to get those samples back here to Earth yeah so I mean my sample return is a fantastically ambitious campaign um you know the the first stage of course is happening right now right we have March 2020 that is on the surface of Mars in Jezreel crater um it is doing an excellent job of collecting samples and also collecting all of this additional information that will hopefully provide all that context that we're looking for for those samples you know so there's so that is happening right now in the current architecture that we're investigating and again Mar sample return is still early in development um and so we have sort of our current conceptual architecture but these are things that that may change as we understand more about how all these things work together there's a lot of new things that we're developing from our sample return but so the current architecture says that the next stage is to send two different missions so one of those missions is the sample retrieval Lander um that that mission would land on the surface of of Mars Mars the current idea and the hope is that by the time that that Lander gets to Mars Mars 2020 is still in operation and is able to drive right up to the Lander um and then the Lander has an arm that would reach that would pick up samples um and load them into What's called the orbiting sample container or the Oz right we like our acronyms right so the OS the Oz is about the size of a volleyball say right now we're hoping that it'll be able to hold about 30 samples so this uh the sample the sample arm picks up the those samples loads them into the Oz the Oz is then closed the Oz is part of What's called the Mars Ascent vehicle this is essentially a rocket that sits on that uh that Lander that rocket then gets thrown up into the air and launches and launches those samples within the Oz up and into orbit around Mars once that Oz is released in orbit around Mars the other Mission uh that was the you know the sort of second stage age will be there that's the Earth return Orbiter now the Earth return Orbiter like the sample arm is being built by our ESA partners and so the Earth return Orbiter would then rendezvous with the Oz on the earth return Orbiter is the ccrs the the the system that essentially will capture and contain that Oz that's being built with with NASA so with each of these two missions it's sort of the primary Builder is one of the of the agencies and the other one is sort of contributing so there's this great synchronicity to that so the the ccrs will capture and contain the Oz and then the whole earth return Orbiter comes back to Earth as it gets close to Earth it releases the the Earth entry system which is basically a big shell in which the Oz is considered to be right in the middle and that would then come in um to just about the same place that we were looking uh that we were watching the samples from bennu on osiris rex come in uh just two days ago um that would come in to uh where you know the current plan is for it to come into uttr the Utah test and training range then it gets retrieved on the surface and brought to you know this facility that we were talking about where that those first stages of curation and understanding what we have and really cataloging the whole set would take place so multiple different stages along the way multiple different pieces that are being designed that are sort of new and exciting there's a number of uh you know sort of Firsts within this thing right it's our first time launching autonomously off the surface of another planet it's the first in orbit autonomous Rendezvous between two different spacecrafts so there's just a whole bunch of really exciting things and so you know it's a complex process but it's as far as I can tell I mean this is the kind of thing that NASA does right this kind of let's do this whole thing let's do this so that we can make sure that those samples that we're selecting those scientifically selected samples have this this absolutely um extremely well outfitted Mars 20 20 perseverance Rover that's making all of these fantastic measurements in addition to collecting all these samples let's make sure that that we prioritize that aspect understanding that context is really important let's prioritize the scientifically selected aspect of samples um and make sure that when we bring them back sample Integrity is paid you know that we pay attention to that that we're not going to do anything along the way that would damage those samples so it's complicated but it's really exciting and I think it's you know it's the right it's the right way to do this I love it so much yeah complicated but exciting uh things are complex you know I'll admit back back when we first sent curiosity to Mars um I was kind of against the ADL system I didn't think the sky crane was gonna work it sounded it sounded too complex it sounded impossible yeah exactly um but you know if we think we can do it NASA Engineers will work their butts off to make it happen and I love that so much uh and so even though it's complex there's a lot we can get we can do to make it happen I've got to say I you know I I love the rocket backpack I think the the complex abl system is fantastic but to me you know and maybe it's just the age that I came up but you know the concept that we would land The Rovers before with the giant um the airbags to me seems even more audacious but you know just the we're going to take this Rover that we've spent all of this time and money on them we're just gonna bounce it along the surface I mean that you know the the the testing and the con you know the the creativity that the engineers bring to these sorts of things and then amount of testing that we go through to make sure oh yeah okay we we really genuinely think this will work I mean that's that's what NASA really brings right that creativity and then the follow through to make sure that you know yeah this is this is the best way to do it and so you can see it in all of the different aspects of MSR as well I love that so much yeah and for a moment I do want to talk you know a little bit about you as a person before we go into our audience q a and some other parts of our show here um you told me before the show that you enjoyed cooking and I myself I also love being in the kitchen I think cooking itself is a fun mix of science and art uh and I wonder what what things have you made in the kitchen have you really enjoyed kind of getting yourself into and making food yeah I you know I um I I used to work with a lot of chemists when I was a when I was a student I did a lot of chemistry work and and I know a lot of chemists don't like to be in the kitchen because they're like I do chemistry all day I don't want to have to come home and do chemistry but you know the exciting thing about cooking is it's chemistry you get to eat which is always nice but um you know uh last year um my husband's birthday and Father's Day were on the same day and so I thought I had to do something you know really go out loud um and I made a baked Alaska from scratch because that's his favorite his favorite dish and that was such a fantastic combination of you know temperature change and these change and you know using all of these different things it's this process you know created made three different ice creams from scratch and there was berries and there was you know all of this kind of thing and then making the meringue and then lighting the whole thing on fire um you know that kind of thing I it was just so much fun um I had a great time doing it it was just a really fantastic opportunity I'm always you know different types of roast meats and things like that I really enjoy uh chemistry and the kind of cooking that you do that involves you know sort of longer periods of time because you give these ingredients time to have these reactions and the result is always delicious yeah I love it so much I also do home brewing and right now I'm trying out my hand at Brewing kombucha for the first time and I gotta say I love like working with organisms that also ferment our foods and beverages it's so much fun to be connected to them the biology the science exactly it's a partnership in us making this delicious stuff that we consume um now I do have to mention this because I saw it online uh you were not too long ago a contestant on the game show the price is right and you won um what was that like um so it was totally wild we have some very dear friends who got tickets to the game show we went and uh you know did the whole process um and when they called I I genuinely was surprised uh to get called to come on down um but the whole process was you know it's meant to be exciting and it's meant to sort of you know encourage and sort of bring out the most excited nature in all of us um you know I had a blast I got to meet Drew Carey um you know I got to spin the Giant Wheel which to answer the question that always that everybody always asks it was exactly as heavy as a giant wheel you would imagine would be um but uh you know the the most exciting thing about it was just sort of feeding off the audience's energy um it was I you may not be surprised that I enjoy um that I enjoy that kind of thing and that I've done a lot of theater in the past so there was a point at it when I realized okay this is this is real you're on stage but it's not you're not acting as a piece you're you're actually here um and I you know one a whole bunch of fantastic prizes um but quite honestly the most exciting thing was I won a trip to Boston uh which I used to travel to Boston drive up to New Hampshire and officiate the wedding of two friends of mine um who I'd introduced a number of years before so there was a very sweet Connection in all of that and it was just the whole thing was exciting but knowing that you know there's sort of this continuation of that was really fun no that's so beautiful um let's treat our show a bit like a game show now just for a moment we have our faster than light segment these are just little short answers you can give us to a few of the common questions that people ask about those of us who pursued careers in astrobiology the first one comes from Enrico Fermi uh what is your favorite answer to fermi's question where are they I think I'm gonna have to answer like three pieces of answers right I think the answer is that some combination of um the universe is very very big right and we think about you know our planet our solar system is being big but you know we're a tiny tiny piece of a much bigger solar system so there's a lot of room right so where are they somewhere out there um that that's one piece I think you know most life is probably microbial not that easy to spot you know I think that there's a there's good evidence or there's good there's good reason to think um that microbial life is probably more common than more complex life and then and then the third piece in this puzzle I think is we haven't been looking all that long you know we in terms of you know human lifetimes we feel like well we've been going to space you know for for more than half a century now and you know we've looked at all of these things and we've seen all these things but really in terms of you know time scales um the universe is very old right so the universe is very big and the universe is very old um you know I think that that we just you know these little patience patience I think is the answer groovy um you mentioned at the very top of the hour when we first started the show that you were inspired as a young person by reading that you love books so what stories have inspired you to want to pursue a career in astrobiology you know when I was a kid in Jupiter um we had a great used bookstore nearby and it was like honestly it was right next to the movie theater and so anytime I was over to the movie theater I would always stop in the used bookstore um and buy at least one new book sometimes a couple new books but you know mostly Isaac Asimov also Ray Bradbury or Arthur C Clarke um I consumed a lot of Science Fiction um as a young impressionable you know as a youth um and and I think you know I it's hard to point to sort of any one story but just the whole sort of framework of Science Fiction as you know as a as a vision to the Future as a way to think about um what might be out there how we might go you know what all of those kinds of things how all of that fits together um you know I would sort of say all you know all of that was really my inspiration awesome well let's talk about inspiration and young Lindsay in the early parts of her career if you could go back right now to the beginning of your career and give yourself some advice what would you say oh that's a dangerous Prospect you're going to ask about time travel right before right after the science fiction question um no anyways I you know I think I think I would probably you know my dad used to have this quote and it was if you don't do it when you get to it you may never get to it to do it again um and and one of the things I said earlier you know I I have been lucky enough to have a lot of different experiences um and you know have a lot of opportunities that I was able to take advantage of um and and all of them even the ones that were not successful right even the ones where you know I didn't quite get out of it what I thought I was going to get out of it um really shaped who I am right there was always something I was able to learn or some new skill or something um you know so I would say you know just just keep taking advantage of those opportunities um you know I wouldn't want to change any of the things that I've done I wouldn't say don't do this or definitely do that instead or anything like that um but just you know do the opportunities that that you're lucky enough to take advantage of absolutely now given your roles at Nasa this next one will be interesting if there is alien life out there do you think we're more likely to find it from a world in our own solar system or on an exoplanet first oh I don't know if I can answer that one it feels like trying to pick trying to pick a favorite child right do you want to do you think it'll be more likely in the solar system or outside of the solar system um you know I I think that I think that either way there would be some really interesting um uh conclusions that we may be able to draw from those things um I think finding life essentially right next door um would really say something about the prospect for the amount of habitable environments there are within the Universe I think finding life somewhere else would say you know life originates multiple places all over the place you know wherever there is so I'm gonna say um I'm gonna say both are equally likely with the information we have today you love both children equally okay the fair I appreciate that now as I mentioned before you have several roles at Nasa you have a remarkable career um for our audience though what do you think is the best part of your job you know I this one is like very specific thick and a little bit cheesy um you know I actually love being able to send the funds out to researchers who have Awards with us right I love reading their proposals or their annual reports and seeing either what they're what they're hoping to be able to do or what they've already accomplished you know it's it's sort of it's sort of being able to you know to peek over the shoulder on the very Vanguard of the science and I think that is super exciting um and then one of the one of the benefits of being you know part of the government is I essentially get to buy science um on behalf of NASA and I just you know I think that's I I love that part of it it's it's it's kind of small and focused but you know this is this is The Edge and this is the the future and all of that so I actually that's one of my favorite things oh that's so awesome you know helping out the Next Generation helping out those amongst us who are our peers in the community that make great science and do great things pretty incredible um our final question and our faster than light segment is my favorite what is one science fact that still blows your mind you know this one I I feel like there are a lot of science facts that blow my mind so I'm gonna go with the biggest one right and that is the reminder that we are All Star stuff right that all elements come from stars um you know some significant percentage of that of the of the you know the larger elements um come from Supernova but that you know every piece of who you are um you know was processed in some star somewhere at some point I just think that you know that's that's a reminder that we're all part of something a lot bigger than what you know than just us or the work that we're doing or you know our our friends and neighbors and you know the connections they just continue going outwards from there and that you know this is I think it's fantastic that's wonderful well thank you so much for answering our questions for our faster than light segment we're now going to open it up to our live audience who are watching right now on YouTube and who have some questions we're going to start off with a question that was asked a little bit earlier by mohsin salashor motion wants to know why we're using nitrogen gas for the samples uh from orax from osiris rex and uh they wanted to know if maybe helium is a better choice and maybe we can connect this to MSR as well why would we use nitrogen rather than helium uh as an inert gas for protecting our samples so so one of the main reasons of course is that we we use nitrogen just to explain why we use nitrogen at all or any gas um is to sort of keep um is to sort of have an outward flow um you know prevent Earth contamination from coming in um and and one of the reasons that we are are most interested in using nitrogen of course is that there's a lot more helium in space um and so we don't we we want to make sure that if we're making some of those measurements um you know that that's protected so anytime that you make measurements you want to make sure that the compounds you're using um are not things that you want to measure along the way um when I was in organic geochemist um working in the lab you know we would try never ever ever to use Plastics because Plastics are very related to the kinds of compounds that we were looking to measure in these rocks so if you use Plastics on your samples you're much more likely to find the Plastics in the analyzes that you do um and so that you want to use compounds that you're not ultimately later on going to want to go back and try and measure all right awesome we have another question that came in rather early from Dr Jim pass Dr past wants to know in regard to sample return uh what more can scientists on Earth do in terms of analyzes that Rovers and satellites simply can't so you know the the easiest and quickest answer to this is um if you're familiar with a synchrotron right these are building sized instruments um and they're measurements that can be made with a synchrotron um you know non destructively and other ways um and other things that you may want to measure where you just you're never going to be able to put a building sized instrument onto a Rover or into an Orbiter and so you know those kinds of measurements those kinds of things where you know either you need something that's much much larger than you could put onto onto a spacecraft or something that um requires sort of nanomanipulation or something that requires um you know very small amounts measured in various precise ways or you know the sample needs to be held in a particular all of those kinds of things um can tell you a lot about the samples in ways that you know you can only get um you either can't get it all or you can only get you know much much lower accuracy or Precision with a with a spacecraft instrument that speaks to me a lot I've done research on three different synchrotrons on our planet and they are very large facilities now we can build benchtop sized particle accelerators in the future people have been working on it for a long time but even then you're not getting the resolution you get at these large facilities so that's pretty fantastic we have a question from zorazahir on YouTube who wants to know how debate about dating rocks impacts our interpretations of return samples which is a pretty good good question given How We Do date The Rocks currently on Mars yeah so I mean one of the most exciting things um for the Mars 2020 team uh was when they made some of the first measurements um you know investigated some of the first samples um from from Jezreel and realized that we were going to have access to some volcanic rocks um and because what that means is that we can hopefully start making measurements um that we can get you know that higher resolution that higher Precision when we get those samples back and be able to um do a much better job of dating that that impact event and as a result um you know sort of calibrating what we call calibrating the the crater counting curve right so the way that we date surfaces and understand how old surfaces are throughout the solar system um is by looking at how many craters of different size there are um within an area and that is a relative dating right things that have more craters are older and things that have fewer craters are younger because that's a relative dating thing we can kind of use it to understand a little bit about where the ages are of different units and such but if we have an absolute date this rock is this specific age it can help us sort of calibrate that whole thing right now um we have a calibrated date from the Moon um but we you know the more the more calibrated surfaces we have throughout the solar system the better we can make our estimates of other places in the solar system um so so you know the more measurements we make the better our estimates get and then you know and it can sort of build on from there fantastic uh we have a question that came in from Marina R which is what are the changes that bennu samples tell us not only about our solar system but other ones where it might be before interesting so I mean so the exciting thing about bennu is that it is a carbonaceous asteroid um that we that that is pretty old right and so bennu comes from a time um that you know sort of earlier than we saw um you know sort of Planet formation and all that kind of stuff and so the ability to understand you know that sort of pristine material for much much earlier in our solar system allows us to better understand you know some of those early processes um some of the things that were going on uh when our solar system was starting to form early on and things like that and to your question you know we until we started looking at exoplanets I'll say um we were pretty sure that we understood you know how the planets formed in our solar system and that of course the way the planets formed in our solar system was a pretty good analogy of how planets must form elsewhere in other in other Stellar systems we found a lot of exoplanets that indicate there may be other ways that Stellar systems may form and evolve um and so you know the more that we can learn about exactly what happened in our solar system the better we can sort of make you know take those models um and apply them to to evidence that other things happen in other ways so it's a really I mean it's sort of each piece of information that you have sort of starts to build on the other pieces and allows you to have a better understanding a better perspective um of what we know and and how we may be able to investigate the next things absolutely and just thinking about the Marina's question while bennu certainly is from our solar system it does make me wonder if in the in the distant future perhaps we'll have some Interstellar asteroidal or cometary material and maybe we'll build a spacecraft that can go out and Sample it even though it's moving extremely fast um sample return could one day be from the samples from somewhere else and that's kind of a cool idea as well now we exactly now we have a question from Washington the giant um it's an interesting question we spoke before about planetary protection with our MSR samples Washington just wants to know what the protocols are that we're going to be using for avoiding having things like melanized fungi to avoid having false positive biosignatures get into those samples we bring them back you kind of mentioned that structure before but I think for Washington they just want to know kind of how are we avoiding getting Earth material into the samples again I a great question and a really important one and one that we are you know spending a lot of tougher trying to make sure that that doesn't become a problem um and so like one of the things that so as I said before um you know sort of in the samples in the container that that they're we're planning to bring them back in multiple levels of containment those that sort of multiple levels of containment would not be opened um until we are in a facility that is particularly clean how do we know it's particularly clean well we have conversations with colleagues and folks across the government with other agencies other groups um that do things like you know run you know BSL for facilities these are the kind of facilities that um that we do you know we test pathogens and things in as you can imagine in those facilities it's very very important that we understand you know how material comes in and and material goes out so we use bsl4 facilities as well as um you know what we call our curation facilities NASA has a lot of experience making sure um that we keep samples Pristine from Earth content domination the com the combination of those two things right keeping the material for that's in from getting out right so that there's no concern about you know backwards planetary protection um and keeping Earth material from getting in which is still forwards contamination um there um you know both of those things together are the things that we're we have to think about from our sample return we have to think about in this in this facility um and that we're really working with um you know now designing all of those things so that by the time the samples come back it'll be ready and we'll have these facilities in place that's fantastic I will say so we're already close to the top of the hour we have a few more questions I'd love to get to if we have time here um there's one interesting question from Daniel Lapin I see here on YouTube wanting to know what's being done to develop as they say Frontier methods to apply the most advanced thinking creativity and such to analyze samples to maximize science output societal benefit and economic impact of these missions I will start off by saying Daniel if you're interested in seeing how NASA makes connections to everything that we do currently on the earth not just for our understanding of things like the climate and pollution changes in the atmosphere the ocean surface with Earth absorbing satellites there's something called NASA spin off that you can look up and NASA's been off for a very long time has been sharing information about the various ways that we we actually get a lot of Technology development and a technology transfer back from all of these NASA missions but Lindsay what do you think what are the impacts that we can see from things like developing better sample return missions well I mean so most directly right one of the things we're thinking about with Mars sample return is you know the potential for sending humans to Mars um there's a lot of information that um that that we can get from our sample return um that would be particularly useful uh for sending humans there things about uh the soil conditions right are there is there potentially anything hazardous in the soil condition or in the in the regolith um there on Mars things about you know could we use it as a you know as a protective material if we have humans on Mars um beyond that you know I think that there's there's a whole bunch of interesting aspects of this as I was venturing there's a lot of you know firsts in the Mars sample return campaign and so thinking about you know how we designed spacecraft to Rendezvous in space without you know without people driving them and things like that um you know thinking about to go back to humans to Mars um you know thinking about launching off the surface of Mars all of those sorts of things you know a lot of times we do exciting things in NASA not because because we say here's the spin off that's going to make it worth it in the end but rather you know this is an exciting prospect and you know we we do the new engineering Feats and the new technical development all that kind of stuff um not because of the spin off but because it's needed and then it's up to to other creative folks perhaps like yourself um to think about hey there's a really cool piece there that I can tie to something else that I'm interested in um so yeah so it's a it's a great point and you know NASA has of course had some really exciting spin offs um as you said Glenn absolutely and so we have two more questions here if we have time uh both regarding asteroidal sample return the first one uh from Shiva Agarwal wants to know how the samples from Hayabusa 2 are different from what osiris rex brought back so how are the samples from ryugu and bennu potentially different well they are different asteroids um but the answer is of course you know like we said you know being able to understand um you know slight differences um in those samples um and understand you know you know we sort of think of asteroids as you know monolithic they're all out there in the asteroid belt or there's some asteroids that are in other places um but you know but how we can understand those differences is a great way you know it starts to piece apart and and take those assumptions these are similar so therefore they must be the same and say okay but how are they different and what can we understand better because we can understand those differences and of course the Fantastic thing about Hayabusa 2 is that you know we have because uh because we were able to get some of the material from Hayabusa too we are also going to be um giving some of the material from orex to jaxa for them to work on um you know and it and also sort of you know speaking to the previous question you know it promotes Partnerships within science and science communities and around the world are lovely yeah that's the important part we are working around the globe scientists engineers artists creators thinkers doers dreamers to make all of this happen to learn more about our place in the universe and it really does take a global Community to make it all happen uh we have one last question that I want to cover here this is from Hendrick Holst on YouTube Hendrick wants to know if there is any material in that bennu sample that came back from outside of our solar system would we be able to tell the difference now I will say before I ask you to answer that Lindsay I'll mention to Hendrick to look up something called pre solar grains if you're interested in learning more there are materials that formed some of the early meteorites and asteroids in the early solar system that did indeed come from other solar systems other star systems from long ago from far away and the cool way that we know that is because of their Isotopes so we have a general isotopic composition in our solar system on our Earth that is fairly standardized across the entire solar system it's the same as our sun has uh of things like carbon 13 carbon 12 and that that that number is almost always exactly the same wherever you look there are small environmental changes that can happen but generally there's there's one specific number we find these grains that have wild ranges of those Isotopes telling us that they came from other stars that had different starting compositions of those Isotopes um but Lindsay what do you think of materials uh let's not say just bennu let's say materials from bennu or Mars or any other sample return how can we tell the differences between those materials that formed in place or came from somewhere else like outside the solar system and you know I think you've got you you hit right you hit the nail right on the head gram you know there are there are compositional differences isotopic differences that help us understand those things um you know I'll say that um you know those things are clearly um not as common right and so it would certainly be particularly exciting to find something like that I know that um you know they they're they're multiple protocols in place when you have these sample return missions that are sort of the oh my gosh this is a really cool piece you know some sidebar so you know this is where the sample goes and this is who gets to do this and this is who gets to do that but if you find an oh my gosh kind of piece there's a you know okay then this is how we we think about handling those pieces and the data that comes from that um you know I'll say the other thing I'll say is just you know anytime um that you go to explore you find something that you weren't expecting if you're doing it right and so you know I certainly hope that we find some exciting things I mean we we have seen evidence uh with some of our Rovers of things that look like iron meteorites sitting on the surface of Mars or other things that are exciting like that and so you know the prospect of finding these things is not is not nothing um but they're certainly exciting when we find them so you know I I you answered it really well but I'll just say you know I hope I hope we find something unexpected and exciting absolutely expect the unexpected and let's be excited together uh well Lindsay thank you so much for joining us for the show today we do have to wrap it now so for those who have questions uh still in the YouTube chat or watching the
