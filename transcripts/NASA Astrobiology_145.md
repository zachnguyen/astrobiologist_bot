[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] friends fellow earthlings and explorers of the unknown and welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life I'm your host Dr Graham the cosmo biologist Lao and as always we're brought to you by the NASA astrobiology program and saigonet.org a huge thanks to all of you out there in the in the internet realm who share our Show online on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and Linkedin and all of the other cool places where you can share about cool science online as always we want to give a shout out to one profile that's been very active in sharing about our show asking questions about our guests for this month's show this month we want to highlight the user are at astrobio buzz on Twitter this account's been fairly active lately and sharing and talking about astrobiology topics and so a huge thank you to Astro biobuzz on Twitter for sharing about ask an astrobiologists engaging with me with our guests it's a pleasure to have all of you tuning in for our show every month now today's episode is going to be pretty remarkable I've been wanting to have today's guest on the show for quite some time so I'm glad we can finally snag just a little bit of her time to have her chat with us today's guest is Dr Lena Vincent she is an experimental astrobiologist who earned her PhD in astrobiology at the University of Wisconsin Madison where she was studying the chemical origins of life she was also a fellow of the future investigators in NASA Earth and space science and technology or the finest program after finishing her PhD she then went on to become a NASA post doctoral fellow at NASA's jet propulsion laboratory or JPL uh at JPL she studies how Signs of Life might be preserved in the icy ocean worlds of our solar system like Europa and Enceladus and how we can use instrumentation uh here on Earth and in the future on astrobiologically focused missions in space to look for those possible signs of life or bio signatures she's also an avid science communicator and has garnered over 500 000 followers across social media and sharing about her life her interests and a whole lot of astrobiology uh she's also into some really cool things like scuba diving and chasing aurorae and we'll talk about that in a little bit but first Elena Vincent thank you so much for joining us for asking astrobiologist well thanks so much for having me I'm really excited to chat with you awesome like I said I've been wanting you on the show for a long time uh we've been following each other in the internet realm for a while in social media it's been very cool to see your growth as a science Communicator as well as as a really great researcher in astrobiology before we jump into your research background though and what you're currently working on uh one thing I love to ask of our guests is what got you interested in science in astrobiology in the the realm that you've been pursuing in your life what was your science origin story well uh it actually is a little bit surprising I did not know that I wanted to be a scientist until a little bit later on uh in my childhood so I was not one of those kids that you looked at and went oh that's she's going to be a scientist for sure um in fact I went a lot of my childhood thinking I couldn't be a scientist because I wasn't very good at math so I was really struggled with math when I was in middle school and high school and because of that I was kind of deterred away from doing science unfortunately I didn't really listen I sort of fell in love with science through marine biology interestingly so I got to participate in an internship when I was in high school approaching college application time and I got to do some marine biology experiments with the Shedd Aquarium and that's what's sold me on doing science so I pursued a degree in initially marine biology at Cal State Long Beach and then I switched over to General biology because I I realized and through my coursework that I just love biology in general and I kind of stuck with that course until pretty late in my undergrad actually as a postback I was doing some research at City of Hope Medical Center I'm out here in California and thinking about grad school and what I wanted to do and realizing that there was a whole world out there of different things that I could study and I happened to cross the NASA astrobiology Institute website incidentally uh and my world was just brought uh I had no idea that astrobiology was a thing and there it was you know this website and not only did astrobiology exist NASA was excited about it um and so I haven't looked back since I decided right then and there that's what I wanted to do and that's how I discovered astrobiology kind of by accident through a Google search I love it so much and honestly marine biology is like a Gateway Science for so many people I also love marine biology I was an intern at The Graduate School of oceanography I off I often talk to other people who've pursued various Realms of astrobiology who started off in that realm and so maybe in some ways wanting to know what the alien life of our own oceans is like kind of leads us towards some of those ideas but then in your Graduate Studies you were studying more in the origins of Life the chemical origins of Life can you explain to us a bit more about your graduate research and what you were pursuing and trying to understand how life begins yeah so I was very lucky to be part of a super exciting project that started right when I started my PhD at the University of Wisconsin Madison my advisor was a botanist named David Baum uh who had just secured funding from a program run by NASA and the NSF to do high risk science uh for solving the origin of life or at least part of the mystery of the origin of life uh and so that was super exciting and basically my role in my PhD was uh testing out an experimental procedure to validate a model that they'd come up with for the origin of life and that model was pretty simple it was that you could get the processes of life on things like the ability to grow and reproduce and evolve in systems of chemicals in the absence of life and so we had a whole sort of scenario for how that might happen that involves mineral surfaces and mixing those with chemicals and then eventually getting these kind of self perpetuating evolving chemical networks which is very cool and very risky um you know it's basically just mixing a whole bunch of stuff together in a test tube and then looking for these lifelike processes um and so that was the the bulk of my PhD it was was developing that procedure and then implementing it to look for signs of these lifelike chemical systems as we call them um to understand how life originated which we are still clueless about at this point yeah absolutely we don't know if life started on Earth or elsewhere and came here we don't know the process and maybe Evolution itself was just throwing a bunch of stuff together and seeing what happened um so that's really exciting I will say I don't know exactly when you and I first interacted online or in life but I do remember you kind of helping to put together and lead the ulala Symposium at UW Madison um I wonder if you can explain for our audience what that was is uh and your role in developing that Symposium for bringing together astrobiologists to talk about their research yeah so uh while I was at UW Madison I took advantage of a grant program that was at the University to fund Outreach programs and specifically to highlight women in stem and so I applied for the grant and I thought it would be a great opportunity not only to bring attention to astrobiology on the UW Madison campus which was still relatively unknown at the time it was pretty small we only had I believe one or two um kind of research efforts at UW Madison in astrobiology but also highlight um some some women in the field who I thought were doing absolutely incredible work so we got funding to bring four scientists to campus kind of across different disciplines Under the Umbrella of astrobiology who came to give talks to the public but then also interact with various departments at UW Madison just to bring exposure to the field and you know let people know let students know in particular hey this is something you can do you know this is an area of science that a lot of people aren't aware of and it's really exciting and if it's something that interests you here are examples of scientists who are doing some really groundbreaking work in that area so that kind of launched the Oola initiative at UW Madison which was an extension of that where we sort of Consolidated all the astrobiology research that was happening on the campus which was growing and as it continues to grow on the campus and also do Outreach and spread the word Beyond just the Wolves of UW Madison about the work that's being done there I love that so much it's so important for representation for inclusion for people to see people who look like them from various Realms including lots of the amazing women who are doing incredible things throughout astrobiology and all the Sciences involved in our quest to understand life and I definitely want to come back to science Communication in just a minute and using social media for instance the share science but first I want to talk about your current research you are now at JPL which might be like the mecca of space exploration for a lot of people it's a pretty cool place um I wonder if you can just share with our audience your current research at JPL and what it's like being a NASA postdoc yeah it is super exciting it's always been my dream um so it's still kind of surreal for me to be there um but yeah I am part of a really amazing diverse team that in general our goal is you know if we imagine project into the future that we're able to send a spacecraft to the outer solar system uh to one of the icy moons um say Europa the moon of Jupiters or Enceladus the moon of Saturns and we can land there and reach the surface maybe go a little bit below the surface and look for signs of Life there how would we do that if there are signs of Life on these icy moons on the surface what kinds of instruments would we need to send up there and what would they need to do what would they need to look for as definitive Signs of Life and so that the way we're trying to answer that question is by simulating aspects of those environments so we know that they're very very harsh in a lot of ways so they're very cold first of all um but they also are exposed to various kinds of radiation and lots of it and we know that biology right the structures of biology really don't do well in those environments and so the question is you know if if those exist there would be would they be detectable uh will they be altered by the radiation and is that something we need to take into consideration when we're designing these missions and so you know recreating those aspects in a laboratory is super important so we have a variety of vacuum Chambers with electron or different radiation sources including electrons ultraviolet light and we basically blast various things including full cells with that radiation at various temperatures and look at what comes out the other end to make sure that we're able to detect them um and so yeah that's basically what we do we just Blast Off with radiation and then do a whole bunch of chemical analysis to figure out what kinds of biosignatures we should be targeting very cool and my own research in the past I had a chance to go to board Fjord pass in the high Arctic to a site where fluid is moving through a glacier and depositing material on the surface providing for us a way to see to see how biosignatures are preserved on the surface of a cold environment we have similar environments in Antarctica with blood falls in the Taylor Valley there's a lot of cool environments around the earth that we can look at but I wonder if you can just share with our audience how different the environments are at the near surface of Europa and Enceladus compared to the things that we find here on Earth yeah so those are great analog sites and there are lots of them but I think the big big difference probably I mean there are a lot of differences you know the Earth and these moons are different in other ways both in size and where they are in the solar system and all that um but I think the radiation is the big thing um you know Jupiter um you know that Europa orbits is producing a lot of ionizing radiation so these really high energy particles they're basically just punch through um biological molecules and create a lot of damage um there are there are some forms of ionizing radiation that affect us here on Earth but um the story is very different around Jupiter and so any life that exists that there would have to contend with this very aggressive very strong form of radiation so that's one one huge difference the other big difference that also plays into this is the presence of an atmosphere um so Earth here we have an atmosphere which among other things does protect us quite a bit from radiation um that is not the case on the surface of your open en solidus um it may have a very very thin what we call exosphere but it's very marginal and it doesn't do much in the way of protecting so um those are the big big differences and and they do matter a lot when we're thinking about biosignatures and how well they would be preserved in those environments when they're dealing with these really really aggressive forms of radiation absolutely and that's a great segue to the poll that we put out yesterday for our audience we asked people what might be the biggest challenge in their own view for finding Signs of Life at or near the surface of a world like Europa we gave them the options of freezing temperatures of the high radiation or a lot of salt in that environment the very low pressure or low water activity and more than half of the respondents did say that it was radiation that they thought would be the biggest issue the next largest uh almost 25 percent of those respondents said the freezing temperatures were an issue for finding possible signs of life and and maybe they were even talking about active life and I think we should you know differentiate we're not looking necessarily just for active cells at the surface of Europa but looking for signs of of life's activity um past or present um and so that's kind of interesting we did have one person respond to that they they weren't aware that these were possible issues and so it's really important I think to share that these are very different environments for us to explore now you've mentioned you're using these these test Chambers to kind of recreate the biology we create the biosignatures we could look for what kinds of biosignatures are you looking at right now or are you throwing in like active live organisms and then seeing how they might produce signatures in that environment and so the answer is all of the above so we're sort of casting a pretty wide net um so obviously one of the things we're looking for the the stuff of life right the molecules of life so what we call chemical biosignatures you know so you know if if there were an organism at the surface that's bombarded by radiation you know maybe it wouldn't be alive but it might leave behind traces of its presence that we can go in and detect after some time um so we are looking at those so we're looking at different types of macromolecules so for example amino acids lipids um nucleic acids so all the things that cells tend to be made of we are targeting we are also looking at cells themselves and that is a big part of the work that I'm doing right now is not just these chemical bio signatures but actually the cells themselves um do those provide a protective effect you know are we more likely to detect whole cells and we are these chemical biosignatures which might be much more sensitive by themselves um so yeah so we're kind of looking at both whole cells um and then also the the biochemical biosignatures they produce oh that's so cool uh I will say so a chemist uh Dr Ian Miller reached out to me on Facebook earlier today and he argued that it's not possible for life to start in Europa or Enceladus in Ocean worlds we've heard this argument from others um there are some who've been on the show even who have the hot spring hypothesis for instance um suggesting life had to start on a dry environment here on Earth one of the arguments for there not being potential life on Europa Enceladus has been a lack of phosphorus or at least what we thought was a lack of phosphorus a paper just came out today and was shared by the NASA astrobio Twitter account where they found signs of phosphorus salts in the e ring around Saturn coming from Enceladus and so I guess just for a fun personal question for you do you think Europa or Enceladus is more likely the better Target to go to right now for us to look for possible signs of life especially now that we have evidence that there is phosphorus in the the encelada the the Saturn e ring well so I I have an answer but it's not based on whether or not I think I think life is more likely to eat because my I have a blanket answer for that and then say we have no idea what life needs even here on Earth um it's impossible right now for us to disentangle that history uh and and say it with certainty you know life can only develop with this kind of environment with these specific things um that is just not we're just not in that place and there's good reason to think we'll never be in that position um on the other hand we can say you know maybe life can arise in lots of different places as long as long as it has a bare minimum so I'm going to be optimistic and say that life could arise anywhere um that has the right ingredients and right now it seems like both Europa and solidus do so let's say that that's even chances on both um I would put my money on Enceladus right now only because um looking at the structure of these moons and their Interiors we think that if life exists it probably does well below the surface far below where we're able to access right so we're talking about drilling through kilometers of ice and that's just not something we're able to do technologically right now um the nice thing within solidus we know sort of for sure is that there are mechanisms by which material from the subsurface come up to the surface through these kind of geyser like mechanisms that may also be the case with Europa still figuring that out Clipper next year will have well in a few years will help us figure that out um but just because we know that there is this mechanism by which stuff from the subsurface comes up um we might have a better chance of sampling that material and therefore detecting signs of life if they exist so I'm going to put my money on Enceladus but not because I think it has a better chance of having life in Europa because I think we have a better chance of detecting it I love that yeah yeah Solace is just spewing possible biosignatures and the space for us to go fly through and look at we need another mission and soon I do want to change gears a little bit now to talk about your presence on social media and all of the communication that you've done you've grown a rather large following across many different social media platforms your user handles are at astrobiolina for those who want to follow you in various places um what was the the structure for you to kind of get engaged what drove you to share so much science through social media yeah so actually didn't start through social media so um you know the first few years of my PhD I did a lot of Outreach and science communication through what I would call more traditional platforms right so in person speaking to the public schools churches retirement homes uh and the jump to social media really didn't come until uh after the start of the pandemic when we saw some of these new platforms arise people were turning to social media for a lot of entertainment I was part of that group uh and actually you know a year or so into it so say in the summer of 2021 I kind of happened across this whole new realm of social media which was education right education on social media sharing educational content whether that's cycom or something else you know balancing a budget uh using a Lightroom or some kind of software and I it really hadn't clicked to me that social media could be used effectively for cycom until then and so I kind of on a whim through my hat in I created a video actually had nothing to do with science at the time it was how to use PowerPoint to make a good presentation and I kind of blew up and I rode that wave for a little bit and then when that sort of came to an end I was like I wonder if people would be interested in my science in astrobiology and I didn't know of a lot of people doing uh astrobiology cycom in that realm specifically on things like Tick Tock and Instagram reels uh and so um yeah I kind of capitalized on that made some videos and sort of took off from there so that was my entry into cycom on social media I love it so much now in the realm of science communication for those of us who have continued pursuing our research careers while also sharing science we do have that issue sometimes that we butt up against of especially amongst traditional academics is this idea that if you're sharing science actively and you're pursuing that role that you can't be a good researcher at the same time and sometimes it's referred to as the Sagan effect there were a lot of people who felt like Carl Sagan putting so much time into writing books and and producing Cosmos wasn't also doing effective and good research have you noticed that kind of that kind of dichotomy that some people have viewed that you're doing good science communication so you can't be a good researcher and if so how have you kind of dealt with that struggle I have and I also point out that there is the opposite problem so I am a Scientist but um you know I have a lot of colleagues and PSY Commerce who are not career scientists and they also receive a lot of criticism saying you know they're not scientists so how could they possibly you know be respected in in cycom and deliver effective cycom and I think all of that um is is not true right I think I do encounter the the opposite right the fact that um doing so much psychom and being so active with the public means that that's taking away somehow from my abilities as a career scientist and I've just not found that to be the case certainly in terms of time and effort right you have to make time there has to be time to do both of those things and that is a bit of a balancing act but I would argue that we have that Balancing Act regardless of whether or not we do cycom right balancing life and and the work is is a challenge that's pretty Universal um but yeah I think as long as as you can find the time and it's appropriate and it's and it's balanced I really don't see how they're mutually exclusive in fact I've found in my experience that both of those things right my um my career as a psy commer and as a scientist have mutually benefited from each other and have really made me better in both of those cases so I do definitely encounter that but I think that's starting to wane a little bit as people really see the value of cycom and the value of having actual career scientists contribute um so yeah yeah absolutely and I I personally I've noticed a lot more amongst you know younger upcoming early career researchers tend to see more of the value than we traditionally have in sharing our science more openly and and doing more Community engagement and being part of their community and sharing and I love the idea of your science communication kind of improving your science it's just like you know reading a really good article and then talking about it with somebody else is a great way to understand that research and if you're talking about it with you know a half million people that's a much different way to talk about the research um I do want to jump into a few things you've been sharing lately um of your interests but before I get there just a reminder for our audience watching live you can ask your questions right now in the chat on YouTube for Dr Vincent and we will get to those questions very soon I promise but there are a few more things I want to know about uh first off of late Lena you've been sharing a lot of really cool stuff about scuba diving I've been kind of nerding out as a diver and someone who loves the ocean World especially marine life over all of these incredible videos uh I wonder if you can just share your journey as a diver and all these incredible things you've been doing with us yeah I'm I'm so excited to talk about it so it's a fairly new Venture for me um so it's funny it's also kind of coming full circle because as I mentioned I got my interest in science through the ocean to marine biology so it's been really fun to kind of close that Loop and come back to it so I scuba is always something I wanted to try but either just didn't have the time or was a little bit apprehensive about because it is kind of scary uh or just didn't have the funds because it is also a pretty expensive hobby it turns out um but last year in October I decided to go for it I'm here in California now there's great diving out here got certified kind of as a thing I thought I'd do as a as a hobby on vacation sometimes and yeah I was wrong about that I felt completely in love and um realized that there's a whole world of diving that incorporates science right so there's scientific diving this is something I was not aware of until fairly recently um so you can actually get certified to do science and contribute to research projects underwater with Scuba and so now that I know that that exists I'm looking for ways to kind of meld my skills as a scientist and as a diver and so I think diving is is very quickly become a big important part of my life but even just as a hobby uh you know I and now I look for any opportunities to dive um anywhere I travel uh is kind of right on my on the top of my list is look for a place to scuba uh and that's been super fun so yeah definitely if anyone's thought about trying it and isn't sure you should try it I love it yeah absolutely it's so incredible and there are different Pursuits in diving that people can go after like cave diving and other aspects of technical diving wreck diving all kinds of cool things that you can do if you're interested and you're okay with tight spaces for some of those um I will say so like you know many NASA astronauts to my knowledge all NASA astronauts have been certified to be divers that underwater environment is important for those who need to experience kind of neutral buoyancy but also kind of a more you know extreme environment you know where it's a little bit more scary kind of pushes the human body to a limit you are forced to rely on apparatus like scuba and I wonder for you uh in your own thinking of like training for astrobiology for the future do you think it'll be helpful for young people who want to be astrobiologists to experience the underwater environment will that help them think more about possible alien environments absolutely I mean one of the things that you mentioned right this neutral buoyancy first of all I think it's just such a a unique experience that you really don't get to do unless you go up into space right um and so I think just being down there and really kind of pushing the limits of where we can go as human beings right with the assistance of these kind of external gas sources uh I think absolutely puts things in perspective um and certainly for astrobiologists that are sort of exploring the limits of life and how weird it can get the underwater world is a perfect example of that and it's a perfect opportunity to reflect on that and really be inspired by the weirdness of underwater creatures so yeah I think there's absolutely benefits for people who are considering ashbiology but I think just in general as a person right as a human being um just kind of getting outside of our our comfort zone which tends to be on dry land uh can be super beneficial and I highly recommend it awesome I love it so much um one more question then for me before we go to our faster than life segment you also in your own social media your life you've been chasing aurorae you've been watching storms actually I know that if there is a solar storm there's a good chance you're gonna post about it on Twitter and I can follow along and see what's going on um I wonder if you can speak like what what is your your interest what's your fascination with space weather that's driven you to chase some aurorae yeah you know I actually don't really know where it started I think I've always been really interested in weather in general so severe weather so um you know I haven't lived in a lot of places where we have severe weather things like tornadoes and big fish severe thunderstorms but I've always been fascinated by them I love clouds I love the the kind of impending doom aspect of it I don't know what it is I love watching storm chasing shows uh so and I've kind of made a hobby out of tracking those severe weather systems even if they have nothing to do with me geographically and I think that sort of spiraled into just space weather um you know the this amazing phenomenon we have here on Earth at the Aurora um these beautiful light displays that we have and the fact that they originate from the Sun uh and interact with our magnetic field I think is so elegant and so cool and so beautiful and I've gotten to see the aurora now a few times uh I actually went to Alaska last year as a post graduation trip uh for myself and got to experience them in a way it hadn't before and um again another thing I would recommend for people if they have the opportunity to go witness because it is really life changing um but yeah that's that's where my interest in them came from I love it so much yeah it's so cool um just that connection I love that you pointed out this is connecting us to our star in our own solar system and it's always fun I think one of the best things of exploring astrobiology and space science is becoming of how they're becoming aware of how connected we really are to everything um and so thank you so much for sharing all of that I do want to get to our audience questions but first we have our faster than light segment so really short answers kind of just some fun questions that we like to ask of everyone the first one comes directly from me because I nerd out over it um with this idea of the Fermi question or Fermi Paradox so for you Dr Elena Vincent what is your favorite answer to fermi's question where are they oh well there are a lot of potential answers but the ones I tend to favor are the ones that really highlight how little we know and that oftentimes we might be looking for the wrong thing and in the wrong place so there are a number of different ideas about the fact that you know these these civilizations these alien civilizations that they exist might very well be transmitting they might exist they might be trying to make connections with us but we are not looking at the right thing we tend to be looking for radio signals um you know maybe they're using something else whether that's neutrinos lasers or something completely different that we just cannot conceptualize right now because we know so little about everything let alone other civilizations if they exist so that tends to be my favorite answers we have no idea what to look for I I love it so much that makes me think of like gravitational waves and like more kind of out there physics Concepts and cosmology and how aliens might be like shifting around neutron stars and sending messages there's so many things that could be happening out there and so for myself I'm a huge fan of Science Fiction I've always learned that over Star Trek Star Wars I wonder for you what stories have inspired you to want to know more about the nature of the universe so definitely science fiction I am a huge science fiction nerd if you can see the books in my bookcase you'd see about 90 of them are sci fi um so I definitely get a lot of inspiration there I think it's been such a powerful tool for imagining just how weird life can get that's really kind of the only tool that we have right now that allows us to kind of Envision fully what life might be like elsewhere um I had one that I just recently reread that's one of my favorites is a short story called story of your life by Ted Chung which inspired the movie arrival which is also a fantastic film it's an even better short story in my opinion so definitely sci fi but also like we were talking about earlier um the ocean and how weird life can get um I think just just pushing the limits the boundaries what we think is possible in terms of shape and Physiology and how weird things can get really inspires me to think about how weird they could get elsewhere um so yeah life on Earth I love it I actually just finished stories of your life and others last night for the second time it's a great short Story collection he has a new short Story collection not that I have not read yet so I need to jump over to that next I think um so right now where you are in a career I mean you're very successful you're now a postdoc at JPL doing remarkable research you've had some different research along the way you mentioned that you started off kind of interested in Marine Biology but I wonder if you could go back to the beginning of your collegiate career your academic career and give yourself some advice what would you say I would say that being an expert in one specific thing is overrated uh you know obviously having experts and expertise is super important but at least in terms of being something to strive for I've really learned that there are much more important things you know I used to have this Vision that to be successful and to be valued by in the by the world was you know to be that expert in that one thing you know that people bring into a courtroom or you know like you're really the one person who can comment on something and I think that's great but I think for me personally I've found much more value in pursuing things like enjoying the work right having fun with it uh working with great people uh and also having the opportunity to change expertise sometimes and that's something I've done a lot in my career you know I've become an expert in one thing and then I move on to something else that interests me um while again having expertise in one specific thing super valuable and we need those people um it's also totally okay and important to recognize that interest shift um and you can do something else if you want to I love that and that's very much in the vein of this next question then of changing things if you want to or what could happen for any of us um what is something that excites you about the future oh I think pretty simple I'm just excited about learning more about the the place that we live in specifically the solar system right obviously there's so many discoveries and things we need to learn about Earth um and some of that might come through exploring other worlds so we have really exciting missions to places like Venus our other next door neighbor that we really know almost nothing about and I think it's pretty pretty shameful when you think about it uh so I'm really excited to see what we're going to learn from places like Venus and what they can tell us about our own history and where we're going um and then obviously just reaching further out into the solar system seeing what these other worlds are about um something about you know dragonfly to Titan Europa Clipper that's launching next year is being built right here at JPL so yeah I'm just really excited about those I love it so much yeah I'm excited for those missions I'm excited for what the future has for all of us to learn about our place together as a civilization now you're doing such remarkable work at JPL you get to play with these mini icy World Chambers you've developed and you're putting stuff inside to see what happens and testing the instrumentation will take to space with us but what is the best part of your job oh um I would say probably the people I get to work with I I think that's such an important part of of every every job right is not just the work that we're doing the specific research that we get to do and I'm very lucky in that both of those things are are so great for me and aligned very much with what I want to do and I love my job and I love what I research but I think without having a really solid team of people that you can that you trust and that you can interact with on a daily basis and defer to right tend to be experts in lots of different things none of it really works right um and so I think I'm very lucky that here at JPL I work with an incredible team of people who are all not only friendly and kind and great human beings but also do such cool science and are excited about so many different things uh and so I think that's the best part is just being excited with really cool people about really exciting things awesome I love it so much um so the last question from our faster than light round and this is my favorite of them all what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind okay and there are some obviously so many but I think one that confronts me pretty much every night at least every clear night is um the number of exoplanets out there uh so you know you look at the night sky on a clear night when you can see stars and you and you you your mind is already crumbling at the thought of how many stars are out there but the fact that we think that for at least every planet you see there's at least one exoplanet so for all the stars you're seeing there might be this just flood of exoplanets that you can't see is just not only is it cool I like I can't wrap my brain around it and every night I try to sit up at the sky and say they're out there and I just can't accept it because I can't see them so not only is it unbelievable it's also just hard to wrap your head around very cool I love it yeah there are so many remarkable things to know about our universe and our place in it and we're still just barely touching the tip of an iceberg of knowledge that's available out there I will now jump to our audience questions I see that we actually have had a bunch of them come in so thank you to all of you watching live and those who've asked questions online using the hashtag ask astrobio the first question comes from Tom Caruso who's user rendering reality 3D animations on YouTube um they want to know if you can discuss changes in seawater chemistry on Earth over time uh and how that compares to what we currently know about the the icy ocean worlds of our solar system well uh it's maybe going to be sort of an unsatisfying answer but we don't know very much so we do know that the chemistry of the ocean has changed significantly over time in different parameters you know both um its oxygenation level which is super important um so you know do we know that deep in its past there was little to no atmospheric oxygen and that of course affected the chemistry of the ocean itself uh we know that the kinds of things that were dissolved in the ocean really different as well the types of metals that were present it's temperature it's pH so pretty much everything about the ocean has changed over time the specifics of that that evolution is is still unclear the timing of it and there's a lot of work being done in astrobiology to figure that out and also how that would affect biology right obviously all of those things really really influence what's possible physiologically in terms of metabolism um so that's being worked on there's also a huge amount of uncertainty about what the oceans of these ocean worlds are like we have a tiny bit of information and that is this the the kind of the subject of some of these upcoming missions is to try to get some clarity on that but we really don't know very much we know that they are mostly liquid water um they have stuff dissolved in them they might be salty um and again all those are things that are important for biology but we are still I would say very we have a lot of work to do to figure out um what the specifics of those conditions are yeah absolutely so much more to learn yet our next question comes from Jim pass on Twitter at astrosociology and Jim is not asking a sociology question this time necessarily which is interesting so Jim wants to know if or when the search for intelligent extraterrestrial life is successful do you think it'll be through detection of Bio signatures techno signatures or some combination of both wow that's very hard to predict I would say um no I think we still there's still so much we don't understand in terms of you know first of all the the distribution of life in the universe whether it exists elsewhere um and what it will be like I think it's very hard to make sort of probabilistic um projections about where that detection will come from without knowing the specifics of what the life that is producing those signatures is going to be like however I would probably just based on you know making assumptions about the history of life on Earth um and you know the fact that its history really was dominated by microbial life simpler life that wasn't putting out for example sophisticated radio signals out into space um I'd probably focus on biosignatures again just making very strong assumptions you're making me pick something so I would pick bio signatures um just because of that just because you know the the moment in history that the kind of slice of history that we've been broadcasting radio signals for is relatively short um you know compared to this history of of Earth to begin with um so I would go with that but it's a very very arm wavy uh presumptuous answer yeah absolutely you just don't know right um I love it so I our next question actually comes from one of our production assistants um who's been a visiting scholar with me at Blue Marble space Institute of science he was a past intern with me and now he's starting his PhD work uh this fall he's coming to the U.S in September to begin his his PhD research at Northwestern University in Chicago on a root mohanti um who I'm a big fan of not just because I'm in his advisor I have been a colleague now of his I'm also excited to see where he takes his career however again he's starting his PhD so he wants to know what advice you might have for someone who's starting a PhD in research but is also interested in science communication how he might manage his time and maybe what skills you think could be essential for him to excel as a researcher and science communicator that's a great question I think just know just know it's an interest that you have um so obviously you know talking to your advisor and and not just to make sure that that's going to be okay with them because that is a big part of that right when you do a PhD it's a big time commitment and you want to make sure that that is something that your advisor and your mentors uh know about you and and are okay with I think most advisors are and they recognize the value of cycom um but also they can they can put you in front of opportunities to do that right so I was very lucky with my PhD advisor knew that I was very interested in cycom and so it would kind of pass on opportunities uh you know to go speak at schools at seminars uh and so I think that's another really great reason to communicate that openly and then I think you know really learning how to balance both things making time uh to dedicate to you know your your core skills your core responsibilities as a grad student but then also incorporating the cycom aspects to really learning how to balance the time that you have and then trying if you can to incorporate the two so one formatted video that really was successful for me was actually bringing people into my day to day right showing them what it's like to be a grad student because a lot of people don't know right unless you're a grad student unless you've been through a process that's kind of a foreign thing and people love that people love seeing not only what it's like as a grad student but also if you can take them into your lab and show them stuff that you're doing even better so I think those would be my big three things very cool yeah this balance is the most important thing I think you said there for me as well like it's gonna it can be hard to find the appropriate balance for all of us but balance is so crucial not just for research and science communication but all the things we do in our lives so I love that so much um we do have two very similar questions now one from user uh a pachell on YouTube who is doing some similar kinds of research or at least interested in similar research with viruses hydrothermal vents origins of life and they want to know about advice you might have for people who want to share that science but we also have a similar question from another one of my interns at Blue Marble space Institute of science this summer of sibsungar palette is working with me on biosignatures and doing some research in biosignatures and sip soccer kind of has the same question if you have any tips for people who are beginners and want to maybe improve themselves in Sharing science especially if doing so through social media and the internet oh yeah so I think yeah I think the recommendations I have a pretty General regardless of the specific subject that you want to go so if you're doing this through social media usually it's going to be very bite sized very very very small we're talking about 60 seconds maximum if you're doing a video and so really thinking about what you can deliver effectively in that 60 seconds so it's usually one point one main point and really you know your if your goal is to get as much reach as possible is to make it as accessible as possible way to do that do that obviously the dargan especially if it's not explained um not assuming that people know about certain things beforehand but I think one thing that's helped me is always thinking about why it matters right why we care try to make make it relatable and I think if you really go with that you start with that um you really can't go wrong so thinking not just about the technical information and making sure that's accurate and I think as scientists we tend to do that pretty well um but also like why it matters why do we care what does this mean um if you can go with that not only will it be really effective science communication it'll also keep people engaged and actually want to watch what it is you produce which really is the important thing so lead with that lead with the relatability aspect very cool yeah I love that so much uh the next question I might take first and then I'll share uh this is from user kzn on YouTube they say they are a protein biophysics researcher interested in astrobiology and wanting to know how to combine the two but not knowing where to start and what advice we might offer I think I'll start off that by doing research in in the physics and the biology of proteins you are doing astrobiology already maybe you weren't aware of it but astrobiology isn't a discipline astrobiology is a field that includes many disciplines it includes chemistry physics biology geology oceanography atmospheric chemistry philosophy cultural studies sociology all of these various Realms of learning from a human study have come together to help us understand how life might begin where life might be out there The evolutionary trajectories of life and what the future of life might be and how we search for other life there's so much that we're learning with all these studies together so I would argue that you you actually are already doing asterisk biology if you don't know it but Dr Vincent maybe you could give them some advice on ways they could take some of their research in proteins and in biology and maybe expand outward into some more very directed astrobiology work yeah well first I would agree with you I think doing when you think about it almost any kind of research in it actually feeds into astrobiology somehow and so and that's actually one of the main pieces of advice I give to people especially when they're very early on like not even in college yet uh or thinking about joining their first research lab is to not sweat too hard whether or not it calls itself an astrobiology lab because really any skill you gain in in research um will be helpful and then it becomes a matter of finding opportunities that allow you to convert those skills and start asking questions about astrobiology whether that's in a laboratory that again is self proclaimed as an astrobiology lab or has interest right in exploring these things so if you know if your current advisor has an interest in figuring out how protein biophysics in say early ancestral proteins uh might have operated pitch that to them see if you have little grant opportunities locally or you know higher at the at the national level right with these bigger funding agencies to fund some of that work or maybe find collaborators who work in that space I can tell you that those people exist absolutely people are very interested in kind of early proteins in the protein Evolution and the biophysics of that this definitely plays into it um but yeah I think in general you know thinking about next steps I don't know where this the person who asked this question is at in their career but um you know definitely you're in the right place you're doing the right kind of work um and maybe for your next Lab start to think about uh whether that's work you want to continue kind of in a new context or look for a different research lab that's doing something different that caters to another aspect of astrobiology that might be very different than proteins very cool I agree entirely um our next question from user Haley Monaco on YouTube they ask a rather fun question they ask you if you expect to find extraterrestrial comb jellies in Ocean worlds or on Ocean moons I kind of want to go a little bit further though if I can Haley if that's okay with your question I myself I'm working on an article right now about convergent evolution things like trees and crabs and some other things that have converged biologically and Metabolism for microbes and things like that in life are there any things that you specifically think Dr Vincent life might have converged to or is there something that you really want to find in extraterrestrial life out there oh man that's a loaded question I think as soon as you start to bring an evolution things get real messy um and actually that was a big part of my PhD is understanding not just the origin of evolution but what evolution even is um and so as far as convergent evolution right yes the The Hope or the expectation that you know life elsewhere might Converge on similar kinds of adaptations or at least structures so that we might be able to detect them I think um is a big part of astrobiology right we do make that assumption often we have to right because we can't really imagine something else it's really hard to look for something you can't even conceive of um but I think really the only thing I expect life to have converged on is the ability to evolve in the first place that's really when I think about it you know I think that's really the only fair assumption we can make at this point because Evolution at least even here on Earth is it's not a predictable process right it's not something we can press forward even though we think we can't we really can't um it's a retrospective thing um and so I think even predicting you know convergences is is not really possible and I think trying to do that in other environments is also really difficult and I think really the only thing we we really know for sure is that life elsewhere probably evolves right because it's part of our definition of life um and so yeah I think that's that's going to be my kind of cop out answer very cool yeah I mean there's so much we don't know a user Dale Douglas on YouTube wanted to know if there is a consensus estimate amongst us in the astrobiology community as if we're gonna when we're gonna find alien life and the true answer that is we don't know um sometimes in my talks I'll share in the past when certain people said you know within this given time frame we'll find alien life so far none of those predictions have been correct however I will say for myself it feels like if we're not alone in our little corner of the Galaxy given our detections of exoplanets and now we're monitoring their atmospheres with you know new telescopes and kind of exploring more of our own solar system it feels like we might be close I wonder if you have a feeling towards that at all Dr Vincent whether or not we'd be close to finding alien life I I feel the same way we're certainly getting closer right we're closer than we've ever been which again it's a little bit of an unsatisfying answer but I certainly think you know to your point with exoplanets but also some of the missions that we have coming up um are are starting to be really astrobiology focused and it's I think it's important to remember that many of the exploration missions that we've sent to space so far have not been astrobiology focused right they're a very small minority and so in the grand scheme of things we really haven't looked we really haven't looked very hard and that's going to change right we have actual missions coming up that are astrobiology missions and I think that's going to you know that puts us in a really good spot if life does exist say at the subsurface of Mars or on Titan I mean I think that's unlikely but who knows you know it's a stretch but um I think we're getting closer um just because we are actually putting more effort into looking and I think that's the first step and hopefully we're going to continue to do that one more um not only do I hope that's the case I kind of know that's the case right like we know that that is that's what's driving a lot of the work that we're doing as astrobiologists so I'm optimistic as well um so yeah awesome I think we're gonna have time maybe for one or two more questions um honoru mahanti dropped in another question I know that he's a huge fan of yours and so I'm not surprised he wants to know a lot of what you do he does wonder how you stay on top of the literature maybe more broadly how you stay on top of your research um and how in the past for social media how you've selected topics for instance is that from things you've been actively reading or is that from things you think your audience was interested in or both yesterday on top of literature is really hard um and especially I think for us astrobiologists we usually are tracking lots of different kinds of literature right because um we do have some astrobiology focused journals but we're usually interested in pulling pieces from from different fields from other research areas and that makes it really difficult um and so you know I it's definitely something I'm always striving to do better um but surprisingly I find social media to be a very good way to do that um Twitter in particular I feel like I've come across papers that are super relevant to my field but also just general interest to me because people have shared about them and written these little digestible threads on them um so I think that's been one kind of surprising consequence of being on science Twitter is that you get kind of put in front of these papers that you might not otherwise come across through your own searches and then also you know I'm a big fan of the Google Scholar notifications I have a lot of keywords put in there I get a lot of to me um but then also yeah just scanning around um I I kind of I'm interested in other things Beyond astrobiology and so like kind of peruse um different journals and and different cycom channels who put me onto papers that I might be interested in and also people right people just send me papers all the time whether that's colleagues or people friends of mine who think Oh I thought of you and I thought when I saw this I think it's also a really great way um to to Branch out and keep up with the literature very cool I love it yeah and the world of literature exploration is growing with AI right now too people are using AI now to help them sort through literature and find pieces that kind of fit a current realm they're exploring so I personally see that growing a lot um we have a couple minutes left I want to ask just kind of one fun quick question of you so you're into chasing storms you're into scuba diving um top of your bucket list for both what would be like the best coolest storm to chase what would be the coolest place to dive okay uh well I really have a dream of going to chase tornado alley um it's not something I'm Gonna Do by myself like I definitely will defer to experts it's very risky very dangerous but um yeah actually even just seeing a tornado is top of my bucket list and um I wouldn't try to make that happen sometime in the next few years um diving oh my gosh my list of diving destinations is uh is huge but I really want to get into ice diving eventually and top of my list would be to do that somewhere at the polls so probably Antarctica um deep below the ice whether that's the actual Southern Ocean or some one of these perennially frozen lakes Big Life pool of mine so top of bucket list I love it so for all of our viewers watching right now live or in the recorded version later keep an eye out for Elena's work uh and her research as well as on her social media at astrobio Elena and maybe we'll see some videos of her chasing a tornado and Diving under the ice in the very near future you can also learn more about her at lanavincent.com on her personal website uh Dr Vincent thank you so much for joining us for the show today like I said I wanted you on the show for so long I've been nerding out over all the cool things you've done in your remarkable research for those who want to stay in the loop who are watching right now you can sign up for the NASA astrobiology programs mailing list that way you get awesome emails about uh our show ask an astrobiologist or you can learn more about programs opportunities events research all the cool things that are going on that are supported through NASA astrobiology we loved having you on the show Dr Vincent thank you so much to her audience at home who are watching uh on YouTube or out there in the interwebs somewhere thank you so much for joining us so as always we love you all and stay curious [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music]
