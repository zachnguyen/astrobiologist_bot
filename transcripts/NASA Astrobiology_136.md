[Music] Hello I'm from Honda I'm a PhD student from University of Sao Paulo in Brazil and I'll talk about my work microbial mediated carbon mineralization from agove Brazil so uh the motivation for this works the importance of studying the evolution of life on Earth as we know that the first signs of Life are eliminations and fossils of microorganisms and within this we have the investigation of potential evidence of life such as microbial forces and stromatolites then we need to differentiate from my medic form of an inorganic mineral so therefore it's necessary to investigate the biogenicity that is that if if that was actually formed by life or not and also we have the Dolomite problem that is a major question the scientists have been studying in this region of lagova media are one of the most important records of from the past and even if with the several studies related to development formation uh the results are still controversial maybe to the the little understanding uh that exists and the difficulty of obtaining this mineral in laboratory conditions like uh below 50 degrees Celsius so given this we have the so called Dolomite problem uh which has been much debated over uh the last few years however it is possible to find a few current dollar my precipitation events in hyper saline lakes and alkaline environments such as this region of Lago of Emira and but I should do this thing that is next to each other and um so these are one of the few places in the world that has Dolomite precipitation uh today so in these places there are microorganisms responsible for mediating the Carbonite precipitation uh which can serve as a nucleation centers for for the mineral uh within their biofilm their EPS exopolymeric extracellular substance and this photo was taken during my field collection and it shows their uh a thick layer of of dolomite of dolomite sediment below and uh above we can see like a microbial match with a biofilm in the um on the top so talking briefly about right precipitation by microorganisms in nature environmental conditions modulate the communities and within that a lot of microorganisms uh they are known for their ability to precipitate minerals so these minerals can be precipitated by physical methods in which the microbial Community serves as a nucleation of a nucleation site for the deformation of carbonate or it can be in a chemical way or an inorganic as an inorganic mineral so this precipitation occurs mainly due to changes in the pH the amount of organic carbon dissolves in the medium or the environment and the availability of calcium and magnesium ions so in the case of dolomite and the availability of nucleation sites for Crystal formation that can be the exopolymeric substances present in the in the biofilms of bacteria thank you so some microorganisms have the ability to produce biofumes formed by these these extracellular polymeric substances which are mainly composed of exopolysaccharides acidic residues uh sugars they have a negative charge and and can bind to different ions such as calcium magnesium so the role of DPS in the precipitation of carbonate occurs in two fronts initially the EPS can reduce precipitation by sequestering metallic ions but during the degradation of the EPS by some sulfur reducing bacteria uh the resulting High concentration of of calcium calcium magnesium ions can favor precipitation and in addition The Continuous supply of ions added to a more alkaline environment due to micro the micro environmental generated micro environment generated by the EPS May favor the bioprecipitation of of these minerals so now moving to the Azure biological importance it's interesting to know that the environmental condition of Mars in the nwakian Hesperian period why similar to why similar to work so at that time it was a much it has it had a much denser atmosphere a higher temperatures than the possible presence of liquid water on the surface which indicates the potential of of the planet to have supported microbial life so in the face of this some geological studies of g0 crater on Mars have demonstrated a large carbonate deposits in the west region of the crater and on on Earth regions of hypersonic shallow Lakes are closely related to the biological deposition of carbonates indicating great potential for identifier identifying preserved by a signature in these regions uh so I I would just specifically uh for a through these objectives so my objectives are testing a Carbonite mineral precipitation using allophiedic bacteria from Lego Batman and uh do structural morphological and optic investigation of Carbonite minerals like x ray diffraction remain spectroscopy synchrosomite techniques um and uh they're established by viable protocols for biosignature identification so uh briefly uh you can see more in my poster for the precipitation experiment the methodology of montanale uh that is a reference that studies this uh this region was used to test if metabolically inactivated cells within biofilm could precipitate minerals only with the biofilm so the experiment was carried out in a controlled environment at 30 degrees and was divided into these conditions that we had a DPS treatment that we let the bacteria growing for 15 days then we added the antibiotics to inactivate the cells with the biofin form then we had the bacteria growing normally then we had a treatment with antibiotics being added from the beginning and we had the control without victory so we did this experiment to test if this was possible to form uh precipitates only with the biofilm but we said we said we saw that uh it's uh we we've we found a viable sales after after some time of of experiment uh within this biofilm so I think that it's really hard to inactivate cells in this way so we are trying other protocols and uh here here is only my preliminary results just giving a brief about this oh I'll talk to my poster after obtaining these precipitates we analyze the X ray diffraction to identify the mineral phases present in the sample of the bacteria idiomarina the string called uh here in the right we took a scanning electron microscopy of the the precipitates from the same bacteria and we can see the difference different morphologies such as dumbbells shapes and rounded shapes of calcium carbonates and this morphology are usually associated with biogenic minerals so we still need to analyze EDS spectrums for a conform conform more exactly which mineral each morphology relates to and finding my minor shifts in the the fraterograms and the the Raman spectrums for establishing viable protocols so this is my poster session uh 22 and that's it thank you so much [Applause]
