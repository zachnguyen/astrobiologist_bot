foreign [Music] my name is David Michael I am a science teacher here at Red Bluff High School and I'd like to welcome everyone tonight to a presentation of discovery of findings by some students that we have at Red Bluff High School we have some a class here it's uh we call it a NASA class where our students are interns who are working with NASA scientists studying much of what's going on up at Lassen Volcanic National Park and so it's a partnership I mean our high school our students and then NASA's aimed Research Center and three particular special scientists down there as well as last in Volcanic National Park and some of the park rangers that are up there uh research that our students do encompasses a wide range of things um it's kind of modeled after the study of astrobiology which may be a little bit fuzzy to you in terms of meaning right now but something you're going to learn about as the night goes on and the students have a great opportunity in this program to not only work with NASA scientists but more specifically they're able to learn from these scientists and do a lot of the skills that they learn in the classroom here at Red Bluff actually in the field up at Lassen Park under the guidance of these scientists and so because of that it's a really unique opportunity that these students really gain a lot from and so because of this we are extremely excited to have the opportunity for this program and just learn more and more from it every single year and our students just value it tremendously and so with with all this being said what we're hoping to do tonight is to share with you a little bit of what we discovered this year and so you're going to hear from the students at some point um here a little in a little bit they put together a presentation of all the hard work they did um and you're also going to hear from the scientists and and a very special Lassen park ranger as well so I'd like to introduce her first and so this is Ranger Rossi Avila Avila and she is going to um introduce you a little bit to what she does with the LA Boston Volcanic National Park and how this partnership kind of works from her end okay thank you all right hit my unmute button and uh yes I am uh graci Avila Graciela Avila in the emails um if you see that name and I am really excited to be here tonight and um I am new to my position as of a few months at last Volcanic National Park I am the education specialist here I apologize for my cat she loves to jump in as soon as I start talking on a zoom meeting um you might see her tail over here and so I was an education specialist at Grand Canyon National Park for 10 years uh left that type of position went to Yellowstone for four years and now I'm back in education at Lassen super excited I love being back at Lassen and I all I know most of what I know about microbiology is actually from Yellowstone some people call lasted volcanic a little Yellowstone and I've been really surprised at the similarities in the microbiology again not a biologist so my surface level knowledge of that and um it's just really this is an ideal position this is such a great program it's like I learn all this at Yellowstone but I didn't see the connection with education and I saw the possibilities so here we are these students are amazing I got to meet them just one time hopefully more in the next few years but um got to go to the NASA Ames Research Center and and just kind of see the end product of where their where they're um field collection goes into the Laboratories and um just the contribution is amazing I've learned just very skim knowledge of how much this kind of research can further medicine and um uh studies of space and backwards to what what kind of life started on Earth and how um so that's just been an amazing process to see and I hope that the students know that even you know this this kind of study is um it's so important for the world it connects with a lot of national parks out there but really for the whole world and even if they don't end up going into microbiology I hope some of them do but it's just such a great opportunity to learn a science Works how the world works how the world was formed and where's the rest of life so those are my thoughts without knowing a huge amount on this program um super privileged for being a part of all of it and thank you also from the superintendent of Lassen Volcanic he is the big supporter of this program he is so excited to to keep this partnership going thank you Ranger Avila um next up we're going to hear from Dr Dave damaray he is really the The Guiding light of this program he is he's kind of Taken on the leadership role of it um he is one of three NASA scientists that works really really closely with our students here at Red Bluff High School and um as a as a lead space scientist with NASA's Ames Research Center his contributions to our understanding of space as well as here Earth is remarkable and so he's going to just say a few words um a little bit of trying to connect to Mars exploration um our research up at Lassen Park and then life in general so Dr damarin thanks to Mr Michael uh and I should follow Grace's lead and talk a little bit about my background I had an undergraduate degree in chemistry and then got into geology in grad school and geochemistry and then later on got into microbiology so I've been sort of touring through the disciplines and in a way that was turned out to be nicely suited to pursue a career in astrobiology so and I just retired actually last year after 46 years with NASA uh seeing a lot of stuff over the years and of course most excitingly Mars exploration that really took off in the 90s so anyway I just thought I'd address a few of the connections between this class and uh being on astrobiology as NASA pursues it of course sort of from a historical point of view our missions to space are just a latest chapter and a long history of human exploration and uh when several famous explorers entered you know ventured into these unexplored regions their teams had experts in several disciplines cartography geology biology climate and climatology which sort of today we call atmospheric science uh and so as it searches for life beyond Earth NASA's astrobiology program must also include several disciplines to identify places that were the most favorable for life there's a lot of a lot of space out there and there's just only a few places perhaps that are most favorable for life and therefore give us our best chance of finding it to do this we must understand critical relationships between life and its environment and of course you can see how there's applications of that to many big challenges on the earth and the scientific method is really the most effective strategy for understanding these kinds of relationships and the bottom line is that the students in this class pursued a year long project that strongly resembled astrobiology exploration they follow a scientific approach they made observations in a field trip to Lassen last fall they made hypotheses to try to explain what they observed they tested these hypotheses in several lab experiments that they performed and they reported their findings in written reports and of course by an oral presentation to you all tonight so projects such as theirs are actually really improving our strategies to search for evidence of Life on Mars where is the most promising places to search but this project resembles a new and critical approach to science also namely what we call interdisciplinary research so you have the multiple disciplines but the big problems demand that these diverse disciplines require each other and work together in order to achieve progress and you can think of several examples today and the new new kind of civil engineering that is in the world today really embodies this just in terms of applications on Earth anyway this experience has taught critical thinking Stills that will be valuable regardless of their career choices and of course their generation will continue the human exploration imperative to explore the world around us and Beyond so that's pretty much a summary and I'll pass it back to Mr Michael thank you Dr Demaree and uh just and next up on our evening's agenda um we're gonna hear from the students and they have put together a a presentation that really summarizes and that's the key it summarizes their work um as Dr Dan Murray introduced to you all um a lot goes into this program from the beginning of the year till now um the students have been up to Lassen Park they have discovered and observed things up there and then they've taken their discoveries back to the classroom and in the labs we've basically tried to replicate the findings and from this from the experiments that they've done they have been able to draw some conclusions and write about it um at the end of it they've compiled a rather large report for a high school student summarizing everything that they've done um the reports that they've turned in this year range anywhere from 20 to 30 pages depending on the students and was really really thorough and encompassing um what we're trying to do tonight is to summarize that and that's hard to do in in one evening it's hard to do in in one presentation but they've come together as a group and they've worked together as a class here to put together a presentation that really does I think a pretty good job of showing exactly what they've done so they're gonna we're gonna play that for you right now um when we're done with it if you do have questions we'll be happy to take some time to to answer those questions and to share with you a little bit more as far as what they found and um without anything further I think we're ready for the presentation good evening ladies and gentlemen my name is John Sheffield I've been a part of this program for two years and tonight I'll be your Master of Ceremonies leading you through this presentation this presentation is the culmination of my classmates and my own research and experiments over the year starting the night off we will first explain what astral biology is followed with an introduction to the field sites we tested and how we tested them then the experiments we designed to test certain aspects of these field sites and what these experiments told us about the field sites to conclude the presentation we will discuss how this all relates to our questions about astrobiology and now to start us off we have Evelyn fucci a first year in this program introducing what is astrobiology astrobiology is the investigation of the origins distribution and future of life in the universe a key aspect of astrobiology is to search for and characterize the full diversity of habitable environments both on Ancient Earth and on other planets the origins of such habitable environments in the universe are attributed to the presence of life sustaining elements in the cosmos volcanic activity and its interactions with water are key aspects of ancient habitable environments we have seen evidence of on Ancient Earth evidence of such interactions has been discovered on Mars and these interactions have also probably occurred on other earth like planets distributed throughout the Universe and now Lindsay foe discussing our interest in Lassen thank you Evelyn lassens environments are an analog for astrobiology research on Ancient Mars Earth and Mars shared hydrothermal and volcanic activity in habitable environments Lassen has a remarkable variety of hydrothermal sites one of which is Bumpus hell Bumpus hell has similarities with both ancient Earth and Ancient Mars Bumpus hell contains sources of energy and water from the solutes in Hot Springs and various oxidized chemical species the Park's dynamic range of conditions are able to sustain this large diversity of microbial species a similar environment existed on Ancient Earth as it also comprised High volcanic activity and abundance of water and biodiversity across different environmental parameters on Mars there are remnants of ancient lava flows including on goose of crater faults and hydrothermal release all of which are responsible for modifying and creating much of present Warner Valley from Bedrock to Springs indicating evidence of hydrothermal activity and therefore Life on Mars I now introduce Tyler Peterson with habitability thank you Lindsay here we have a Venn diagram showing the requirements for habitility habitability is the sustainability of an environment for life in the top left we have solvents which is typically water in the bottom left we have energy typically sunlight in the top right we have raw materials such as carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur these are the building blocks of life in the bottom right we have favorable conditions such as moderate temperature and pH and relatively low salinity in order to have a habitable environment all four of these conditions must be present in different ranges of these conditions will still support life thank you Tyler after learning about the connection of Astral biology to Lassen Volcanic National Park we set out to different hydrothermal sites in which we use different meters to test these hydrothermal sites for the explanation of these meters we have Izzy carbonel introducing field and lab sites from the sites to be detailed in the following slides the teams collected two samples of solution microbial mass and gravel along with the physical samples the teams collected readings of temperature pH a measure of how acidic or alkaline assumptions is encompassing high acidity like lemons at PH2 to more alkaline substances such as bleach at pH 12 with 7 indicating neutrality and lastly conductivity a measure of dissolved solids all environmental attributes crucial to the survival of organisms the conductivity meter measured in microsiemens per centimeter standard unit of measurement for electrical conductivity with distilled water normally ranging from 5 10 to 3 micro Siemens per centimeter the instruments both measured for temperature and were team specific so readings collected weekly for each experiment were measured by a consistent meter thank you Izzy now with these meters and probes we set out to five different field sites across Warner Valley which allows us in one field trip to visit a variety of conditions in PH conductivity and temperature upon entering winter Valley first year and second year interns were broken up evenly and set out to record not only data Finance but the physical characteristic of each field site these distinctly different field sites are mainstream including mainstream below Paddle Wheel Creek and mainstream below Devil's Kitchen alkaline spring Paddle Wheel Creek and Devil's Kitchen to start your introduction to these field sites we have Bella introducing Paddlewheel Creek thanks John padawilla creek site we saw a stream that originated from a spring on the mountain not too far away from where we were in terms of life we saw that there was a variety of vegetation in and around the stream as well as possible algae within the Stream it had a pretty neutral pH of 7.6 a low conductivity of 83 micro semen and a temperature of 14 degrees Celsius or 58.4 degrees Fahrenheit basically this water has less dissolved solids in it than most well water suggesting no volcanic interaction now Sam will be telling you about mainstream mainstream is not unlike any other ordinary Mountain stream the samples we took were from the crystal clear water from said location this stream was fairly shallow with a depth ranging from around one to three feet deep differing on location the connectivity was reasonably low with it being 140 microsiemens and a fairly neutral pH of 7.2 as a detective the temperature measured around 14 degrees Celsius it is surrounded by an abundance of leafy green vegetation that grows in and around the stream with animal life being prevalent based on these numbers and observations we can infer that there is little to no evidence of volcanic activity in the Stream just as Panama wheel Creek now Mickey is going to introduce Devil's Kitchen thank you Sam and now Devil's Kitchen right away you can tell Devil's Kitchen is different from all the other sites there was no vegetation within the immediate vicinity of this site the air had a pungent smell of hydrogen sulfide which has a distinguishable rotten egg smell we sampled from a very shallow stream that eventually ran into mainstream the stream had a cloudy white color the pH was 2.0 which is extremely low the temperature was 52 degrees Celsius and the conductivity was 5760 micro Siemens which is well over all the other sites the site had many Jagged rocks and it is clear that they had been degraded over time due to the extreme acidity of the water the hot and acidic water were clear indicators that there is volcanic activity present at this site we noticed brown and green spots and filaments that could be microbes and now I'm going to hand it to Sabian Hamilton who is going to talk about the alkaline spring thank you Mickey Lassen Volcanic National Park is an amazing example of hydrothermal activity in microbial life alkaline streams vents lay on a fault line as there's a sharp difference in height there is steam rising from the water itself because it has hydrothermal features there were dead bugs and animals caught trying to cross the stream and along the side of the stream there were smooth rocks coated in a layer of white minerals plant diversity around the perimeter of the stream can grow very well however the plants exposed to the water directly die it is easily noticeable that there is an abundance of microbes submerged in the water at alkaline stream more than any other field site Sabia for field size we took our recorded data and samples back to the lab to test parameters we set up that mimics the distinctly different environments found in each Werner Valley Field site our first experiment which began in November was the introduction of rock powder to different solutions in the creation of this experiment we set up five different flasks which varied based on ph and temperature and took weekly recordings testing how these variables affect the conductivity of each solution introducing these Rock dissolution parameters will be Jordan Brandt as John has just maintaining the effects of different parameters on Rock dissolution in Warner Valley in order to do so we devised a set of hypotheses as a class which we then tested across five different parameters the first experiment involved using day site Rock powder and was conducted at PH2 and 50 degrees Celsius the remaining four experiments were conducted with basalt rock at both 25 and 50 degrees Celsius and at PH2 and pH 5. we deliberately selected these pH levels and temperatures to closely mimic the field sites with PH2 being similar to that of Devil's Kitchen and ph 5 reflecting the natural pH of rainfall we believe that these experiments have yielded valuable insights into the complex mechanisms behind Rock dissolution and we look forward to sharing our findings with you all now dive deeper into the impact that water Rock reactions have on the pH of a solution one of the hypotheses we tested during our experiments was whether aqueous Solutions interacting with rocks would lead to an increase in the pH of the solution over time we found this hypothesis to be true through weekly pH measurements and the need for additional acid to be added in fact regardless of the experimental conditions the pH of all solutions Rose every week as evidenced by the bar graph before you the bars in the graph represent the total amount of acid that was added to each experiment to keep the pH levels stable throughout the testing period this need for continual acid addition is the result of water Rock reactions in which the cations in the dissolved Rock contribute to the rise in pH of the solution had we not titrated weekly the final pH levels would have been significantly higher than the starting levels moving on I'm pleased to introduce Gage Lawrence who will be speaking on the effects that pH and temperature have on the speed of rock dissolution thank you Jordan and our Rock dissolution experiment we explored two of the main factors in how fast rocks dissolve in A3 Solutions pH and temperature these factors are chosen based on a two hypothesis one that temperature is all routes faster and the other that more acidic pH dissolve rocks faster how to show the effective pH in temperatures through net conductivity which measures the amount of ions in the solution non accounting hydrogen ions from the pH to better measure the effect of pH because it limits ph's effect on conductivity the temperatures were set at 50 degrees and 25 degrees Celsius so we can measure the difference in how fast the Rocks dissolve in different temperatures as you can see on the draft the 50 degree experiment had a much higher net conductivity at the end of the experiment compared to the 25 degree experiment by 189 micro Siemens showing that a higher temperature dissolved rocks at a higher rate than a lower temperature the second factor that we explored was the effect of pH the pH was set at two and the other at five so we can measure the effective pH on how fast rods dissolve as you can see on the draft the experiment with a pH of two the Rocks developed much faster having a net conductivity that was 2002 micro Siemens more than the experiment with the pH five at the end of the experiment showing the more acidic pH caused the rust dissolve at a higher rate not of a more basic pH ultimately our experiment shows that a more acidic to pH and a higher temperature dissolves rocks faster than a more basic pH and a lower temperature which gives us an amazing insight into the water chemistry at the field sites thank you thank you Gage after testing the effects of pH in temperature on a rock powder solution we set out to our second experiment which was the incubation of microbe cultures these cultures originated from the Warner Valley Field sites previously introduced The Experiment began assigning each intern a column containing a small culture of microbes and for the next 10 weeks track growth found within the columns during this period we were asked to create an experimental column and change one variable being either temperature pH total dissolved solids or light with this I'd like to introduce Evelyn fucci explaining the effects of temperature change on microbe incubations the first condition that we chose to study was the importance of temperature found at the field sites in order to determine if the microbes are temperature dependent temperature is one of the most important factors that can affect the growth and survival of microbes due to the fact that it influences metabolic processes and the fact that it varies site to site in this example we lower the temperature of the hair like filament since it comes from a higher temperature field site the temperature was lowered from 45 degrees Celsius to 21 degrees Celsius our hypothesis was that the hair like filament would not be able to tolerate the drop in temperature over the course of 10 weeks we observed the filament's progression giving it fresh site water to feed it every four weeks as time went on the microbe yellowed showing its decrease in growth throughout this time whereas the control kept at warmer conditions similar to where it was found thrived experiments with different microbes testing the same variable yielded similar results proving that the microbes are in fact temperature dependent and that their ideal growth occurs at temperatures near where they were found and now Ethan Lugo discussing the effects of pH now in this experiment we investigated the effects of pH on microbial growth microbes are sensitive to changes in their environment and pH is one of the key factors that can influence their growth and survival by altering the pH of the growth medium and making temperature a constant we can observe changes in microbial growth and determine how pH affects their development pictures shown are a concise representation of what happened in the microbes when changed from a ph of 7 to a pH of 5. as you can see in the pictures on the left the microbes grew normally or as they would with no effect due to the fact that this is the control of the experiment although the discrepancies between the pictures of the experiment at the beginning and end are subtle with careful observation you can see that the microbes have changed and are dying due to the yellowish color along the side with its stunted growth from the beginning this is evidence that the microorganisms struggle to grow because of the change in PH due to the findings of this experiment along with another experiment of similar caliper that is generally the same findings up next with Sam Cornelius with solute experiments thank you Ethan the next condition we chose to investigate was the addition of solutes microbes can be sensitive and solutes are an important factor in their growth in survival in this experiment 300 microliters of sodium thiosulfate was added to the water from paduate and kept at room temperature for approximately 10 weeks as the week's progressed a large green Mass formed an experimental while nothing major happened in the control the mass appeared to be two small Moss balls surrounded by a thin blanket of algae where resembling that of a spider web overall the control was alive at the end of the 10 weeks but did not show nearly the amount of growth as the experimental did from this we can conclude that the microbes can withstand the addition of this solute up next will be Joey simonis with micro lights thank you Sam the last condition we experimented with was a light the reason we chose to explore this was because we observed what seemed to be non phototrophic microbes at Devil's Kitchen because they weren't green we assumed the source of energy was something other than light in this experiment using iron eating microbes from Devil's Kitchen we tried to completely remove light except when checking the microbes adding 200 microliters of Iron II chloride at a dilution ratio of one part Iron II chloride to 100 Parts water every week to feed them over the time of the experiment we witnessed no visible growth and a loss of a faint green Hue unlike the control which grew more and more green over time and now John thank you Joey with observations taken from the Warner Valley Field sites and the last two experiments which have given us physical data on how rocks and microbes are reacting in these simulated environments we were tasked to compile this information to create our interpretation of how can an area spanning a couple of Miles have such vastly different environments and what is the geological process that affects each site to answer this question I'd like to introduce Aubry Norton covering padawillo Creek's interpretation thank you John evidence of activity appears in three forms tempter pH and sulfate levels since petal Creek has a neutral pH has a low temperature along with low sulfate levels it indicates a lack of hydrothermal activity at the site paddle Creek gets its water from snowmount and rainfall that travels through the valley the pH of this water is around five while the creek has a pH of around 7.6 this can be explained by the rocket solution experiments where we are able to prove that pH increases over time as rock is dissolved into the water through the rock dissolution experiments we were also able to determine the environments with a more neutral pH and cooler temperature do dissolve Rock but on a much lower rate this will explain the low conductivity and why the pH is not acidic due to the small amount of solids dissolved the microbes at pedal Creek mostly consists of green algae that are able to survive and grow to the benign conditions that they live in in the biology experiments polarisely discussed we were able to show that environments with neutral PHS in cooler temperatures are able to offer more steady growth to a variety of microbes now Mauricio Tamaya will explain the Devil's Kitchen site thank you Aubry the Devil's Kitchen site showed prominent evidence of Lassen's magma chamber deep underground that releases volcanic gases along a fault line and boiling mud pots compared to other field sites a small stream in Devil's Kitchen has the highest sulfate levels at 21 millimoles the lowest pH of 2 comparable to lemon juice or vinegar high temperatures reaching 50 2 degrees Celsius or 125 degrees Fahrenheit and high dissolved solids concentrations as indicated by the high conductivity of 5760 micro Siemens we replicate this environment in our Rock dissolution experiments using hot plates and sulfuric acid to lower the ph these experimental conditions increase the solution of rocks increasing the quantitative of the solutions and the dissolved solids concentrations our experiments showed that both a low ph and high temperature can greatly increase the connectivity of solutions making values similar to our measurements at Devil's Kitchen in our laboratory incubation experiments with low ph and high temperature the microbes had less growth and diversity compared to other experiments with field sites that have more moderate conditions this along with a low PH in high temperatures at Devil's Kitchen LEDs with lower abundances of microbes next up Mia Gleason will now interpret mainstream at padawa Creek thank you Mauricio mainstream Boulevard Creek has similar conditions to the padal creek site due to their closeness this stream water is a blend of the acidic Devil's Kitchen water and the fresh Paddle Wheel Creek Water since there is no hydrothermal activity near the site mainstream below Paddle Wheel Creek has a low conductivity and sulfate input but there's a small amount of runoff from Devil's Kitchen making the conductivity higher than what is found at powder wheel Creek the sized pH and conductivity is explained through the rock dissolution experiments it was found that his Rock dissolves into the water the ph and conductivity will increase at mainstream it can be assumed that the pH is neutral because the Rocks within it have had time to dissolve into the Stream the water's cool temperature also contributed to the Rocks dissolving at a slow rate our biology incubation is done in class indicated that the mainstream below Paddlewheel creek site has a high amount of microbial diversity and abundance and not a change in the temperature and pH decreases both abundance and diversity and now Mauricio Tamayo will return to discuss the alkaline stream site thank you Mia as shown from our observations akline stream is a small stream flowing by a hill with a large abundance of dark green algae at the bottom with a small steam Rising reaching temperatures of 57 degrees Celsius or 135 degrees Fahrenheit along with the second highest sulfate abundance at 1947 micromoles showing evidence of hydrothermal vents although unlike those kitchen the aqualine stream doesn't follow its high connectivity and low PH rather it has a neutral pH of 7.1 along with a high conductivity of 640 micro Siemens other solutes at Devil's Kitchen are also prevalent at alkaline stream the presence of sulfate indicates that sulfuric acid existed Underground this along with the high temperatures would have increased the solubility of substances and the solution in the site which caused the pH to increase as it had more time to interact with the rock as our lab experiment showed what the neutral pH in high temperature the green filament microbes had a consistent and healthy amount of growth in the field and in our lab incubations but our lab observations also showed that these microbes did not tolerate different conditions perhaps explaining why they were not seen in other field sites thank you Mauricio from our first days in this program we were given crumbs to a complete answer of how this all relates to Mars past with the data we've collected from Labs as well as observations and interpretations we've made down at Warner Valley we believe we can better answer this final question to wrap our findings together it's my pleasure to introduce Evelyn groom presenting significance of study recent evidence from the spirit rover revealed the presence of hydrothermal features on Ancient Mars by finding environments on Earth the chair characteristics with Ancient Mars and can Arbor life such as Warner Valley and Western Volcanic National Park we can investigate the possibility of Life on Ancient Mars and the conditions of their witch it may have lived as more evidence from Earth and Mars is presented we can apply our findings from this program to guide the search all right ladies and gentlemen to finish off the night each student has prepared a short sentence or two discussing how this program has impacted them and to start us off will be none other than myself oh okay didn't see you there deciding on when impact was tough there are countless things you can talk about that this program has provided me from Hands On learning experiences to lessons I can take off to college but you know after many hours editing this video that you guys have been watching it finally hit me handling criticism now to give you some sort of like understanding to what I'm talking about I have something to show you [Applause] now what I have in my hand here is 20 Pages representing the 14 through 20 pages long on each student's National report was this report was not something you waited till the last minute this was the cumulative of an entire year and I can tell you firsthand each student worked really hard on this this along with the experiment and the presentation itself each student put a ton of time in this and I can tell you there were criticisms made along the way now this isn't a bad thing criticism is normal but I don't think there's any other class that will get you as used to it as this class does this is a class where you have to be able to take criticism or else you won't make it at all and I really think that is something you cannot find in juniors and seniors not only in our campus but in campuses around my name is Marissa Tamara Perez and I've been part of NASA astrobiology program here at the high school for two years when I first joined I didn't know what astrology was over time with the help of other interns and as a scientist they helped me have a better understanding I joined a program because I enjoy learning about science particularly about space and there's always something new to learn about and by having the opportunity to be part of the program you open new doors for me after high school and I'd like to thank the NASA scientists who helped us throughout the year and Mr Michael as well my name is Aubry Norton and this has been my second year in this program I have loved my time in this internship because of my love for Science and My Love for learning the ability to work with and learn from NASA scientists is a phenomenal and completely unique opportunity to Red Bluff High School it has been a huge impact in preparing me for my studies After High School and becoming a more well rounded student for these Reasons I'm incredibly grateful for the effort put forth as an NASA scientist the last Volcanic National Park Rangers and Mr Michael for making this program possible second year intern this program has given me both research experience and mentorship experience which I think that I could apply towards my educational journey and which I could apply towards my professional Journey towards a um job in stem my name is Mia Gleason and I'm a second year intern from the NASA internship I learned a lot of valuable knowledge about Lassen Volcanic National Park without this internship I wouldn't have known how unique the features are within a local National Park I would like to start by thanking everyone who made this program possible it was a fantastic experience about how microbes in their environment interact I think my favorite experience was our field trip down to Ames Research facility especially the supercomputer my name is Ethan Lugo and I'm really interested in the future of space exploration and with the connections between lasso Volcanic National Park in Mars this class has allowed me to expand my knowledge on the subject thanks to all the scientists including Mr Michael I have grown my passion for space and will continue to do so thank you hey it's Mickey thank you guys for giving me the opportunity to learn and experience real field work thank you for putting in the work and putting in the hours to give us an educational yet enjoyable time there isn't a single person Among Us that hasn't been benefited from this class I think my favorite part of this year was being able to go to the Ames Research Center in City Hall the cool things over there like the wind tunnel specifically yeah yeah I had scientific interests for a while but I wasn't sure where to start with NASA I was able to explore topics that I was already familiar with as well as new ones from geology to hydrology to microbiology and Beyond I especially enjoyed the chance to try something out of my comfort zone as I had never participated in scientific research or any internships beforehand the impact that the NASA internship program had on me was all around A great experience and I had an amazing time learning how to use field equipment and having a better way to bond with friends than a normal class my favorite part of the class was the Ames Research Center field trip thank you um so I I learned a lot from this class I didn't I have hardly any experience with most of the things we did except for in chemistry so um I did learn a lot but one thing that I think is a takeaway that I wasn't expecting was learning just how connected everything is and how essential that is for life so yeah hi my name's Izzy and before entering this program I had very little experience of scientific instruments and The Limited experience with scientific procedures I enjoyed seeing the progress of not only my experiment both my fellow interns experiments as well and I am excited at the prospect of applying my new skills and future personal and professional projects I would like to thank scientist desmara scientist Kubo scientist parento and Mr Michael as well as scientist cook and scientist mayor and many others for making this program possible thank you hi my name is Samantha Cornelius I'm extremely appreciative of not all of the opportunities that the NASA program has given me and all of the people involved I appreciate the diverse range of topics we've covered this year my favorites being Aeronautics and astrobiology hey guys it's Evelyn first of all I just wanted to say thank you so much to everybody involved in these programs that allowed us to do this it was so much fun being with all of you guys and learning from all of you guys and I just wanted to say that it really helped me solidify my interest in science as a future career I just want to say thank you to everyone involved I've had an amazing time throughout the entire class and it's been a great opportunity to see our research is in stem what they really do and really an insight into what my career might look like in the future which you don't get to see anywhere else in high school so I really want to say thank you for everyone that made that possible I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to participate in this NASA program collecting samples from various field sites alongside my classmates was a truly remarkable experience I cannot thank the organizers of this program enough for this amazing opportunity thank you Jordan and once again I'd really love to thank both Dave Nikki Mike and Mr Michael for making this program possible I think that is it I have an Abrupt ending there I realize but I um I I think that's the end of it and we just kind of had to throw in those just make sure that you're all paying attention make sure that you uh realize that these are still high school students and from time to time we all tend to make mistakes um and something happened there with some of the Audio I don't really know what it was but um obviously unfortunately we couldn't hear from everybody there at the end um but with that being said um what you just saw there was what excuse me was really a summary of the hard work that was done during the course of the year and also you heard from the students just what impact this program had on them um at this point I think what I'd like to do is just kind of open it up to questions I don't know if there are any in the chat or not so um I'm just gonna allow I think Mike to kind of filter through this and if there are any questions we'll see if we can address those and go from there um I think in the meantime what we'll do is um because there are no questions we're going to recognize the students for all their hard work and so Mike um Kubo is going to present the students with some certificates and just kind of acknowledge all the hard work that they've done throughout the course of the Year Mike thanks Mr Michael I appreciate that um hey everyone my name is Mike Kubo I'm a researcher at nasaims Research Center uh with Dr nimring and Dr peronto and this is a part of the evening where we like to recognize the students by awarding them um a certificate that you know a certificate of completion that shows all that they have accomplished during during the year and so um because we're doing this on Zoom as we have for the last few years I'm going to start just by showing you an example of the certificate what it looks like and then I will read off the names of all of the um of all of the uh the students that that are completing the program so first of all um oh hello thanks okay there we go um yeah let me unblure this sorry um it's a problem the blurring of the

program that works harder than Mr Dave Michael um again 15 years of partnership Mr Michael um I know it's hard to believe I think um you know if we were to do side by side photos of you and I 50 years ago we might not recognize each other but um no I'm joking but surely it's been such a pleasure working with you and we absolutely couldn't do this without you and we really really value your partnership and support in in this program so thank you so much and last Rossi Avila thank you so much grafley for joining us this year this is Gracie's first year in the program um as our as our arranger partner with last of Volcanic National Park and it's been fantastic getting to know you and we really appreciate your support the park support and we really look forward to continuing this program with you um in future years so graci thank you so much for all of your hard work as well and again we couldn't do this we couldn't have this program without you in the Parks you know your support so thank you everyone um it's been wonderful with that I'll give it back to Mr Michael um to see if we have any questions from the audience um there have to be questions about that wonderful presentation and and there may be um before we get to questions if there are any I want to give some of these students a chance if they're here I know a couple of them are who unfortunately we couldn't hear from during during the presentation and so um I don't know if Mauricio is here is Mauricio on let me see if you are just say something or or somehow indicate okay what about Ethan I don't I have not seen Ethan I know he had an obligation tonight but I don't know if he's on or not and Izzy I think Izzy's on with us is he are you there is he unmuted um oh Here Comes Mauricio so Mauricio we're going back too and so Mauricio if you want to do your impact statement live I saw Izzy behind you there so maybe you can do yours and that is he can jump in and and do hers and then we'll let let John go as well and so if that works that would be great um so I'll let you guys go it seems like the sound is a common theme maybe they're just uh in a sound like a sound room or something you know quiet room maybe we just are unable to hear them or maybe they just don't want to talk to us okay we have another technology Source there so I think Mauricio is ready to go so Mauricio if you want to share your impact statement if you remember what you said or or vaguely remember what you said that would be great thank you I hope you guys can hear me so uh I've been uh for two years I started my and I want to give thanks to all of you uh helped us out especially they're in the in the scripts throughout the presentation I agree time especially Mr Mark if possible and I think for to all I appreciate it that's it thank you Mauricio I know we're kind of putting you on the spot there and it's probably kind of tough to get the audio to work and everything um was Izzy behind you does she want to jump in and use your your phone there or she did she run away before entering this program unlimited scientific procedures process of constructing hypotheses and testing equipment and seeing the progress of experiment above my fellow in terms well and I am excited at the prospect of a skills and future personal and professional Thank You Scientist desmara same says parent you people as well as Sanctus cook and scientist mayor this program possible great job thank you thank you Izzy um I don't think Ethan or Sam are around um and I haven't seen Tyler either so the last person that's going to go is John is John still there somewhere John's right here he has an impact statement and then he's going to talk a little bit to the NASA scientist so go ahead John all right um so I've been two years now and if one impact I can say take is um handling criticism this is a program where you're critiqued a lot on things you hear and it's honest you want the best work out of us and compared to any other thing you're getting that I know seniors who will just get angry at that and this is a class you cannot get mad you close you have to work to be better anywhere else thank you uh I was gonna do the the okay okay cool cool all right as a thank you to all the hours that Dave Mickey and Mike Graham uh for it to even function made a basket full of locally grown and businesses around Red Bluff it's just we want to thank you guys for putting in so much I don't know what we really could do with that program and we really hope you thanks so much Sean that's really kind of you we really appreciate that thanks likewise thanks a lot yes thank you and I realize without us all being there in person it kind of loses a little bit of the impact but they did um come up with some really nice local things for you guys and so we'll get that to you when we get a chance um and thank you again for all the time for the uh you know countless hours you guys put into this all the energy you bring every single time and um obviously the program would not be the same without you guys um in addition to the Nikki and Dave and Mike um there's other scientists down at AMC Research Center that helped out as well and and so um just all the all the people it takes a village and that Village has definitely been helping us out for a lot of years here and so we just couldn't be more appreciative so thank you guys very much and I just want to thank uh all you folks up in Red Bluff in return uh it's just been a nice grounding experience for us step out of our bubble here in the Bay Area and get up there and and uh share some of our science with you and and your energy and everything we're deeply appreciated it's always a rewarding experience for us thank you okay I'm I still don't see any questions so um I think we're just gonna kinda I guess that's it I guess we're done um unless I'm missing something um is there anything else that that we're gonna do that that I'm forgetting about or or is that the evening I I think that's it I I did just want to take a moment actually now that I'm thinking about it and I just want to thank um Dr David DiMare for uh 15 years of leadership in this program um as the as the principal investigator the pi of this program um we owe you a lot of thanks and gratitude for all of the hard work you've put in over the years and your vision and Leadership to make this program what it is so Dave from the bottom of my heart and I know the bottom of everybody's Hearts um thank you for 15 years it's been a wonderful time it's been a lot of fun and uh hope you do this at least a little longer 15 years the let's say 15 years more hopefully great and uh just I just want to thank you for that Mike and for everybody uh but I want to just make another key point in that is we're going to be asking the students for feedback on this year's course I know they a very nice comments that we heard tonight but you know down in the nitty gritty how can we do a better job and uh and that's been the magic over these 15 years is your feedback uh over those years and how we've used that to leverage ourselves to it better and better uh experiences so please provide that feedback which uh we'll send you the information forms for that in the next day or two and um that that'll just uh really complete the circle for our annual experience thanks so much yeah I just want to toss in John here's your chance to give us some feedback based on your impact statement and I will just take a moment I haven't really spoken yet um as Mike pointed out we wanted to give special thanks to Dave who is now retired and so he's volunteering his time for this program uh so that shows his commitment and his passion for be deeply your long history of involvement with the Mars program and your perspective that's not something that we would be able to have access to with any other person so thank you for sharing that you know the the long history and trajectory of your career with us and with the program and with the students and Mr Michael I know that this program also takes a lot of time and you have been so supportive and so patient and so giving of your time as well and we just are deeply appreciative of that and really want to recognize it and graci of course the partnership with Lawson um I think that we probably pointed out that this is the only program like it in existence um it's a unique partnership between the National Park Service and NASA and a local high school that doesn't exist for with any other National Park um so this is a very special program and we're so grateful again that you guys have been so accommodating and hosting this out in the field and we get to use Lawson as a natural laboratory which is an amazing component of the program so thank you oh and the last little thing I was telling Mike in listening to your presentation you did such a fabulous job and it sounded like I was listening to a program on PBS like it was good yeah no they uh they really nailed their scripts it was a a very um I guess very serious Endeavor they took on not just preparing the the slides the presentation part of it but then um every word was crafted with with care and so they just did a really good job with what they said and so um couldn't be happier with that so they did a great job this year so thank you guys very much okay and I think with that um I think we're done for the evening and so um we'll end it right there thank you all for for joining us um another year um every year it does get better as Mike said um we we do definitely take feedback to heart and we try to make things a little bit smoother a little bit more meaningful and impactful for the students and that will continue to happen so next year we'll hopefully be doing a doing a little bit better job than we demon did this year so that's kind of the goal so thank you all for joining us tonight and um I will see you in school tomorrow and we'll be uh back at it in the classroom [Music] bye everybody [Music] [Music]
