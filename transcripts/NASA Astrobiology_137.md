[Music] hello we're gonna jump right into things because I have a lot to say on this topic so um extremophiles can help us predict the boundaries of life here on Earth and the possibility of life on other planets yeah most extreme files that we study are typically single cellular organisms leaving a gap in knowledge about multicellular life and its habitability limits and Origins and so that's kind of where our work comes into play for my lab so we're a nematode lab um and nematodes are one of the most widespread and resilient animal phylums on earth they make about 80 of all animal life and are found on every continent and in every ecosystem including some found in like South African gold mines Antarctica and the dry valleys Etc so my work is based in the Great Salt Lake it's an analog Lake for the evaporated saline Lakes on Mars and it is also the fourth largest terminal lake in the world meaning that it gets a large inflow of water um but the only source of outflow is via evaporation it's also been geologically consistent for the last 780 Millennia and was only once previously part of like a Paleo histine freshwater lake for a really brief period of time but one thing that you might notice is that it has a really Stark salinity gradient that's caused from a railroad construction that cut the Great Salt Lake in half creating the North and South arms so the South arm is about at 15 salinity due to the inflow of water and the north arm doesn't get any inflow of water and so stays at about 27 salinity um 15 solidity adjusts so you are aware is about three times more saline than the ocean and is well beyond the previous maximum recorded salinity gradient that nematodes have been found to live in and so my lab went searching for nematodes in the Great Salt Lake and so we chose four different six different sites sorry to look at three which were from an inflow river that um was between like fresh water to hypo saline conditions and then three from inside the Great Salt Lake which were well into the hyper saline conditions and it is here that we found some nematodes so one unique structure in the Great Salt Lake are these microbialites um they're Organo sedimentary structures and they're built by file photosynthetic microbes and so our host to complex microbial communities as well as our nematodes they're also in the oldest known evidence of life on Earth some dating back to about 3.4 billion years ago um and so they can kind of offer us a glimpse of life before more complex life forms and they range about 20 to 30 percent of the Great Salt lake lake bottom so we've found that these nematodes through 18s sequencing are novel hun hysterity species one hysteria are typically a freshwater nematode though some are also found in marine ecosystems and so our goal now is to look at their genome and transcriptome in order to be able to tell the presence and absence of Gene families and see what genes are being functionally used here in the Great Salt Lake to potentially like help with saline UV and temperature tolerances and we're also looking at co evolution with other microbiota so by isolating single worms we can look at Presence of microbiota in or on the worm so we want to be able to look at diatoms fungus and bacteria and so far we've been able to do V4 region of 16sr RNA sequencing of bacteria and we found a variety of bacterial orders that are found in and on our worms but surprisingly 70 of all the bacteria found are only unique to the worm and have never been found in microbialite structures previously meaning that these microbiota are possibly living in symbiosis with these pneumatodes and offering a variety of functions such as phototrophic potential solute accumulation and arsenic tolerance that allows them to be capable of living in this extreme environment so by identifying and Reporting these communities it can help us understand mechanisms that maintain a functional ecosystem in some of the most extreme environments on Earth and could provide information about the evolution of life on Earth and also Beyond I'd like to thank my lab for all of their help and thank you today and I'll be at poster for if you have any questions [Applause] [Music]
