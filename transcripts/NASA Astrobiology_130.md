[Music] great hi everyone um yeah so my name is Rachel surprise I'm a PhD candidate at the University of California Riverside and today I'm going to be talking to you all about the sedimentological signatures of backgrounds in the pre cambrian a novel method for their detection automated detection in remote contexts and implications for the search for Life on Mars so it's well accepted that in Mars has passed there was liquid water on the surface right so this provides the potential for there to have been past microbial life and when we're thinking about looking for evidence of this past microbial life a lot of people in this room um like to think about signatures of this microbial life that are microscopic or molecular but as a paleontologist I'm more interested in macroscopic textural signatures that we can observe in the sedimentological record from standard imagery right so to find these types of signatures that could be useful for the search for Life on Mars we can turn to the Precambrian Earth which is a really useful data set for us to think about how past microbial life expresses itself in the sedimentological record because it is dominated by a record of organic matte grounds um during a time when life on Earth was very simple right um and luckily uh these organic backgrounds formed by a consortia of prokaryotes and eukaryotes mainly single cellular um have a significant impact on the sedimentological record um we heard earlier today about something called the extracellular polymeric substance that microbes excrete when they are forming a background that is just kind of this like sticky substrate and this has an impact on the sedimentological record in that it binds baffles and traps sediment that it is living on and within and thus prevents erosion and stabilizes sediment in part this contributes to in carbonate settings things that you'll probably you're probably familiar with like microbialites and stromatolites but I'm more interested in how this is expressed in solicit clastic settings which is broadly applicable to the Martian geologic environment right and one way that it can be expressed is in texture organic surfaces or iterative Organo sedimentary surface textures I'm showing you an example of that up here on the right that's actually a fossil surface um and they also impact um sedimentological packaging in a way that we can identify and cross section so when I'm talking about kind of these background bio signatures I think this brings up a really important question that I want to kind of frame my whole talk in in which is that if life ever existed on Mars was it ever abundant enough to form organic backgrounds and impact the sedimentological record on a macro macroscopic scale like we see in the Precambrian and my answer to that is I don't know um and the more I think about it the less I'm convinced that it ever did but this is still an outstanding question that we need to think about and there's one way to find out um and again this is to Leverage The pre kame Brand Rock record so as I mentioned we have billions of years of evidence of backgrounds existing in the pre cambrian a lot of which is fossil evidence of maths like what I'm showing up here on the right these are not great bio signatures for the search for Life on Mars because it to identify them you would need to excavate betting planes and it also relies on the fossilization of these surfaces that um necessitates a lot of comp like a suite of complex taphenomic or preservational processes that are not guaranteed to have existed on Mars um so instead I'm interested in looking at the impacts of backgrounds and that the extra polymeric substance extracellular polymeric substance that they secrete um on sedimentological packaging um as it manifests as discrete sedimentary structures um that cannot occur in the absence of biological mediation so one of these sedimentological signatures that I'm talking about today are called Palm says ripples so I'm showing you images of those here these are from the milpena edioca national park in South Australia which was recently opened as a national park oh my animations are weird sorry about that um but if you want to read more about it it was published um a little story about the national park in NASA astrobiology recently um but Palm says ripples are defined as stacks of sandstone bedding planes that have rippled bottoms and ripple top surfaces so we can see if we look at this betting plane here their ripples preserved on the top as well as on the bottom but what does this mean in terms of like evidence for life right um we can look at this figure here to see kind of the biological processes behind the formation of these Palm says ripples so looking at uh section B of this figure when we think about pre cambrian ecosystems microbial mats were ubiquitous within the world's oceans covering the sea floor so when these mats grew on the sea floor what they would do is stabilize the rippled surfaces so when a new depositional event occurred the ripples were not eroded um and are thus cast on the base of the new depositional event and then the two betting planes remain as discrete bed forms that are not Amalgamated together so this then continues as a process resulting in stacks of these Sandstone bedding planes with no fine brain inner beds um and is a definitive signature of past life that cannot occur in the absence of biological mediation so this is potentially a really interesting biosignature for us to keep in mind when we're thinking about the search for Life on Mars and just you can compare it to kind of modern processes um or broadleafana result conditions where we don't have backgrounds if you get the deposition of sandstone on Sandstone the ripples are going to erode and the betting planes are going to become Amalgamated resulting in a cross section something like this so you can tell that they're very distinct um cross sections one with definitive evidence of past microbial life so all in all we can see that Palm says ripples are potentially good biosignatures for us to keep in mind because they cannot be formed by abiotic processes and they can occur when and that is very thin so they can even occur under biofilm mediation so where it's not dependent on the presence of eukaryotes and they're easily identifiable as macroscopic features in standard imagery so you don't need a ton of analytical methods to identify them but this is not to say there are no limitations right firstly this is restricted to rippled Bases you have to have ripples occurring um in order for this to be identifiable and cross section but we know these are preserved on Mars so this doesn't preclude the use of this feature as a biosignature and additionally the lithological criteria is narrow you have to be I be able to identify the fact that this cross section is comprised of only sandstone and nothing no like Clays or silts um but again this is an ability we have um to ascertain on the Martian surface so with this in mind we can kind of think about well then how would we detect them right I could go through by hand and look at all of the images coming out from the Mars perseverance Rover um but that's time consuming right so there's some things we need to consider in actually using this as a biosignature um first you know there's a large number of images we would ideally like to have rapid identification of these features like as the images are taken so we can identify Target sites of interest for further analysis because Palm says ripples alone will not be enough evidence for us to be like oh there was life um you would need expertise in backgrounds and their impact on the sedimentological record and of course you want to minimize human error so with all these caveats in mind I was kind of thinking you know maybe the best way for us to approach this problem is to use an automated technique to identify polysest ripples in images of cross sections so this is exactly what I did but I am not an expert in this so I collaborated with the visualization in intelligent systems laboratory or viz lab in the College of Engineering at UCR and worked with Dr birbanu and Padma John oligata who did a lot of this work with me and the first thing I did was show them my data set from the pre cambrian sedimentological record of we had starting about 200 images of palm cess ripples because this project was born in covid and I had no access to the field um so we started with this relatively limited data set and identified caveats of the data set that the program would need to overcome including variable scale of images variable resolution of images and it would need to have the ability to account for extraneous features that are not related to pound cess ripples like plants fractures Talus dust and shadows um and all three of these problems are problems that we would also have um in like Mars or images coming from Mars besides the plants um so we started developing this program and phase one we developed the scene aware perception augmentation using composite embedding for segmentation or space egg which uses Cora and sge to identify images um pounds as ripples in images about crop so these are just kind of a schematic of those different different methodologies if you're interested in the actual computer vision aspect of it I encourage you to look at our paper genre without it at all 2021 and this first past this first pass their phase one development um was able to identify policest ripples in cross section so we can see in the pink box that is space egg and it outperforms other state of the art techniques for identifying um planar features in imagery and identifies Palms as Ripple bed Junctions with an 89 accuracy rate but 89 is not that great we thought we could do more if we had more images so once covered restrictions lifted a little bit we took 800 more images to uh kind of do phase two of this project wherein we developed SpaceX 2.0 which instead uses used a combination of Aurora and base net shown here this paper is currently in review and this um gave us a 92.32 accuracy so much improved and again we see that it outperforms other techniques as well as our original space egg so you can see it's much better at segmenting out the planar features that we are interested in and like really concentrating on the regions of Interest so to kind of conclude Palm says ripples are an important and definitive biosignature that should be included in Target structures on Mars and we have developed a technique for accurately detecting them using automated methodologies which is potentially useful for our search for Life on Mars um and just to say our next steps this project is not done our next step is to develop a classifier where we can feed through a bulk of images of different different geologic features it will be able to sort out between likely pound says Ripples and non palm test Ripple cross sections and then those likely Palm says Ripple cross sections will be fed into space egg 2.0 and that will give us a probability of um the presence of a pounce Ripples and we'll also have the ability to classify morphology and other aspects of these features so with that I would like to thank um on my funding sources as well as everyone who contributed to this product project through taking imagery of ground truth thing and I would like to thank Ross and June Fargo for access to the milpinia national park on their property and acknowledge that this land lies within the traditional lands and again there's a QR code for the life RCN thanks [Applause] happy okay fantastic Rachel do we have any questions see this hand came up first I think uh I was wondering first of all thank you for a great talk uh I was wondering does anything about those Ripples and texture or any other factors change um over the course of percambrian so like connect are there any connections like major events like oxygenation or other things and if so like can we infer anything can we infer any like make any past climate inferences for something like Mars this is a really good question and talk to me after I finish my postdoc I will anyone else so I'm wondering if there's any images from Mars that this can be applied to now or we just have to reorient the cameras to sort of start doing that there are definitely images that this can be applied to it like that's kind of why I'm like harping on this biosignature because it's a like most of our imagery we're getting is of cross sections from the Martian surface um so yeah where once we have the classifier we're going to start running them through from what I've seen just like looking at them I don't see anything um that would look like it but it's an experiment we need to run I I was just wondering uh wondering if you guys were using any kind of like uh like depth data for this because it feels like these uh sort of in the images that looked very quite 3D and you know if you have like two images yeah so we did we did um take that into consideration kind of looking at the the depth of the images and it didn't really change um kind of the performance of the program so I believe it's incorporated into it but it's not a huge aspect of it thank you yeah okay we're going to take one more over here oh Mike is itching to ask a question hi interesting talk kind of similar um have you ever thought about applying this to like maybe like um debated diagnostic like bio faces that are in the fossil record like um just as additional Earth constraints I'm not quite clear on what you're like um just similar like at least other like stromatilator microbial systems that like have debated like um sources yeah that's a really interesting question um no so this is like specifically developed just for like this one feature um I think it is work that other people are doing that are not me um but yeah there's definitely other like computer vision programs that have been developed to identify similar features thank you all right we're gonna let Mike ask a question he's been working hard for us back here this is actually my question not online um I'm just curious uh if you did see something on Mars what would you need to actually confirm that could you do it visually or would you need sample return or yeah that's a really good question I'm from my perspective I think it's like a first pass ID I think like there's it is a definitive bio signature but I wouldn't never want to just like say oh space egg 2.0 said there's like a 99 chance and that's definitive evidence I think um yeah sample return or like further analysis of um that section would be needed to like really definitively say anything [Applause] oh [Music]
