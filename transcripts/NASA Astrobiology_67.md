what is your favorite thing that life on Earth does that's a tough question but I think my my favorite thing about life on Earth is is the way it survives and functions at scale like I think it's just amazing that you can look down a microscope and and see these microscopic organisms and the way that they start existing as a community and communicating but then those microscopic organisms can change the atmospheric composition of our entire planet how you think about the scale is how you look at life you know it's you can look at a microb individually or you can look at its effect as a community on the entire planet and I think that's just amazing okay
