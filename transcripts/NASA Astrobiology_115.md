what's an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind this is a big one and it still keeps me awake at night sometimes 13.8 billion years ago the universe was really boring it was basically the same everywhere it had almost no structure to it Mata was just this unstructured stuff everywhere yet somehow 13.8 billion years later the universe has built structures out of itself of increasing complexity that have got to the point where those structures can turn around and observe the fact that they have come from this universe and even learned about that that origin 13.8 billion years ago that to me I just how does that happen how do you go from no structure no sentience no anything to universe that at least in one place has sentient sentience being sentient structures built out of that Universe capable of recognizing that very same fact blows my mind
