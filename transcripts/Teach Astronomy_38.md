[Music] in this lecture we'll define life and look at the origin of life on earth and we start by saying that we simply don't know the answer of when and how life started on the earth the reason was just discussed the fact that we have essentially no existing evidence of the very first phase of the earth's evolution the first half billion years we have slender evidence in tiny chips of rocks suggesting that there was liquid water on the surface but there are so few rocks dating back from 4 billion or earlier years of the earth's history that we simply don't know the story it's as if there was a crime scene where the murder took place a long time ago and people have been trampling over the site destroying and walking away with the evidence and burying it for billions of years there's nothing left to study so we're left with speculation and plausible hypothesis for the mechanisms of life so we know that geological processes have transformed much of the earth's original surface pinpointing the time at which life arose is therefore very difficult we do know that surface conditions would have been very harsh when life is likely to have started there is no ozone layer which protects us from high energy ultraviolet radiation because ozone is a cousin of oxygen created by oxygen and energetic reactions and there was no oxygen so there was no ozone the surface was therefore bombarded by heavy radiation from space and also by many more impacts than we see in the present day situation because there was still material left over from the formation of the planets in the solar system the surface temperatures were incredibly hot the atmosphere was devoid of oxygen and would have been toxic to life today one of the best places where life might have started was in the insulating and buffering situation of deep sea because the surface was such an inhospitable place so leading theories suggest that life may have begun where it was shielded from these violent conditions either in subterranean or underwater environments life in deep rock exists even now and is very poorly understood life in deep ocean environments like hydrothermal vents is studied quite often and we don't know how it arose but it's certain certainly possible that life could have started in an underwater situation how do we define life well biologists of course refer to the features and common features of life on earth our own biology living organisms of all kinds can be described as possessing a set of traits that are shared by other living systems and you'll recognize immediately in the definition attention between the idea of describing life so specifically that only pertains to biology on this one planet and may not be applicable as a definition elsewhere and defining it so broadly and generally that it doesn't bear much resemblance to biology as we understand it in the trade off between these two ways of thinking about life biologists tend to agree on a set of traits one is that life imposes order on an otherwise disorderly situation another is that it utilizes or harnesses energy a third obviously important one is the response to the environment and adaptation to the environment life regulates itself by controlling energy by responding and reacting to the environment and life also reproduces because for life to persist since living cells are not eternal life must continually recreate itself life is also subject to growth and development the early stage of any living organism is not the same as the final stage and on the largest scale of the environment and the organism written large evolutionary adaptation takes place this is the darwinian idea of natural selection so we think all of these are features of life and the question becomes how did they arise life on earth is also characterized by a minimum unit called a cell to identify a living organism in what might otherwise be rock in a fossil sample we have to be able to separate it from its non living surroundings and in fact in the early history of life on earth this becomes one of the limiting features or factors in understanding when living and non living material separated because cells are very small and their fossilized individual remains are often indistinguishable from crystals or grains or other minerals so looking for individual cells in a rock is extremely difficult sometimes impossible even apart from the fact that the rocks are heavily altered over time but cells we believe are fundamental to biology the cell is the smallest ordered unit of biological life and all life on earth is based on cells as that minimum unit a cell is a semi permeable membrane that encloses cytoplasm within and therefore separates the inner contents of the cell from the external environment all life as we know it consists of one or more cells how do you make a cell if you were making a cell in a lab we'll get to how the earth made it in a minute well you start with fatty materials fatty chains of acids that were present on the hedean earth they're called phospholipids and they exist in water dissolved into water when they come together they have water loving phosphorus heads and water fearing or hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails so they orient themselves in a particular way in a liquid environment of water so when phospholipids are placed in water they automatically arrange themselves to insulate the hydrophobic tails from touching the water this process will naturally form a membrane called a phospholipid bilayer and we can watch this process take place in the lab and remember this is all using ingredients that were available on the early earth how did the first cell evolve we don't actually know but we imagine there was a precursor stage when molecules which had ends that like water and ends that dislike water got together into little clumps and eventually by interacting with each other they can form bilayers and finally vesicles small spherical containers separated from the outside liquid region these are much smaller than current cells but this could have been the first starting point for cells under the proper conditions of concentration and ph fatty acid micelles may join together to form a vesicle individual micelles first join to create a large sheet like bilayer random fluctuations of the fatty acid bilayer lead to the formation of a cup like shape when in close proximity the ends of the sheet can seal together forming a spherical vesicle researchers have also found another interesting phenomena that they can replicate in the lab and that they think played out on the early earth they've shown that fine clay particles present in sedimentary rock formations will form in shells around air bubbles in water microscopic gaps in the clay particles allow water and phospholipids to pass inside the clay shell these shells then provide a scaffolding for the phospholipids to be arranged in what's called a micelle the initial stage of forming a spherical bilayer or a liposome once the clay dissolves or breaks apart what's left is a semi permeable closed membrane so by this process using clay as a nucleation site these phospholipid layers go from sheets into spheres and suddenly you have an enclosed membrane separated from the outside world that is the rudiment of an individual cell the other building blocks of life are of course the simple chemical ingredients that build into biological function when combining complex molecules very important are the nucleobases which are the building blocks of rna and dna and these were small molecules suspended in the water along with the phospholipids on the hedean earth four billion years ago evaporation freezing and other processes concentrated the nucleobases and other organic or carbon rich molecules within these semipermeable membranes so essentially you have a process by which chemicals are concentrated in these membranes and cells are indeed miniature chemical factories so concentrating chemical ingredients of living tissue and especially replicating molecules like rna and dna is a very critical first step in the formation of life this close contact of these chemicals in a higher concentration within the spherical membrane allows the more complex molecules like rna to form how did life start on earth one of the interesting speculations is that life started on clay surfaces because there needs to be a template for building complexity from simple chemical ingredients in this simulation you'll see how clay acts as a catalyst for rma polymer formation and large rna fragments can be formed in this way in the lab hypothetically this could have been the way that the first replicating molecule evolved on the early earth researchers have shown that clays such as merlinite are able to catalyze the formation of polymers of rna from single nucleotides nucleotides shown in white and blue absorb to the surface of a small clay particle shown in brown as the surface becomes more crowded nucleotides that are close together can undergo a chemical reaction resulting in the formation of a polymer or strand of rna where did life on earth start we don't know for sure but rna analysis suggests that the earliest ancestral organisms were in heat loving environments so one speculation is that they started either in geysers or near deep sea hydrothermal vents where these molecules were concentrated and then eventually dispersed into a larger environment hydrothermal vents from deep sea black smokers to land bound geysers may have been sites where prebiotically important molecules on early earth were formed this animation shows the formation of fatty acids deep in the earth below a geyser mineral surfaces can catalyze the stepwise formation of hydrocarbon chains from carbon monoxide and hydrogen here hydrogen atoms are shown as white spheres carbon is gray and oxygen in red the reaction results in the growth of hydrocarbon chains of various lengths that are eventually released from the mineral phase as fatty acids and related compounds because the fatty acids are at low concentrations in the water they are unable to form higher order structures such as micelles and membranes following the violent explosion of the geyser some water is released into the atmosphere as tiny microscopic droplets fatty acids synthesized along the mineral walls of the geyser are found in low concentration in these droplets with the longer fatty acids at the air water interface a gust of wind evaporates the water molecules in the water droplet causing the fatty acid to form lightweight airborne particulates that can be transported across the landscape perhaps eventually settling out and accumulating in localized areas up to this point everything that's been described is pure chemical evolution this evolution occurs according to the laws of chemistry and physics and since we think the ingredients are universal seen in other situations in the universe and the laws of chemistry and physics are universal nothing described so far on the early earth could not have taken place on other locations in the universe however the formation of larger molecules like rna a replicating molecule an information storing molecule essential for life probably also formed early in a process that we don't yet fully understand but still driven by the chemical laws that dictate how different elements can bond to each other at some point in this chronology there was an important divergence from pure chemical evolution where chemicals seem to just add in a linear way and gradually grow more complex where molecules emerge that could replicate themselves faster and more efficiently than simple chemistry would allow this would permit a cascading effect of increasing complexity with time accelerating the process of complexity in this biochemical soup the key ingredient in this story is rna or ribonucleic acid it's a long molecule that biologists believe was the precursor to dna in a modern cell rna exists as well as an information carrier but the vault the place where the genetic information is stored in a very robust form is dna however it's speculated in the early earth three to four billion years ago rna was the first replicating molecule and the basis of the first form of life rna is made up of a sugar phosphate backbone with nucleobases cytosine guanine adenine and uracil usually known by their abbreviations as c g a and u branching off the backbone rna is present in all biological life and is essential for controlling the intricate processes that are vital to biology most scientists do think that rna was the first organic molecule capable of driving its own self replication but there's a lot of debate this is a very active research topic it's generally agreed that there had to be many steps between the chemical evolution of non living compounds and the emergence of the first living organisms the critical significance of rna is its ability to self replicate also it auto catalyzes so it catalyzes its own reactions and so it can drive chemical reactions that result in new copies of rna being made this discovery in biology was pivotal the self catalyzing rna molecules discovered in the 1980s by thomas czech led to a nobel prize jack shastack another nobel prize winner in biochemistry has now been engaged in lab experiments where he's shown how rna molecules up to a thousand atoms long can be produced and generated within these clay surfaces of micelles or simple precursors to cells so all this work in the lab some of it theoretical some of its simulation some of it lab work has bolstered the hypothesis that the first life may have been self replicating rna molecules probably in cells that are much smaller than current day cells the large scale features of life that we're trying to match with these theories of how life started involve order regulation and reproduction so we have some of these ingredients already rna enclosed in cellular membranes could go on to form dna a more stable form of an information storing molecule dna regulates in whole or in part all seven of the defining attributes of life that we started with these simple membranes with the dna would evolve to become the first life on earth it's important to remember that none of this story has been demonstrated fully in the lab it probably happened for the first time four billion years ago and the origination of the first true biology from simple chemistry may have taken tens or even a hundred million years or more it's impossible to reproduce this in the lab all we can do is find plausible pathways for increasing complexity and that critical transition between chemical evolution and simple biological evolution we're still completely unsure as to when where and how life started on the earth it very likely happened about four billion years ago but the actual best evidence based on isotopic ratios of life on earth only dates back to 3.7 to 3.8 billion years it's speculation that it probably started before that the process is unknown but some of the steps can be outlined we know what the chemical ingredients were for life the simple molecules of 10 20 or 30 atoms that combine to form more complex molecules at some point to make biology this process has to be accelerated and we know that the attributes of life can be mimicked if we can create small chemical factories that concentrate complexity and accelerate the process of evolving from chemistry to biology and the mechanism by which the first cells could have formed in a liquid medium from fatty material is pretty well known and has been simulated in the lab so some pieces of this story have been put in place by lab experiments others by theory and a few others by simulation it's not clear if we'll ever be able to fully tell the story of how life started on the earth but progress has been made
