[Music] hi there I'm Alex Plum my talk is on auto catalytic chemical ecosystems in spatial settings uh so I wanted to start with this quote from the French naturalist George cuvier I don't think it's a good definition of life but I think it captures one feature of life that's very important uh specifically this feature of autocatalysis which I think is the central Motif for self propagation that we see kind of all across life and it may have been relevant in life's earliest stages so we say that a process is auto catalytic if the products of that process catalyze the process itself here I'm going to be talking about Auto catalytic Cycles where you have a sequence of reactions that form a cycle such that with every turn of the cycle you get a stoichiometric increase in the number of some set of chemicals that we'll call member chemicals you can take all of the chemicals involved in an auto catalytic cycle and partition them into food chemicals into member chemicals and into waste chemicals based on which sides of the reactions they show up in and so here's a simple example where you just have two reversible reactions you have two member chemicals M1 and M2 you have one food that's being used for both reactions and waste chemical and in principle these can be be irreversible here I've drawn them as reversible and because they're reversible you can drive them in either direction if you have an abundance of food they can be driven in the productive direction that provides the stoichiometric increase in the member chemicals allowing them to self propagate but if instead you have an accumulation of waste it can kind of wind down in the other direction and you can get a stoichiometric decrease in the number of member chemicals as well so we've analogized these Auto catalytic Cycles to biological species in part because they're consuming food they're producing waste and self propagating themselves and we've demonstrated that they can exhibit logistic growth if you put them in a closed reactor some amount of food available some seed member species they can start growing and they can reach equilibrium concentrations but this isn't of great interest in an origins of Life context because life isn't out of equilibrium process so in practice we typically simulate these cycles and chemostats when you have an inflow of food from a source that drives them in the productive or autocatalytic Direction and where everything is diluted out of the system and this has two implications one it helps to offload the waste to kind of keep it from being driven in the other direction and it also provides a selective pressure so that now if the cycle doesn't replicate or propagate its member species quickly enough they'll just be diluted out of the reactor so it's not trivial that these Cycles are going to persist anymore persistence becomes a problem something that they have to kind of achieve so when you simulate these you can get time series that looks like this plot over here where you have a depletion of food through time you have logistic growth in the concentrations of member chemicals here in blue and you also have a buildup of waste you can choose to simulate them using ordinary differential equations if you're in a well mixed reactor and that assumes that you have large enough quantities that you can treat continuous concentrations of chemicals the other approach is to simulate things stochastically and in kind of the large and limit this looks very similar to The Continuous case but as you go to smaller and smaller numbers of chemicals things look a lot noisier and you can start to have more contingency in the Dynamics where you can have the stochastic loss of a single chemical or the stochastic dispersal of a single chemical in a new location changing the dynamic somewhere else and so in everything I show here I'll be taking this to catch a stochastic approach so that's all the Dynamics for a single cycle we're ultimately interested in combining different cycles and seeing how they interact ecologically so here I show the the member chemical concentrations over time or counts over time for the different Auto catalytic Cycles shown on the left here they can exhibit competitive exclusion competitive coexistence when they share a common food source they can also exhibit mutualisms wherein the food or the waste of one chemical serves as food for another Auto catalytic cycle they can also exhibit predation where in the member chemicals of one cycle serve as the food for another cycle and the Dynamics resemble those that you get in the lack of Altera equations in ecology where you can get both stable and damped oscillations predator or prey dominance or coexistence of the the predator and prey and you can also get priority effects wherein two cycles might mutually inhibit one another so that it matters if one cycle gets seated in a location first versus the other since they'll suppress the growth of the other cycle so why is this relevant to the origin of life we think that these Auto catalytic Cycles provide one of the simplest ways in the absence of needing compartments or polymer genetics to get this sort of self propagation that you see in metabolism and we think that they can provide an Avenue for the accumulation of complexity to ultimately serve as precursors or scaffolds for later stages in the origin of life so as an Avenue for kind of increasing the chemical diversity that you might need to achieve later stages and we think that you can do that by taking individual Cycles composing them through various ecological interactions and then using the sorts of avenues that we see in ecology for the accumulation of complexity so how do you accumulate complexity and ecology one way is through ecological succession wherein you have some species that lay the groundwork for others to later succeed them you can imagine this in a Chemical Context where the waste or member chemicals enable the activation of new Cycles they couldn't have been activated into those first Cycles were activated you also have ideas on ecology about how to maximize biodiversity for example through the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and finally you have ideas about how spatial structure can be relevant to the accumulation of complexity in ecosystems where you have meta ecosystems and diversity among them and migration between them that allows for recombination in the formation of new ecological States so in an origins of Life context we often think about these chemical ecosystems as persisting and spatially structured environment like adsorbitive mineral surfaces uh moving across those surfaces where they're effectively concentrated where their diffusion is effectively lowered and those different ecosystems might interact when they interact they might annihilate they might continue to coexist they might fuse and modify one another and so we wanted to understand how uh these chemical ecosystems behave in space so the earlier kind of ecological time series that I showed you were all in well mixed reactors now we're going to consider these systems in space so here's an example where a cycle is seated in the center and diffuses outwards kind of spreading to new sources of food and of course we know that spatial Dynamics are important for auto catalytic chemical systems we have classic examples like the belazov's abatinsky reaction it's out of equilibrium process we know that they can form stable patterns so I want to consider cases where Cycles mutually inhibit one another because getting more complex ecosystems is easy when there are mutualisms between the Cycles it's hard when you have inhibition between them and there are various ways that Cycles can inhibit one another for example you can have the waste of one cycle interfere with the food of another cycle or you can have their member species annihilate a much simpler example that I show in the bottom this is the one that I'm going to be working with in the subsequent slides so you can put these in space here I have a hexagonal lattice with chemicals reacting within each site and diffusing between sites and I'm coloring them according to the fraction of member species that belong to one of these two mutually inhibiting Cycles red for cycle a B for are blue for cycle B and with slow diffusion they stop interacting and just form these stable patches with much higher diffusion you can see one cycle starts to crowd the other out globally and we can look at this more systematically varying the diffusion of all the chemicals involved kind of gradually increasing in the low case low diffusion case you end up with pretty randomly distributed ecological outcomes and the very high case you end up with one Global winner one cycle Drive in the other extinct and you can look at the heterogeneity of chemicals across this hexagonal lattice and what we find is that an intermediate diffusion regimes this heterogeneity is maximized and insofar as these Cycles are inhibiting one another through these reactions that might produce other chemicals that could help to provide support for the activation of future Cycles you don't have that sort of interaction in the very very low diffusion case and you also lose it in the height of each in case when one cycle is driven extinct and so this suggests that some intermediate diffusion regimes are the most favorable to uh kind of this biodiversity so to speak of these chemical ecosystems that's all with keeping these Cycles on an equal playing field where they have the same reaction kinetics and the same diffusion properties what I want to show next is when you vary the properties of these two cycles asymmetrically so I'm showing time series here on the right of both Cycles being seated in some Central site in a three by three array and they can diffuse outwards I make cycle a in Red fiercer so that it consumes food more quickly than cycle B and because of that it starts to drive cycle B extinct initially but cycle B is made faster than cycle a meaning that it can diffuse outward more quickly and access new sources of food and so despite initially being driven down it manages to dominate in these outer sites and eventually reinvade so that in the long term it ends up driving cycle a extinct and you can kind of vary these properties systematically and construct a phase diagram here I vary the relative fierceness and relative fastness of the two cycles and you find regimes in which either of the Cycles can be favored suggesting that spatial environments can select for new types of traits such as the diffusivity of these member chemicals once you put them in a spatial environment a well mixed reactor would be blind to these sorts of traits notably you can also look at other types of inhibition that don't involve explicit chemistry you can look at competition for absorption sites on Mineral surfaces and there we find very similar Dynamics and I think that this is suggestive that something like the Intermediate disturbance hypothesis might hold even for these chemical ecosystems and of course in an origins of Life context there are lots of different types of disturbances that you could have the noise of the spatially structured environment that you have different impacts and so with that I'd like to acknowledge David Baum my undergraduate advisor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and Chris campus my mentor and collaborator at the Santa Fe Institute some excellent grad students and postdocs including profile who just defended this thesis last week and some excellent undergrads that I've had the opportunity to work with including Gage actually you should be on here all right with that I'll take any questions foreign [Music] just wants to give you know their name and affiliation and ask a question that'd be great hi my name is George schaible I'm from Montana State University and I should preface I am a microbiologist so um but that was a great talk I thought you did a good job breaking down for us uh I'm just curious when diffusion happens that's I think of it in like a three dimensional space so you were showing a lot of two dimensional graphs so what does that look like in three dimensions yeah so I didn't do simulations in three dimensional space in part because I think the most like origins of Life relevant spatial structures are going to be these two dimensional environments I think the two dimensional environments can help to constrain kind of the effective diffusion that you would have they can concentrate chemistry lots of origins of Life theories that look at adsorbed Mineral surfaces already so we were kind of committed to that sort of scenario and here the idea of intermediate diffusion being favorable for chemical diversity I think that that's further support that that's the type of scenario that might be important I think there's a quote from Gunter washer who kind of pioneered some of these ideas that we don't build planes in the sky we build them on the ground and that's for a reason um I just to follow up with that what what kind of mineral surface would would you like consider this yeah so that kind of the experimental side of my group in undergrad we um we were using pyrite surfaces um but here we're chemically agnostic and we're also agnostic to the exact type of mineral surface hi I'm Ellie I'm from CU Boulder and I was wondering so I'm mainly a lab chemist and I was curious if you had any any like personal thoughts of how you would want a chemist to do some of this work or what kind of questions you would want a lab chemist to do to help ground truth some of the modeling that you do because I work a lot of like mineral absorption and mineral facilitated chemistry and of course when we do a lot of this stuff it is an equilibrium reaction because you're kind of waiting for it to resolve to equilibrium we're basing our reactions on that so like how would you kind of design something like this or like theorize or like hope for something right so a lot of what I showed that in the well mixed cases we were working with chemostats and certainly chemostats are an experimentally kind of realizable approach um there's another side to our group uh that looked for kind of real Auto catalytic cycles and known chemical reaction networks both biotic and abiotic and so I think one promising approach is to look at how these chemical ecosystems might explore that space where you seed with one chemical that activates maybe a single cycle or a small set of cycles and then through the addition of subsequent seeds you might activate kind of new cycles and so I think there are kind of experimental approaches that can be done there and I think people in our group are continuing that okay hello we have a question from online actually so this comes from user Alex he's asking can you simulate tipping points hysteresis spatially with this method tipping points uh it's hard to ask for a clarification via Zoom okay Alex if you can hear this um please clarify our question and we'll come back to you thanks hi I'm Jake from UCSD um can you clarify why you used a stochastic process to like just solving differential equations analytically yeah so you can have cases in these chemical ecosystems where there's kind of some unstable fixed point and those unstable fixed points you need some degree of stochasticity to break out of them so that's one reason if I just use deterministic simulations you could get stuck in those uh it's also the case that in ecology we're interested in lots of contingency and stochasticity and then doing lots of replicates allows you to explore all those contingent outcomes that's largely the reason okay we return for one more question hi I'm Donna from Indiana University I'm an ecologist by training and it was really interesting to see all of those theories that I've been trained for in this context um as ecologist we abandoned intermediate disturbance hypothesis because we haven't observed in nature yeah for doing years I was wondering if there are ways to test experimentally um what do you think about that and also [Music] looking for tipping points I think the online person mentioned you can probably see the signals before transitions like time or talk increasing Time auto correlation um or coefficient of variation absolutely thank you for the question yeah so I think an ecology that intermediate disturbance hypothesis is controversial and many people have abandoned it I think in this kind of modeling context it's very easy to kind of look for it just because we're doing experiments in silico and I think that if it does hold in the biological case certainly it holds in the chemical case there's a possibility that it holds in the chemical case and not the biological case um I think the weak version of this is that there are certain types of disturbance regimes that can be beneficial for chemical diversity even if the intermediate disturbance hypothesis doesn't hold her at large to the Tipping points question I think you do see sort of kind of signs in the diffusion cases I kind of vary it you end up seeing sort of power loss scaling in the patch size um sort of like you would see in an icing model in physics and so the sort of theory that looks at tippling points there would also apply here thank you very much Alex [Applause] [Music]
