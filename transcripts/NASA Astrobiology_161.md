[Music] hi everyone thank you for having me this is a very special moment for me because I am talking about going to talk about hydrothermal dance so being scrapes is a very special moment so I'm happy to share it with you and also about my PhD Journey so the link in hydrothermal veins is very important between the uh the ocean space Sciences since its Discovery in the 70s the efforts to study the deep ocean and these extreme environments has increased a lot in these last years also because of all the technology and all the improvements that it has been made through a study the deep sea and also not only it was an outstanding Discovery for your physicist geologists also for biology and microbiologists that we found these extreme ecosystems where we are finding these extremophiles that are high uh with a high diversity not only microbiology but also on microbiology and in a bigger scope herothermal veins are very important for astrobiology a bigger scope is a origin of library is a very important thing in our planet and also for looking um live elsewhere also Hamilton systems has been proposed not only a place where these structures have uh have created or originated the molecules uh for the cells but also for probably there there are similar structures uh existing in the icing wounds so this is one of the biggest scope that we are studying Hiroshima events but in particular in this topic we are exploring what is the Gulf of California and Mexico so if you're uh will hit the Gulf of California we are here in Scripps out the north if you cross the border here Tijuana and Ensenada excellent tacos if you want to stay longer you can tell me but for studying the Gulf of California uh the deep ocean has been studied for over a decade and we have well they have found uh that there is a series of transform false um and spreading centers which have led to the discovery of hydrothermal vent systems in particular we have found here it is uh impascular Basin at South of the peninsula of the Gulf of California we have found two hydrothermaline systems I'm sorry they they moved but here the yellow dot it's called Alka and the Red Dot is called Alka was discovered in 2015 and jagma has were discovering 2018 these are the hierothermal band fields that are at a depth of 3650 meters that this is the deepest known halothermal vein system in the Pacific Ocean where it has led us to study them as a very extreme ecosystem and we have found that the the chemistry of these harassment veins are it's very unique they are made of calcite and they have been some temperature measurements of between the 20 degrees to 100 degrees Celsius in around the 30 minutes while one of the the highest hydrothermal veins temperature goes around 300 degrees so uh one of the questions that we have one of the big questions that we have for studying this hydrothermal vein systems is who are the microbes related to the hydrothermal fluids in the sediments of the Alka and jagma Halo thermal band feels because we don't know a lot of these heart Hamilton systems so the first question was who are them um so for this oceanographic expedition was made in 2018 about the research vessel Falcor and these research vessel has a ROV called Sebastian which is a Rover that left us submerged and with our robotic arm it had it was able to take some samples of the sediments so here you can see a little insight about how are the sediments around these hierothermal vents all the things all the white stuff that you see around is microbial mat so we collected around very approach course sediments and all these curl samples were section um on the ship and it will stop something with um for taking DNA extraction to do poor Water Analysis but in the lab we made some iron chromatography DNA amplification of 16s some sequencing and bioinformatics and of course some statistical analysis and so here I'm going to present you some of the of the results of of this so one of the questions we also have in the first place is how are Alka and Jack Maja are compared how are these aerothermal vein systems related because uh our contigma are like two kilometers away so we wanted to compare how much are they similar in terms of the geochemistry and all the microbiology that we have been found in so we perform this MDS analysis so if you see that we have three different locations Alka and jagmada are the Hamilton films but we also have a Dollar location that is called your vacuum I'm sorry for the names all the names are native words from the region so that's how we decided Well scientists have decided to to name them uh these both are hydrothermal vent systems but all the vacuum is a site between them but it's a death site so it's not active anymore so we use it as an outsider to do this uh test so in general terms you can see that they are very similar okay and here is this is the outsider your vacuum that it looks um not that similar to them so they are sharing uh a lot of of things but where exactly we don't say we don't know what if it's radio chemistry of this the microbiology so um we want to go further in to study the microbial composition of both of them and compare them and to see if they are related or what are the difference between them and one of the um a biggest surprises that we have is that the microbes are related to the hydrothermal fluids but between Alka and jagma the haritha well the microbes are different they have we have different a film composition uh but the only uh film they share is Thermo thermosogata so this is a very um interesting thing to to explore that we are finding different microbial communities between those those hydrothermal veins but we are they are sharing one so this is telling us about the thermophilic and hydrothermal fluids all the ambiento all the the conditions the extreme conditions that are around and also they tell us about all the um your Chemistry that is happening is telling us about all it's very complex I think that all the metabolism that is going on between these sediments around Harold Hamilton events so we are trying to explore furthermore about this uh group The thermosogoda that they are extremophiles they are adopted more than 50 degrees or 80 degrees Celsius so we are trying to to understand if these are like the same families that they are sharing or not that's one of the next steps for this but also the implications for astrobiology in term for a hypothermal veins is that we are uh ex still exploring a lot of findings of thermophilic microbial communities in this hydrothermal vein systems so try to understand the limits of Life on our Earth as it is one of the deepest points of the Pacific Ocean it is telling us a lot of information about that and also all another step for the investigation that is going on it's applying it to the icy moons with habitable habitability models where we can try to have these ecological models and now we have data to try to simulate this we have your Chemistry data we have microbiology data so we can try to approach ecological model to the isomers if someone in the isemons one so collaborate please let me know um uh well the highlights of this presentations to take away I want you to well to uh to show you some of the hydrothermal veins how the hydrothermal vent system looks like in pascara Basin but this is the first uh insight into Jack Maja ahara thermal vent feel and its microbiology the first time that we have seen this our findings provide valuable insight into the deep sea biosphere and that we are learning that we there are a lot of information that still need to be processed and to know and to discover and we have uh found a diverse range of extremophiles in microbial communities right now I'm just talking about the thermophiles but we have methane oxidizers anaerobic micro microbial organisms so there are a lot of things going not in the in the tab and well knowing that the Pescadero Basin is the deepest hydrothermal ecosystem in the Pacific Ocean well it implies that we are still understanding the limits of life on Earth ambitions so with this I want to thank you please uh if you want to know a little more about the Mexican astrology Society there is a link and I am also from the astrobiology lab at unan and we are happy to collaborate thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you for your talk um I was just curious do you find many Nano prokaryotes like Nano archaea or like candidate Philo radiation bacteria and or do just filter them out in your analyzes somehow or like are there any interesting patterns well Ryan well we're finding uh also Archaea and bacteria well that's like the further that we have like now there is a lot still no information to to show up but there is there's a lot of things going on yeah I just remember like looking through various papers is there a lot of them a lot of those like Nano sized plays present in the hydrazone events like Nano arcura or yeah like nanarkio or yeah is also in there yes yes sorry uh just kind of curious I I'm um so I'm a physics kind of background person of mrsd and I was wondering about temperature management so like you know above above certain temperatures like you're gonna get denatured proteins and stuff like that and I was wondering if there's extremophiles that do like that cool themselves somehow or any anything like that sorry yes uh actually well right now um here I'm talking uh again as uh with thermophiles but actually here in the hierothermal bands well not the harothermal bands around thermal veins all these sediments there are different changes in temperature so right now I am talking about the highest ones that we have a measure but if you go further the hydrothermal bands it drops to 2 degrees Centigrades so we are studying well this is able to study different microbial communities adapted to high temperatures but also to call call these places around any other questions for a minute hey really awesome talk this is really cool I worked with um hydrophone vents as an undergrad so this is like really nostalgic for me um I'm curious if anyone in your group or anyone part of the the cruise is doing it and Karen Lloyd wouldn't wouldn't like this but is doing any culturing um from these environments yes like specifically I'm thinking it high pressure because these are some of the like deeper events in the Pacific or the deepest vents in the Pacific I think you said and so I'm just curious if anyone's doing culturing and if they're including pressure in that yes uh actually one of the uh here in one of the collaborations that we have is in Caltech in Victoria orphan's lab yes uh the group are making some cultural experiments with some of the uh different uh sediment cores in different sites so they are trying to to do that and they have also published one paper about culture in archaea I think so they are they are doing it but of course the challenging things about depression so they have like this tank to try to approach that yes they are trying to do cultural techniques for this any questions from up top any questions here I thank you for the talk um I have a very trivial question uh we've been having issues with sediment samples in our lab um freaking out how not to contaminate them or not being sure if they are contaminated then we are taking the samples I wonder how you control control for that yeah that's a good question so when we are working on uh on the ship uh back in the lab there is a lot of possibilities that it got contaminated we will try to be as quick as possible and in clean spaces but we actually where we are working with sediment course it's muff so it gets really moved all around we try to clean but we just try to be as quick as possible one of the things that we rely on is a bioinformatic analysis so in the bioinformatic analysis when we are um processing all the 16s data the sequences we are filtering them so we have like uh we process we have also for the 16s sorry or the DNA extractions on blanks and some control samples so we tried like if there is a sequence uh in the blank on the control we delete them so we try to filter and to make the the cleanest sequence possible as possible but yeah of course there is uh some contamination and we also like sometimes we see like oh that's that's not from the deep sea but we try to see the the sequences and try to clean them that's why any last questions okay thank you very much thank you [Music]
