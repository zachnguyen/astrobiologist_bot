[Music] in this module on habitability the first lecture is cosmic chemistry we've seen how the sites for life planets are widespread in the universe astronomers have had enormous success in finding exoplanets including hundreds that are earth like now we move to the ingredients of life the prerequisites we think are needed for biology to operate starting with cosmic chemistry carl sagan once said if you want to make a apple pie from scratch first create a universe what he meant was that the chemical ingredients for apple pies and other mundane things but also more profound things like human beings start from cosmology they start from the ingredients that the universe has provided that go into these living organisms let's look at three very different parts of the universe and consider the frequency of abundance of their most common atoms let's start with the sun these are the percentages of atoms in a typical sample of the sun and we can see that the sun is almost entirely made of hydrogen and helium and the sun is currently converting its hydrogen into and the three biogenic elements or life important elements of carbon nitrogen and oxygen are highlighted in red are far rarer than the abundant ingredients of the sun so we see less than a tenth of a percent of oxygen by number of atoms only a third of a tenth of a percent of carbon and even less of nitrogen strikingly small numbers of the atoms that are believed to be essential for life as a counterpoint look at the ingredients of a human being or really any biological specimen we see a large amount of hydrogen second most common ingredient is oxygen and the two to one ratio reflects the fact that humans and most mammals are about two thirds water other creatures may be larger or lesser components of water but this two to one ratio of hydrogen and oxygen is going to be typical the third most common ingredient is carbon we are carbon based life forms carbon provides the many bonds that are required to make extremely long molecules and generate biological complexity but you can see that the carbon oxygen and nitrogen that are essential for life are far more abundant by at least an order of magnitude in humans or in biological tissue than they are in the sun let's look at the planet we're standing on the earth's crust is composed primarily of oxygen and silicon with the next most abundant ingredients the two metals aluminum and iron and that's because the rocks we stand on are mostly silicates or carbonates involving a fairly large amount of oxygen silicon calcium carbon and sodium again very different composition of course from the sun which is a gas ball made of hydrogen and helium or human beings that are primarily made of water the basic point here is that carbon nitrogen and oxygen are enriched in living organisms relative to a typical sample of the universe which is a star by a factor of hundreds and we have to know where this came from and why did this happen let's start with the lightest elements the ones that the sun is made of hydrogen helium and a small amount of deuterium and lithium deuterium is a heavy hydrogen isotope were from the big bang itself produced by fusion in the first few minutes when the universe itself and as a whole was as hot as the center of the sun is now which is to say 10 million kelvin or larger this process cosmic nuclear synthesis was a profound process that in literally a couple of minutes created one quarter of the universe by mass into the form of helium from the primordial ingredient of the universe hydrogen which is the simplest atom one proton and an orbiting electron if no stars had formed in the expanding universe and they of course were caused by the collapse of gravity in pockets of the universe as it got cooler and older then we would not be having this discussion there would be no astrobiology course no humans nothing to talk about because life would not exist a universe consisting of only hydrogen and helium is unable to make any molecule hydrogen can form its own molecule h2 and helium is inert and does not bond with any other element so universe composed of only hydrogen and helium is a boring universe as far as biology is concerned in other words although these raw materials were available early in the universe they alone are not sufficient to make biology for biology we need stars stars are nuclear reactors which by the fusion process are building heavier elements from lighter elements the most familiar version of this process is what happens in the sun where four hydrogen nuclei or protons are combined to make a helium nucleus which consists of two protons and two neutrons that is the process of fusion that the sun has been doing for 5 billion years and will do for another roughly 5 billion years all the heavy elements however beyond helium were made in the cores of stars either stars more advanced in their evolution than the sun or particularly stars more massive than the sun to make heavier elements requires a temperature in the gas or plasma that can overcome the electrical repulsion between nuclei two protons will resist being close to each other by their electrical force two hydrogen nuclei have two protons and so the electrical force is four times larger of repulsion requiring correspondingly larger temperature to force them to fuse and so on up the periodic table so the principle is that inside stars higher and higher temperatures are required to fuse heavier and heavier elements because a temperature and pressure is required to force those nuclei to merge the fusion of two nuclear helium nuclei doesn't work because we're talking now about how does carbon form if carbon is the ingredient for life then carbon is an interesting part of this process because helium fusion must combine three helium nuclei to make carbon this turns out to be an interesting process it requires the coincidence of a triple fusion to generate a carbon nucleus and that's because the product of the helium fusion of two nuclei has a very short radioactive decay time and so essentially disintegrates before the third nucleus can be added this alone plus a nuclear resonance that was discovered in the 1950s and 60s that facilitates that fusion means that carbon is far less abundant than helium in the universe by a factor of hundreds so carbon is actually a rare element cosmically speaking but sufficient carbon is made inside stars obviously to create biology on this planet to allow rocky material to exist and we think for life to potentially be abundant throughout the universe now there are other ingredients for life that involve heavier elements than carbon nitrogen oxygen and other trace elements that the human body and other biological tissues depend on where do these elements come from the same process except in this case stars like the sun are insufficient we need more massive stars which go on to make heavy elements by simple combination think of the nuclei as little lego blocks combining to make heavier nuclei in situations of enormous temperature and pressure the most massive stars can go up the periodic table to make heavier elements than carbon all the way up to iron naturally the process stops at this point because iron iron is the most stable atomic nucleus and requires an energy input to go beyond this nucleus and that energy input only happens in a dying star or a supernova another thing that's going on here is that helium capture reactions that is building atomic nuclei by the addition of a helium nucleus rather than a single proton add protons two at a time and since protons are being added one at a time and two at a time elements with even atomic numbers in the periodic table are slightly more abundant than without atomic numbers when we look at the abundance of elements in the periodic table cosmically it has a sawtooth pattern representing this fact so massive stars are required to generate the heaviest elements in the universe by the time a massive star has evolved it has this structure shown in cartoon form obviously the materials are mixed and the demarcations are not as sharp as in a cartoon basically it's an onion skin model where the more central regions have higher temperatures and so are able to create heavier elements by fusion and you see that the outer part of a massive star may still consist of some hydrogen that has not even been fused into helium within that there will be a region where hydrogen fusion is taking place and helium is produced within that a region where helium fusion is occurring and by that triple combination process carbon is being created within that carbon can fuse with other smaller components producing oxygen and so on and you see at the center of this onion skin there's actually iron and the core of a very massive star late in its life consists of iron now this is not any iron that we'd be familiar with this is not solid iron or even liquid iron this is iron in the state of a plasma at a temperature of hundreds of millions of kelvin and a pressure and a density that's far beyond the density of normal iron a truly bizarre state of matter so there's shell burning occurring that creates all these elements and they're trapped in the star at this point so if all the stars did was to make these heavier elements and keep them inside their cores once again there would be no life in the universe something else has to happen that something else is cycling of materials stellar cycling this life cycle of massive stars is represented schematically in this diagram where we can see that the material between stars a very low density gas of also including some dust particles collapses to form stars and as we know planets those stars go onto the main sequence which is where they turn their hydrogen into helium and if they're massive enough they go on to create other heavy elements late in their lives stars become unstable and massive stars can eject envelopes consisting of 20 percent 30 even a half of their mass out into interstellar space because the stars have convection which is to say big convective cells of plasma circulating inside and outside through their core the heavy elements they already contained or had created are mixed and so the outer envelopes are not in a simple onion skin but actually contain some of the heavy elements when they move out into space so in that one way heavy elements get seeded into space for a massive star there's a second even more dramatic version of this when the core of the star collapses because no fusion is possible there's no new energy source and gravity must win the rebound from that collapse causes a dying star supernova a fantastic brightening of the star for a very short period of time the expulsion of a gaseous envelope at large fraction of the velocity of light and the spontaneous creation of heavy elements by a process called explosive nucleosynthesis these heavy elements are then injected directly and quite far into the interstellar medium so this cycling process is gradually seeding the space between stars out of which a next generation of stars will form with heavy elements including those necessary for life the interstellar medium is being enriched in this process and so the relative abundance of carbon nitrogen and oxygen to take those important biogenic elements is steadily increasing over cosmic time soon after the big bang before stars and galaxies had formed there was literally just the hydrogen the helium a little bit of lithium a little bit of deuterium but over time as stars and galaxies form as they cycle our elements and in the 13 billion years of the universe since then the amount of heavy elements including carbon nitrogen and oxygen has been steadily and smoothly increasing in the galaxies with active star formation spiral galaxies this process is more vigorous and the fraction of heavy elements in those galaxies is larger than in a galaxy with mostly old stars like elliptical galaxies so we can look at the common elements for life now in the context of this story of stellar nuclear synthesis and we can see that while the sun consists mostly of primordial material the hydrogen and helium that the universe was born with or created in the first few minutes it still includes a small amount of heavy elements those heavy elements pre existed the sun's formation so since the sun is not making carbon or oxygen or nitrogen the relatively small amount that it contains was produced by previous generations of stars and was swept up into the material that collapsed to form the sun similarly the heavy elements that we are made of were obviously pre existing and so those elements including those carbon nitrogen and oxygen atoms in all of our bodies are at least four and a half billion years old because they were created in generations of stars before the earth and the solar system and the sun formed in fact we cannot say how old those atoms are some of them could have been generated by fusion in a distant star billions of years before the earth formed we can take another couple of examples in the solar system and see that the composition of the atmospheres of the giant planets contains hydrogen and helium as we've seen before similar to sun material and then molecules which have carbon and nitrogen in them once again those heavy elements were pre existing the formation of the solar system in a situation like mars we have carbon dioxide so once again carbon is involved a life producing substance but not involved in life in this particular situation and the second most abundant ingredient in the mars atmosphere is actually the inert ingredient argon which was once again produced by stars so we have a picture where a massive star initially in the early universe is actually made of primordial hydrogen and helium and so there must have been a time at which the first heavy elements in the universe were produced astronomers or cosmologists call this first light this is the time when the first stars and galaxies formed and the first heavy elements were produced we don't exactly know when first light was but it was probably about a hundred billion million years after the big bang so really in the first few percent of the age of the universe and elements have been produced steadily since then so this process this process of star formation the creation of heavy elements in massive stars is a universal process we see it playing out in distant galaxies we know it's played out over cosmic time and therefore the production of the biogenic or life essential elements is also a universal process similarly we've seen that the process by which stars form and surrounding planets form that we also believe to be a universal process playing out in distant galaxies throughout the universe and throughout cosmic time so two of these very major pieces of the story of biology on our planet are parts of a much larger story a cosmic story of life and the formation of the sites for life and the ingredients for life to summarize this lecture we've seen that there are ingredients for life that are essential they're considered to be carbon nitrogen and oxygen however the universe did not originally contain these ingredients the universe was made of hydrogen and then within a first few minutes after the big bang helium was created in the mirror of the process occurring in the sun right now only in a situation where the entire universe was hot and dense and able to make fusion turn hydrogen into helium all the heavy elements beyond those and a smattering of other light elements were created inside stars and most of the heavy elements were created in the cores of stars much more massive than the sun able to create high enough temperatures through the fusion process to generate elements up to iron to go beyond iron extra energy is needed and that typically comes from a supernova the collapse of a massive star and then an explosive blast wave that creates heavy elements all the way through the periodic table as stars age they eject envelopes of gas into space and when they die explosively they eject even more material and in this way the heavy elements are seeded through space where they can become part of the next generation of stars so the existence of life in the universe given its dependence on heavy elements has been a process that's played out for over 13 billion years as the fraction of heavy elements in the universe from a still very low level has steadily increased over cosmic time
