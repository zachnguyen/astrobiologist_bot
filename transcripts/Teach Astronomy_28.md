[Music] in this lecture we'll consider two other methods for detecting exoplanets direct imaging and microlensing and we'll also look at the overall selection effects that influence our understanding of exoplanets an obvious question is why don't we just make an image of these exoplanets seeing is believing it turns out that the most obvious thing to do with an exoplanet is the hardest thing to do and it's because the exoplanet does not emit its own light it shines purely by the reflected light of the parent star and the parent star is far brighter than the exoplanet exoplanets even the most massive and largest are hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent star earth like exoplanets are more like a billion times fainter than their parent star and they're very close to the star as seen from large distances imagine trying to see a firefly next to a stadium floodlight this was an obstacle for many years in making an image of an exoplanet here's a simulation of the detection of an exoplanet by imaging first the central star must be blocked out reducing its light intensity by a factor of hundreds of millions to allow the faint reflected light from the exoplanet to be visible but that's essentially what's required to make this technique work which means we just need to understand the optics of the telescope making the image very well and we need to occult the central star extremely accurately to see such a tiny amount of residual light now this method of direct imaging by occulting the central star is much easier or more efficient at long wavelengths than short white lengths which is to say the near infrared as opposed to the visible and that's because the brightness of a star declines towards the infrared as you move to those invisible long wavelengths because the stars are hot whereas the brightness of an exoplanet increases towards the infrared because a planet is warm and not as hot as a star so its radiation curve is still increasing at longer wavelengths and that means the contrast of an exoplanet by direct imaging can be 10 or 20 times better in the near infrared than it is at visible wavelengths planets have been imaged both in optical wavelengths and infrared wavelengths but it didn't happen until about a decade ago because the method requires such exquisite optical precision and suppression of the central starlight here's an example a couple of examples the one on the left is done with the european southern observatory and that's an optical image where the central star has been blanked out and the exoplanet is directly visible and the one on the right is done at infrared wavelengths showing also clearly the exoplanet this of course will work most easily as with all the other methods for more massive planets closer to their star because closer to their star they reflect more light and more massive they're larger and so reflect more light here's another example this time from the keck observatory in hawaii 10 meter telescopes working in the infrared of the star hr8799 which shows three orbiting exoplanets suppressing the starlight from the central star the planets are visible in the infrared it's imperfectly subtracted and the residual effects you see from the imperfect model point spread function of a star so there's a lot of noise but the planets are clearly detected this technique of course can be used over time to map out the orbits of the exoplanet so imaging exoplanets not only can detect them but give their orbital properties in periods it also directly shows the orbital period and of course the distance from the parent star in this case the planets are young and hot and so they actually grow more brightly in the infrared than by reflected optical starlight a key tool in this kind of work is called a coronagraph a chronograph is an instrument specifically designed to block out the central circle of its field of view now that's opposite to what astronomers usually do usually astronomers want the center of their field of view visible that's where the object they point the telescope is at but in this case we're using averted vision if you like we're trying to look slightly to the side of the object that we're pointing the telescope at and we essentially want to use this corona graph method to blot out the central starlight it's an extremely difficult technique that requires modeling of optics and exquisite optics to start with to get good subtraction and you can see on the right how well it can work because you're essentially subtracting all the starlight down to a residual level of about one part and ten to the eighth that's a millionth of a percent that's all that's left when you see the reflected starlight from the planets so it's very challenging it's at the limit of capability it's actually better done in general in space than on the ground because the stability of the conditions with no atmosphere is better but all major ground based telescopes can use coronagraphic methods to study exoplanets the number of exoplanets directly imaged has grown steadily to over 100 another method that's used to detect exoplanets in very small numbers but it's an important addition to the complement of methods it's called gravitational lensing this is another indirect method that uses lensing which is a signature of general relativity predicted about 100 years ago in gravitational lensing a massive object is warping space time around it and light from a background source that passes through this warped space will have its trajectory changed by the warp spacetime also the warp spacetime alters the trajectory of light or radiation traveling through it it can bend this light it can even focus this light and magnify or amplify it and this is why it's called lensing it's directly analogous to optical lensing with lenses and mirrors so when two stars align in front of one another the gravity of the foreground star can warp the light from the background star making it appear brighter during the alignment if the foreground star has a planet that magnification will increase even more and so we see what's happening here as a invisible foreground star passes in front of the background star the light increases in a lensing event and if that star is also accompanied by a planet the planet adds a component of lensing the length of the lensing event reflects the mass of the object so the star causes a slower lensing event than the planet which is quite quick so this little extra blip on the lensing curve caused by the star often only lasts a few hours so very detailed exquisite observations are required to see this here's a simulation of the gravitational microlensing method for detecting an exoplanet in microlensing a star passes in front of a more distant star and the light rays are bent causing a momentary amplification of the star's light if that star in between has an exoplanet orbiting it it causes a secondary spike in the microlensing curve now of course this is an unlikely event and it turns out you have to observe hundreds of thousands of stars to have a chance of seeing one of them accidentally or incidentally microlensed by a passage of a four grand stars the reason it's so rare is of course because space is mostly empty so the odds that a foreground star will pass directly in front of a background star are very low meaning you have to observe many of them to see this happen at all and in fact in the spectrum of observations of exoplanets microlensings contributed very few events just over a dozen heading perhaps towards 20 in the next few years most of the candidates we see in terms of distance from the star and planet mass are from the kepler satellite at sea of green dots the radial velocity method has contributed most of the larger planets including some at the larger distances but microlensing is an important complement to the other techniques for a couple of reasons first microlensing is extensive to extremely small mass planets because the microlensing effect is quite strong even for a small mass in principle microlensing can detect not only earth mass but mars mass perhaps even moon mass objects and so in principle it is the most sensitive planet hunting technique of all that's powerful another reason it's powerful is is not subject to the same selection effects as the other methods those other methods as we've seen are far more effective at finding larger or more massive planets than low mass planets microlensing is almost equally sensitive to all masses of planets if you have sufficiently good observations also the other planets the other techniques tend to be better with closer planets and brighter nearby stars microlensing is good for finding exoplanets at distances of thousands or even tens of thousands of light years so that's another important reason why we need it in the tool kit to cross check the other methods here we bring all the methods together simple a telescope cannot detect exoplanets pulsars detected a couple in 1992 many of the first discoveries used the radial velocity technique then transits took over the small eclipse effect with the kepler satellite astrometry has been used to find several and microlensing is an important technique for low mass planets finally imaging has been successful in a few dozen cases let's finish this by talking about the selection effects that apply to detecting exoplanets obviously what we're aiming for is a true knowledge of the underlying population of exoplanets all of them all their masses all their sizes all their orbits all their situations all their multiplicities how many times are multiple planets in the system that's the ideal but of course we're far from that ideal because we're limited by data just to illustrate the selection effects of the main methods let's compare two situations we'll take a solar system analog and we'll talk about the sun jupiter and the earth and so we're asking about the difficulty or ease of detecting a jupiter around a sun or an earth around the sun starting with the doppler method compared to the earth jupiter is five times further away and a thousand times more massive so the earth being closer and less massive in the lever arm argument or the center of mass balance beam argument is a 200 times worse lever arm in other words it's much harder with the doppler method to detect earth's than it is to detect jupiters the speed of the doppler shift caused on the sun by the motion of the earth is nine centimeters per second that's a that's a very small walking pace that's extremely difficult to detect and as we've seen it may be almost beyond the limit of the doppler method what about the eclipse technique well compared to jupiter the earth is 10 times smaller so 100 times less surface area so that one percent dimming of a jupiter crossing the face of the sun goes down to a 100th of a percent dip for the earth and that's tough but doable and clearly the kepler mission succeeded magnificently in finding hundreds of earth like planets because it was designed to detect that size of an eclipse what about direct imaging which has been successful in a small number of cases well the earth is a hundred times less area but it's five times closer so the amount of reflected light from the earth goes up by 5 squared which is factor of 25 so it's actually only four times less reflected light than a jupiter if that were the only thing it would seem like direct imaging is not that much harder for an earth than it is for jupiter except for the distance the earth is five times closer to the star than jupiter and that means when you're making a direct imaging observation on the sky you're blotting out the star and looking five times closer into the noisy wings of the subtracted central starlight than you would be for a jupiter and that's why direct imaging has not yet succeeded in seeing earth like or even super earth like planets other selection effects of course are associated with the methods themselves and their limitations the doppler method measures the radial component of what's a three dimensional space motion so instead of measuring mass exactly it measures the product of mass and the sign of the inclination angle and the inclination angle is unknown and so for an individual mass it's an underestimate by a fact by a factor which is undetermined unless we have a statistical sample for the eclipse method the orientation has to be edge on or just right otherwise the planet will not appear to cross the face of the star as seen from our perspective so only a small fraction of the exoplanets eclipse their stars since they're randomly oriented in space there's also a selection in favor of hot jupiters because the bigger the planet and the closer it is to its star the larger the fraction of random orientations where we'll happen to see an eclipse and finally for direct imaging imaging an exoplanet requires suppressing the light of the nearby star by a factor of a billion in visible light for an earth or 100 million in infrared light for a super earth and this is an enormous amount of suppression that's only just possible with modern methods so to summarize there are two other methods available for detecting exoplanets there's direct imaging which is extremely challenging due to the planet's reflected light being hundreds of millions of times fainter than the starlight but it has succeeded in a few dozen instances it's more effective in the infrared than the visible because the contrast of the exoplanet reflected light is 10 or 20 times better there's also the technique of microlensing which uses a prediction of general relativity to detect a planet by the passage of a nearby star in front of a more distant star where the planet around the nearby star causes an enhanced microlensing event and this has been seen in 15 or 20 cases it's sensitive to very small mass exoplanets so is a valuable counterpart or complement to the other techniques and so we have selection methods associated with each of these techniques and really they all need to be used to bring into view the true population of [Music] exoplanets
