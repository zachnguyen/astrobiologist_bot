[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] greetings friends fellow earthlings and participants in the human data own welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life I'm your host Dr Graham Lau also known online as the cosmo biologist and we're brought to you as usual by the NASA astrobiology program and sagginnet.org thank you so much to all of you for tuning in yet again for another wonderful month on ask an astrobiologist to explore the cosmos together to meet the incredible astrobiologists from across the field who are working in different topics in this realm of understanding the nature of life now as usual before I introduce Our Guest I want to say a huge thank you to all of you out there who are watching live in the YouTube chat right now and asking questions engaging to all of you who share about our show on Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Facebook all of the other various social media places that have popped up like crazy in our data home of lately uh we want to give a big shout out this month to someone in particular sibs soccer palette who has shared about our show all across his own social media and with his own group life to and Beyond which he created as a way to share in the Journey of astrobiology I'll also mention that sibsocker is working for me this summer in the young scientist program at Blue Marble space Institute of science sibsonker is working on a project exploring research on phosphorus and its occurrence its abundance the signs of it across the solar system as a possible sign of life you may have heard recently we found evidence of phosphorus in the e ring of Saturn which it comes from the plumes erupting out of Enceladus so a lot lot more cool stuff to come there now so far on ask an astrobiologist this year we've had so many cool topics from the upcoming dragonfly mission to Titan looking into ocean worlds astrovirology science communication entrepreneurship and astrobiology so many topics and this month's guest is an expert kind of in all of them he has an extreme range of interest from exoplanetary science and origins of life to techno signatures computation information Theory and far more this month's guest is Dr Caleb Scharf Dr Scharf is an astronomer renowned science author and a highly regarded expert on a variety of topics like I just mentioned he received his bachelor's degree in physics from Durham University before going on to a PhD in astronomy from the University of Cambridge following that he then worked a little bit in x ray astronomy and observational cosmology as a postdoc at the NASA Goddard space flight center as well as the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore Maryland he then was a professor at Columbia University and led the Columbia astrobiology Center however more recently in 2022 he became the senior scientist for astrobiology at NASA's Ames Research Center and so like I said his interests span a wide range of different topics he's also written several books for like gravity's engines the zoomable universe and most recently one that I just finished the ascent of information which is a fantastic read and one I highly recommend you check out so Dr Sharp thank you and welcome to ask an astrobiologist hi well it's a pleasure to to be here today yeah I'm so excited for this episode one because I just read a remarkable book from you but I've also followed some of your writings for a long time in various Realms of conceptual ideas and topics in astrobiology you've written not just books but also in places like Scientific American and things like that you've done a lot of research across different topics but before we get to that I want to know what your origin story was what got you involved kind of in this pursuit of Science and astronomy and astrobiology in the first place yeah I I guess I'm an extreme organism when it comes to the path I've taken through science so as you mentioned I I started out in astronomy and I I studied cosmology studying large scale structure of the universe and had a pretty active career in that but I think behind a lot of my interests in science and what drove me eventually to exoplanetary science and now astrobiology it was just this puzzlement over the nature of being you know how did this happen what are we doing here and no is there anything else out there equivalent to us or or recognizably um living in the way that we are and so over time my research um veered into exoplanetary signs this was when ex Appliance were kind of a new thing in the mid 2000s and I kind of I was the rat jumping one ship and leaping on to another floating raft which was the the sudden surge in exoplanetary discoveries seemed intriguing seemed like too good an opportunity to to not follow up and that also got me into thinking about the nature of life life on planets life elsewhere and and so on so I kind of yeah I followed my notes um and but the Deep the Deep sort of puzzlement over what am I doing here what are we all doing here I think is behind it all yeah I love that there's so many questions that in astrobiology kind of take us in this realm of like philosophy and just the the human experience of being here in the first place and and so I think for all of us kind of being driven by those questions you know it's fun to kind of have a chance to explore that puzzlement as you've said now I will say so you've done some work in explanatory science and doing some x ray observations beyond the Earth uh yesterday marked the one year anniversary since the very first public data release from the jwst I'm curious what your vision kind of is for where observational astronomy is going right now do you see kind of like this like this new era of space based telescopes kind of opening up a new part of the universe we don't quite understand or how do you kind of see what jwst is doing and what the future is for observational cosmology oh that's a great question so I think you know jwst is truly remarkable I mean you know people have thrown a lot of superlatives at it and previously at the Hubble Space Telescope and and so on but it's truly remarkable because of the leap in technological ability and the fact that we through jwst we've now seen a way to build and operate giant telescopes in specs and that really I think is the future the future is leveraging what we learned about how you could build a telescope like jwst which was folded up right it was all folded up intricately assembled in its rocket and then it unfurled it unfilled its star shade it unfilled it segmented mirrors aligned those segmented mirrors to Exquisite um Precision you're seeing that we can do that means that now we have our eye on what's coming next I mean it seems a little premature because it's jwst took a long time to come to fruition and it's only just been up there for a year as you say but I think it's created this sense of um confidence if you will that we can really do this in a new way we had Hubble but Hubble in many respects was more kin to a traditional ground based telescope in terms of how it was built um how it was operated and so on and now we're beginning to see how we can build bigger and bigger telescopes and bigger and bigger telescopes mean you get to see more and more of the universe get to see further back in time in the universe and you get to look um in ever more Exquisite detail at the the smallest and faintest things including planets including the potential signatures of life on planets but it's also coincides with I don't want to you know just say it's about space based astronomy anymore you know ground based telescopes in the next 10 20 years we're going to see these giant telescopes being operated these 30 meter class telescopes that complement very beautifully what you can do in space but I share virtue of their light Gathering palette so we're kind of in an interesting point where we're sort of transitioning from some remarkable work in the past over the last many decades of space based astronomy and ground based astronomy but now there's a sort of I hesitate to say an exponential growth but there's definitely an accelerating growth in our capacity to to look at the universe well that's excellent yeah I mean so you know ground based and space based telescopes are really unfolding and opening up the universe in new ways for all of us and I really love hearing about that one thing I constantly receive emails about messages on my social media and things like that is from students who want to know which universities have the best programs in astrobiology where should they go to learn more you spend some time as the Director of the Columbia astrobiology Center and led that organization um I'm wondering you know can you give us a little pitch for why Colombia is an excellent school for pursuing astrobiology and maybe kind of your own vision of of what students might want to do if they wish to pursue something in astrobiology yeah it's a great question it's one that I've been asked many times over the years and I think the answer the answer keeps evolving to some extent uh I think you know University like Colombia or other places like University of Washington and Seattle or in Arizona you'll have efforts in astrobiology and astrobiology education that are all really great they're robust and they're they're multi layered and there are many many opportunities for students to be engaged but they're all slightly different as well and this is one of the challenges with if you want to pursue astrobiology you know watch what should you study because there's biology there's astronomy there's physics there's computer science there's everything and that does make it challenging especially if you're an undergrad or a graduate working towards your your dream of of studying the questions in astrobiology and so you know it's a question of finding places that Veer towards your particular your interest so Columbia University for example veered a little bit towards understanding the nature of planetary climate and its correspondence to things like habitability and the possibility of life on on different worlds and also studying the history of our solar system other places veered towards looking at microbial life looking at Analog environments here on the earth in Antarctica or Atacama and so on so you know the beautiful thing about astrobiology is if there's a particular angle to it that intrigues you the most you should be able to find somewhere that can support that interest and in terms of you know what you should learn you should learn everything unfortunately you should not see this as an easy an easy get out kind of career choice but having said that it's perfectly fine to start by focusing on a more traditional area like astronomy like microbiology like geophysics become reasonably expert in that and then diversify it then add to your portfolio take new courses take a master's degree or in your in your graduate work focus in on something that doesn't have to be perfectly aligned with what you studied before that's kind of it's not necessarily the best advice but that's kind of what I say to people is keep your eyes open keep asking people find the people who have that common interest they're surprising places where people are doing this work I love that yeah I often remind students in astrobiology you have to be a specialist as well as a generalist a specialist in something but a generalist in almost everything but you know now with modern Technologies we are finding ways to extend our own memories our capabilities for storing information and that kind of brings me to your book the ascent of information which again I think was a remarkable read I love you start off talking about visiting you know Shakespeare's grave site and seeing the Epitaph on the grave a curse of what might happen should you move his bones you explore you know our our transition as a species in developing information storing information through time the way we can look back through time to things like cuneiform and learn more from that data that those data have more relevance in some ways to our modern day for us to understand those people back then than they were really using it for at that time you explore information storage and really you know the way that this non genetic information out there is kind of kind of stored um you know previously you've written about black holes the zoomable universe exoplanets what inspired you to write the ascent of information yeah it's a good question and actually I can point to astrobiology as the sort of origin Point um I it was a few years ago and I was going to give a talk about the search for technological intelligent life in the universe and it got me to thinking about well what do we really mean when we say that our species for example is intelligent it's often it's often not obvious that that's the case by the colloquial definition um but also technological and I was trying to think is there some Universal quality that we have that we could apply elsewhere and it got me to realize that we have this informational world that we've constructed around ourselves and we've been constructing that since there were modern humans around biologically modern humans whether it's on the wall of a cave or in the clay tablets or or in in oral Traditions whatever and that information propagates through time with us and it evolves and it grows but it's not encoded in our genes and that struck me as a pretty unique Market of your intelligence or technology or a way to gauge a difference between species Like Us and other species that exist on the earth that seemingly don't have anything quite like that and that so that was driven by you know an astrobiological question which is how do we look for intelligence or technology in in the universe and then as I thought more and more about it I started to realize wow this is a big thing this is a really interesting and perhaps critical aspect of our existence to understand for astrobiology but also for us as a species because that informational World which I ended up calling the data ohm in in sort of homage to genome um you know it comes with its benefits but it also comes with burdens and as I followed This Thread it made me think more and more that actually in a sense it's almost like an alternate living system here on Earth came out of us it evolved with us it's continuing to evolve and it's it's a give and take between us and it it's energetically demanding resource demanding um but it also benefits us um yeah one quote from the very beginning of the book that I really loved you say that our species is drenched in data and then you explore a lot of the actual data of like the just sheer numbers of how much information we have from the collected characters in all of the recorded uh forms of Shakespeare that are out there in the world to how we are currently storing information you know on servers around the planet in Silicon and just in crazy numbers um to develop this data ohm now one thing we wanted to know from our audience just for fun we we poked a little bit and said is information a form of life and we put a poll out there and most people said either maybe or no we had a few responses that information is a characteristic of Life as we know it but it can't you know it can't exist as a it can exist as a non living context as well and so I'm kind of curious for your vision of a data owner do you see the data own being just for like a species or or population for a biosphere do you think there will be multiple data ohms in the universe eventually kind of going through their own evolutionary processes together how do you envision this data own kind of you know in a conceptual way it's a really good question and I think it's it's still something I'm trying to figure out trying to pin down I think um you know where I ended up with in thinking about what's happening here on Earth is you know to look at the date home you also have to look at what biology really is and many people have said and I think many of us accept almost without thinking about it the fact that biology at its core is an informational process is about the the propagation and evolution of information in our genes our genome is we know that's data right it's information that leads to all the structures that make make an organism and it persists through time but it also changes through time and so at a very very deep level biology is already informational and I think that suggests that something like the data ohm that's externalized information is basically the same stuff it's just found a new way to express itself in the world a new way to expand it's found a a an opening if you will to escape from its biological constraints and and get into other structures of matter and that suggests to me that Across the Universe if if there are other things out there akin to living systems that this may well have happened elsewhere and then you get to a point of asking that it relates to I mean this is a very popular thing people talk about whether you know there's life out there that's purely a machine right and it relates to that that question in as much as you have to wonder does it happen let's say to a species like this eventually and it may not happen immediately science fiction loves this idea of the singularity that you know one day we wake up and the robots have taken over and we're gone right the Terminator scenario but maybe it's slower than that maybe it happens over time and more and more of these informational processes just wind up in forms that are not biological so Across the Universe you could find living systems in many different stages and there may be ones that are purely data ohm they're just information and I suspect it isn't going to look like our vision of that it's not going to be robots and computers the way we think about it'll be some other some other mechanism for the information to instantiate instantiate itself in the world so then yeah do those data homes communicate with each other right we're interested in seti here and that's great and that's interesting but maybe out there are data ohms have figured out how to talk to each other blend merge grow they may not be physically connected they don't need to be physically connected you know information will find a way you know the old um line from Jurassic Park life will find a way that gets overused well I think that's actually wrong I think it's information will find a way because we've seen that happen again and again here in the nature of life on Earth and now with our data yeah and so that's kind of where I wanted to go next to was talking about this idea of you know how the information finds a way as well as you know this idea of like the Transcendence through a singularity we had Dr Sue Schneider on the show back in 2019 uh Dr Schneider is now at Florida Atlantic University she studies Transcendence in the future of the human mind and and things like you know Ai and Tech and stuff like that and when she and I were speaking we talked a lot about whether or not most alien life would be post biological you know over that Singularity over that hump whatever it is and you recently had this article you published in Scientific American exploring this idea you just presented of more of a blended you have a transition but one thing you said in that article that I want to highlight is that Blended living systems are the only ones able to discover other living systems um can you expand on that idea for our audience a little bit well why you think they're the only ones that might discover other living yeah yeah so that that little article was actually um came out of a piece of scientific research that I've been working on that actually was itself inspired fired by the ideas of the the date home that's to do with the nature of computation as a biological uh as at the core of of biology and the fact that we can um gauge the energetic requirements of that but yeah this idea of the Blended Blended life being the only life that can find other life in the universe so it's you know it's a little bit of a frivolous statement um but you know the idea is that if you're just biologic right if you're just cats and dogs right you might be interested in somewhere in there you might have an interest in life beyond you know your your park or your your planet but you know you have no means of answering those questions about life elsewhere if you're not technological if you don't have a substantial sort of amount of externalized information on on the other hand if you're a pure machine life you probably don't care right you probably just pass you know what what are you going to learn from stupid biology right I mean I'm being a little facetious but um for the sake of argument um even though you have the technological capacity to to look for life it's the stuff in the middle like us where the biological piece of us is still really interested and feels like it needs to know that answer and we're beginning to to have the the Machinery around us the technological Tools around us to answer that question so it may be that it's only stuff like us that is ever gonna both have the question and have the capacity to go looking for answers and that's probably true across the universe as well and that's kind of interesting because maybe we'll never encounter those post biological species just because they don't care anymore they're not even trying right they're doing their own thing it's the stuff like us that is still hungry and has the capacity to to look yeah indeeda one thing that you bring up in the book that kind of touched me a little bit given the nature of human history and how through Warfare and various issues we've we've gone after each other's information we've gone after each other's cultural history our understanding of ourselves you know people have tried to replace the past with their own understanding of who they are and replace the message of previous people and you know we have this tendency as a species to want to share our history you know just like Shakespeare having an Epitaph on his grave we have tombstones around the world that have epitaphs on them too to signify the passing of those people that we've loved and cared for on Earth we have Gene bangs and Seed vaults and we've sent out Interstellar messages in the Voyager spacecraft and the Pioneer spacecraft and and some of us are even contemplating how can we send messages into the stars for aliens to know who and what we are right now um and you mentioned in the book towards the end you mentioned this idea of like a billion year old data ohm that might contain kind of informational fossils of species who kind of come and gone within that data ohm itself and how things have changed through time um I wonder if you think part of the data ohm for us in and of itself is driven by that human feeling that we have that we need to we need to have some remembrance of who we are or who we've been through time um and how important that is for us as a species yeah it's a really it's really beautiful insight and good question yeah I think I think there are two pieces to it I I think there there's the definitely there's a sort of human emotional side to this a sense of you know to make to allow us to understand who we are and to feel robust in our identity we look to the Past constantly right you know who are my parents where did I come from what was my origin story and and so on um and we look deeper and deeper into that as a sort of emotional support but then in terms of evolution in terms of our success as a species our capacity to continue there's no doubt that you know that sort of strata in our data oh right the fact that we can talk about civilizations writing on clay tablets or we can talk about you know people building pyramid structures in South America or or in the Middle East you know means that our data home has these layers of information from the past it is a time machine in many respects at any given instant it's a time machine right it doesn't contain the future it always contains the past and that's a pretty special thing for a species and this is also why I think we have to be mindful of what we're putting into it right and and as you say right we as a we our history says that we're very good at making things up distorting the truth altering what we perceive to be in history for our own um own uh needs or or wants and we have to be careful about that not just because of what it does now but what it's going to mean in the future if we contaminate our data home with too much nonsense today and this is a possible problem with things like generative AIS and chat GPT and so on um we're making it harder and harder for the future versions of us to figure out who they are what they are and to make reference to this useful information that can inform you know future decisions now there's so much to unpack there and uh for our audience watching right now live on YouTube please ask your questions for Dr Scharf in the chat um if you want I could pepper use some ideas that I would ask after that I would ask about like roku's basilisk or informational time travel there's so much to unpack but I do want to ask before we get into our faster than light segment about your current role now you are now the senior scientist for astrobiology at NASA's Ames Research Center uh what is that role going to entail for you moving forward in your career yeah another great question um you know it's it's it's quite a responsibility and challenge um so you know NASA's aims Research Center has long been at the epicenter of astrobiological research I mean it really has back to sort of day one back in late 1950s when this new topic of exobiology emerged as people um became aware of you know as we send things into space and bring things back we need to worry about what we're sending and what we're bringing back and some of that could be living systems so Amos has this wonderful history and Legacy in astrobiology and many many active researchers right now working in questions of Life detection and life characterization here on Earth on Mars I see moons in our solar system also in exoplanetary science and so part of my role here is to see where we can take all of this how can we keep going with this extraordinary Legacy and build on it um play an even bigger role in many of the the missions that NASA puts together to start to develop more of our own astrobiological missions I think we're entering an era of true astrobiology missions so spacecraft and probes that are explicitly all about astrobiology so part of my role is to to talk to people to gather ideas to come up with ideas to help help steer this wonderful ship to new and exciting places that's wonderful and how do you envision artificial intelligence machine learning computation being a part of that so one of the projects that I'm very interested in and I'm trying to spin up a few elements of this at Ames at the moment is is the application of AI and machine learning in astrobiology and the reason for that is you know obviously machine learning tools are now in use Across The Sciences as well as in other fields in industry and so on but astrobiology is kind of an interesting topic when it comes to machine learning because astrobiology perhaps more than any other field is this quest for understanding extraordinarily complex systems multivariate multi correlated variables in in living systems and the interaction of living systems with planetary environments and so on so if there was ever a problem that required the capabilities of sophisticated machine learning I think it's astrobiology this ability of algorithms to program themselves to learn to find subtle correlations to find relationships that we humans even if we're trained May sometimes struggle to find and to also be agnostic to not come with too many preconceptions if we're careful in how we design and run our machine learning algorithms so I think this is a really extraordinary opportunity and so it aims we're spinning up some projects involved in both providing tools and resources for people in astrobiology who are interested in the application of AI and machine learning but also some of our own projects and applications very cool now I I did put out a post on my own Twitter last night just asking people of the various topics that you've worked in what their interests were I offered exoplanetary science information Theory the origins of life or something else like techno signatures and other Realms that you've worked on the largest percentage about 40 percent of those who responded were interested in your work in exoplanetary science and I think that's been a big driver for a lot of people you know much like yourself when I was a kid we didn't have any evidence of exoplanets we didn't know for sure if they were out there and then we started finding them and automatically had to change our known models of how planets form and how planets can even migrate and move through solar systems and and things like this so a lot has changed I'm curious where your work is in the realm of exoplanets currently yeah so um yeah exoplanetary science is still near and dear to my heart um and of course it's essential as we as we grow our astrobiological Quest so some of the work that I'm engaged with at the moment um is to do with understanding um or continuation of work underst to do with understanding the nature of climate systems on Rocky exoplanets and in particular right now with a colleague also at Nasa at The Goddard Institute for space studies we're we're starting up an investigation what I call Photon harvesting on planets and that means looking at the detailed nature of irradiance on the surface so the photons that come from a parent star get filtered through planetary atmosphere they also get reflected because of clouds and clouds Shadow the surface and we haven't really looked much at what that implies in terms of photosynthetic or phototrophic life on the surface of a planet if photons are it's food how much of those does it get and where do those land on the surface of the planet so we're looking at that in a more detailed way than I think has been done before using these sophisticated um three dimensional computer models of planetary climate for world or not the Earth will have different day lengths or different orbital configurations or different Land Ocean configurations you know where are the best places for photosynthetic life on those worlds and can we then map that to biosignatures because photosynthetic life on Earth at least is the the prime generator of oxygen okay oxygen is a waste product and um that therefore will relate to the level of photosynthetic activity so that's one thing I'm looking at I have some other projects I have a very cute little project where we're actually modeling how ejector from asteroid impacts on exoplanets might propagate through the system so when a big asteroid hits a planet it will often spew material back out into space and that material will enter orbits around the parent star happens in our own solar system it's why we find Martian meteorites here on Earth some asteroid hit Mars in the past and bits of that Collision have ended up here so we're actually applying a sophisticated gravitational simulator to other planetary systems including some well known exoplanet systems a system called Trappist trappist 1 which has a whole bunch of potentially rocky planets in tight orbits around the parent start and it's really interesting we're seeing the transfer of material over thousands of years between those planets and possibly even at least in the simulations the leakage of planetary material to Interstellar space that's kind of cool because that means you can take an evolved planet and if you hit it hard enough some of that evolved Planet ends up leaking out to travel in interstellar space and who knows where it goes after that so those are a couple of the areas that I'm I'm studying at the moment it's very cool quantifying pan spermia is a very cool idea I like that a lot so but before we move on to our fast of the light segment there's one thing I want to share I there's this very famous quote from Arthur C Clarke that he says there are two possibilities either we are alone in the universe or we are not and that's very much still true based on current evidence however there's often a part of that quote that follows after that could go two ways and I've heard it both ways from Michio keku and and from various people through time that either it's quite staggering or either it's quite terrifying and so I asked on Twitter you know what people think is the concept of us being alone or not staggering or terrifying and over 50 percent of respondents said it was staggering but interestingly about a quarter of respondents wanted to say something else they said words like exhilarating annoying thrilling humbling electrifying exciting fascinating amazing crazy logical inspiring or isolating and I'm curious Dr Sharp if you know this concept of us being alone or not if you could pick a single kind of term or phrase that you think represents this this idea of of the potential for things out there what kind of word do you think best describes this wow maybe wow is the word you know it would I guess intriguing if we were if this was the only place in the observable universe where life had happened that would be truly intriguing absolutely I love that yeah it's intriguing too if we're not alone I mean it tells us a lot as well so I agree and it plays on our human curiosity a lot so before I get to our audience q a I know we have a bunch of questions coming in from the YouTube chat right now I promise for our audience I'll get to those very soon but first we have our faster than light segment so these are just some short fun questions that we love to ask all of our guests to kind of see what various astrobiologists from across the field are thinking first off uh in this realm of whether or not we are alone what is your favorite answer to fermi's question where are they so I guess my favorite answer is we just haven't looked hard enough right the answer is that I can't give you an answer because we haven't done enough work to really look it's kind of surprising sometimes to people but even seti has really just studied a drop of you know in an ocean of data and of a wide parameter space We've Only Just Begun We've Only Just Begun the task um I agree entirely um what stories have inspired you to want to explore more about life in the universe so I'm going to sound very cliched science fiction has played a big role um you know stories by people like Arthur C Clarke um or modern stories e m Banks Ursula Guin uh Becky Chambers uh Alistair Reynolds stories that are sort of tend towards more towards the hard science fiction um that really speculate and ask the ask the the big questions but I should also say that I've been inspired by stories like Darwin's voyage on the Beagle reading Darwin's Diary of his voyages on the Beagle the idea that someone can be thrown into this extraordinary circumstance of exploration that really nobody had experience before to go around the world in the way that he did um really inspiring really interesting and it also reminds you that it takes a very particular mind to do this to a bead so observant and so curious to get something out of this wonderful if you could go back in time and visit yourself at the start of your career what advice would you give yourself enjoy it more you know science is tough and um I don't think I'm a typical mind if there is such a thing as a typical mind and that can be challenging and so you know I think if I went back to my younger self I would try to say you know enjoy the moment enjoy what you're doing right now don't worry too much whether or not it seems like it's gonna Forge a career for you just do it and enjoy it and then get on with the next thing awesome so this kind of comes more to your your own expertise in the realm of astrobiology if there is alien life out there do you think we'll Discover it first in our own solar system or on exoplanets Far Away okay I think the first definitive evidence of other life will happen in our solar system but I think that what may happen first before that definitive evidence is the acquisition of plausible evidence from exoplanet studies there you go um there's so much potential uh either way so the final question in our faster than light segment what's an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind okay this is a big one so I and it still keeps me awake at night sometimes 13.8 billion years ago the universe was really boring it was basically the same everywhere it had almost no structure to it Mata was just this this unstructured stuff everywhere yet somehow 13.8 billion years later the universe has built structures out of itself of increasing complexity that have got to the point where those structures can turn around and observe the fact that they have come from this universe and even learn about that that origin 13.8 billion years ago that to me I just how does that happen how does it it how do you go from no structure no sentience no anything to universe that at least in one place has sentient um sentience being sentient structures built out of that Universe capable of recognizing that very same fact um I love it yeah we are we are the universe going to know itself right um so let's go to our audience q a now for those watching live on YouTube please ask your questions if you're watching the recording later uh you can feel free to ask ask questions I will try my best to answer those myself but they're not live for Dr Scharf right now let's start off with a question from Twitter from user at Philo Logan uh Paul schrum they want to know what's common in information Theory between DNA RNA proteome and computer science uh what's different between those things and basically I guess they're asking for information Theory how can we relate like our genome our proteome to the data ohm yeah it's a it's a great question um so there are a number of aspects to this one is that we think there's a universal limit on how much energy is required to ever change something in the world to flip a bit right to make an irreversible change of a one to a zero or zero to a one and we also think that limit applies to everything including biology and there have been some studies made that indicate biology actually works very close to that energy limit it's a thing called the land hour limit and it essentially comes from information Theory and it comes from an investigation of how entropy changes when you change the state of something flipper one to a zero or vice versa and it turns out that things like amino acids being co joined to make a protein as a strand of RNA is being read out the energy for each of those individual computations or information changes is very very close to that land hour limit so that's one example of where the sort of deeper thinking about the nature of information from physics and thermodynamics seems to perhaps tell us something about what can happen in biology the absolute limits of things in biology um but on equally we can look at the propagation of more you know complex information in biology and the idea of again computation in biology all of which can be informed by things like information Theory there's been beautiful work done for example on um thinking about darwinian Evolution and information why does life get more complex well more complex life can process more information about its environment and make in principle better decisions that lead to Greater survivability and so there's been some beautiful mathematical work people like David Krakow the Santa Fe Institute have worked on this really co joining all of these rather abstract seeming ideas about information information Theory to biology and ultimately to the the functioning of DNA and RNA why do we have our information packaged that way and there seem to be some answers from information Theory very cool uh user Mr Phoenix 27 on YouTube wants to know what you think are the most promising methods or Technologies for detecting and analyzing biosignatures on exoplanets great question uh yeah so for exoplanets there's there's quite a range of things we can do and I think that that range is growing so one is a topic that many many people are putting a lot of effort in to understand and that is the nature of um the chemical composition of planetary atmospheres and I think that remains one of the the preeminent options for us for finding evidence of life on other worlds so for example the mix of things like oxygen and methane and nitrogen compounds and carbon dioxide water in our own atmosphere is a consequence of the biosphere that particular balance and the flux the ever changing sort of nature of that right oxygen comes and goes from the atmosphere carbon dioxide comes and goes from the atmosphere those are things that we think we can discriminate between that happening because of life and because of non biological processes and it's something that with space telescopes in particular jwst and future telescopes we think we have a shot at detecting those compounds in the atmospheres of rocky planets that might resemble the Earth we think that's perhaps our best shot right now at doing this there are other things that may come down the line to do with determining um the color of planets the Spectra of planets the detailed sort of pigmentation if you will of planets and that pigmentation is correlated with life um correlated with photosynthetic life and other types of life on the planetary surface so I think right now those are two promising areas the challenge is building the technology that lets us see those things because these are seen across white ears it's really really difficult to do this but we're getting that we're getting that yeah absolutely I mean our telescopes are microscopes so the scientific tools we're developing are letting us peer further and further away to structures that are humongous to down to structures that are extremely small exploring scales with space and time indeed um one of our production assistants asked the question uh so amaroop jumped in the chat because he's curious since you mentioned earlier that pyramids are an example of a data ohm we mentioned other things that are part of our data Omen information he's curious what you think of like ant hills and corals I'll even add in termite mounds and other you know uses of biology for creating structure that we see um where do we kind of draw that line in intelligence adding information into the data ohm yeah it's a really good question it's it's one I've sort of struggled a bit with to understand and where that dividing line is yeah an ant hill right ants well termites build these extraordinary structures some of which are engineering Feats not just because they exist because they do things like regulate temperature they seem you know the termites seem to understand the nature of um you know ideal gas laws and what happens when a wind blows across your your mound and so on and and they continue to build those those structures over time I think one would look at that as a type of data ohm but rather a limited one compared to the nature of the the human date home you know in evolutionary biology people talk about the extended phenotype right so the phenotype is is what you get when genes Express themselves and build proteins extended phenotype is arguably the fact that you you know you go and build a an ant hill or you know I go and do something else in in the world and the interesting thing about it is is this Loop and I think perhaps just sort of you know because I can't answer your question that well I'm going to switch it to say well the interesting thing is there's this feedback loop and this is something we didn't mention earlier about the data um you know it changes our environment right and the antio changes the environment for the ants and there's this extraordinary feedback loop that it suddenly you know if the environment is different natural selection is going to be different and so then that natural selection changes maybe how they build the ant hill in the Next Generation and so on and so on so maybe the line is somewhere in there to the the extent to which evolution is altered and Modified by that sort of externalized expression of information excellent um someone named today in space on YouTube has asked what your thoughts are on how we might approach a first Contact if we have one cautiously yeah it's it's a good question and obviously a lot of people have thought about this I'm not an expert or or super knowledgeable about what people have discussed but you know these have been serious discussions about you know perhaps the biggest challenge is this is something I have thought about is you know new information can be dangerous right you have to be careful um suppose the message from the aliens that we decode says we are coming to eat you right what what is that going to do to us now the aliens may not have meant that or it may be a form of endearment right who knows um so you know in this even simpler form just knowing that there's other life out there especially if it's so I think there's a distinction between microbial type life simple life versus life that might actually talk to us I think you know the challenge of uh sort of revealing that there's bacteria on Mars is much lower a much lower challenge a much lesser Challenge and much less sort of disruptive than revealing that message that yeah you know the aliens have said they're coming to eat us so people have worried about protocols they've worried about fairness right because chances are you know putting aside the sort of microbial life but if it's let's say a signal from somewhere that seti succeeds after all this time you know who will have that detection will it be one nation will it be all nations will it be one culture will it be all cultures you know how do we disseminate this in a way that's fair but also doesn't create um problems so it's a great question I don't have a particularly good answer to it I know that for modern astrobiology where we're talking about just detecting the existence of living systems like microbes on mars or signatures in exoplanetary atmospheres there has been a lot of work in the last couple of years on not a protocol exactly but the the standards of evidence that are used right it's very easy to say that you think you've found life and then it's all over the media and it blows out a proportion and there are a lot of subtleties to those statements and so as a scientific Community there is work going on to try to do a better job of saying what is robust what you can draw from this evidence you know what the next steps are and so on and try to do it in a nuanced way so that people understand more understand the science more wonderful so our next question I kind of want to change gears with a little bit so Hendrick Holst has asked uh what kind of chlorophyll or pigments I think he meant uh would evolved to utilize infrared light or UV light from different kinds of stars they can orbit around um you know I mentioned this idea of like Photon harvesting you know and where we get energy around certain stars but um for answering that I kind of want to want to push back then to your article you published just recently where you mentioned this concept of computational zones and where the energy might be kind of available for computation so I wonder and kind of answering this question of you know what kind of pigments might develop to use different wavelengths of energy that are available around you know available around certain Stars if you can also speak to this idea that you mentioned in your Scientific American article of a computational Zone what that means yeah um yeah okay so there are kind of two things in there so the pigment question is a really good question and people have studied this and thought about this and we've also learned that here on Earth there are organisms that use a variety of pigmentations or pigment molecules to absorb light and there is evidence that some type of photosynthesis can occur using infrared photons as evidence of and when I say photosynthesis in this context I really mean you know the utilization of energy to propel chemistry inside organisms there's some evidence that that can happen around hydrothermal vent systems in the Deep oceans the hydrothermal vent systems are hot so there are infrared photons being emitted and people have also studied what might happen around a different type of stuff and some of that work suggests that the better pigments are going to make everything look black so plants you know if you have plant life photosynthetic plant life growing around a low mass so called M dwarf star which is very red in its Spectrum you may have much much darker pigmentation to optimize the capture of photons and then yeah this idea of you know again generalizing all of these processes by which life gathers energy and then does stuff with it so this idea of computation or computational zones that I've played with with my colleagues is really trying to say well you know there are many things you have to pull together to understand what give you know the conditions that make life possible there's temperature because of chemistry and it also applies to presence of liquid water for our type of biology but there's also has to be a supply of energy there also has to be a supply of bits and pieces Lego blocks you know the substrate out of which life is built and traditionally it's quite hard to pull those different threads together we have people who are experts in metabolism which is the Gathering and utilization of energy but we also then we have you know the exoplanet people who are experts in planetary climate and whether or not you can have liquid water on the surface it's hard to pull those threads together but thinking about life in terms of the core computational processes may give us a way to do this because those core computational processes require um a certain amount of free energy and this goes back to that idea of the land hour limit that we talked about before that there's always a certain amount of energy required to perform computation and that energy limit is turns out to be related to temperature environmental temperature so we can begin to blend together the existence of energy to drive biology with the the temperature of the environment which is a major measure of the nature of it environment then we can look at the flow of substrates of elements that are used to build life so the computational Zone tries to you know recast things and one thing it says is we shouldn't be so prejudiced about wanting life to exist exactly in the conditions that we find on the earth free energy for example you can use for computation you may be able to use energy in every different Wave band from x ray down to you know infrared photons even into radio waves there's no reason not to so one of the things we're exploring with that idea because it kind of releases you from some constraints is you know is it better for computation to use infrared photons is it at you know we're not saying how you do the computation but just in general Universal terms or is it better to do it the way that it happens here on Earth I love that so much um so much to explore and so many fun conceptual ideas we have so many more incredible questions coming in from our audience but unfortunately not enough time to ask them all so for those asking questions in the chat right now uh please take your questions online for myself or Dr Sharp if you can ask them elsewhere there's one question that came in that I think we can finish with here from sip soccer palette who asked for your your uh perspective on how we might communicate with aliens given that you know we can't or now we kind of have a loose level of communication with other forms of life here on Earth um you know we've barely really begun understanding what intelligence is whether or not other organisms have a similar intelligence let alone Consciousness which is way out there um and so I think soccer kind of wants to know what your vision is of how we might even approach communication with intelligent alien life it's a it's a great and very challenging question um you know so again it's not it's not an area of my particular expertise but I guess um yeah I think you know one of the challenges I find in thinking about that question is we're so predisposed to the things we've seen in popular culture right every movie we have to talk to the aliens you know even the beautiful movie like arrival where it's all in in um diagrams and pictograms and and so on you know we may have to actually start with just the rudiments of the nature of reality cause and effect you know if I do this this happens so let's see you do that and make that happen and then we build from there the rudiments of logic in other words maybe the best place to start it may be the way to avoid misunderstanding that's my two cents love it yeah finding some way to have some kind of Common Ground showing what we know of ourselves in the universe um I love that so much Dr Sharp thank you so much for joining us for ask an astrobiologist today my pleasure this has been a lot of fun now I will say to our audience I
