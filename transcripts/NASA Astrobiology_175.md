hear me oh it's very exciting spent a lot of time all the organizing not everyone's here but you'll certainly throughout the con um but yeah it's just so exciting to see faces all the names so um thank you so much for coming um and we're just so happy to be here and glad everyone could make it hey everyone my name is Miguel and I'm a PhD student here at Scripps and I'm the co lead organizer of app gradcon this year with this beautiful team it's been quite so you can actually decided to apply to host I've gradcon in September so it's been crazy eight months and most of all we're very excited to have all of you here today and that said we're already on the search for the host for next app gradcon so I've gradcon 2024 so if you're interested in hosting next year just come and chat with us in the next couple days we'll be able to give you an idea of what it entails and without further Ado I want to introduce tonight's keynote speaker Dr Karen G Lloyd who is a subsurface microbiologist at the University of Tennessee although in 2024 she will be the the Wrigley professor of Earth Sciences at the University of Southern California Dr Lloyd discovers new types of life in Arctic permafrost what kind of volcanic hot spring systems and deepsea environments she combines geochemistry with metabolomics meta transcriptomics metagenomics and other environmental measurements to infer what life is like in natural complex systems let's welcome Dr Campbell foreign thanks thanks for having me y'all and I went to AB gradcon here um would that have been like 2005 I think it's a as a attendee so it's kind of nice to be back um speaking um so I'm going to talk about um life inside Earth's crust but one of the reasons why we study life in Earth's crust is that we obviously the reason we're all here is that we want to find life outside of earth that is something that it's really kind of nice to give a talk here because I don't have to justify that like we all agree that is a thing worth doing so um when I think where is light so where okay yeah these are some good places right like I've named some nice planetary bodies that seem like a place you could find some stuff but where in them do we expect to find some stuff well the place we know the most about on these planetary bodies is the surface and I'm not saying there's not life there definitely not I mean that would be ridiculous but there's not like the Amazon rainforest sitting up there we would have seen it if it was up there um so it doesn't seem to be like teeming on the surface but the subsurface if you think about the subsurfaces of all of these places it's a pretty Clement place to be there's often liquid water at least in the case of Europa and Enceladus there's whole oceans worth of water so that's cool that's a major thing ticked off our list protection from UV damage there's tons of stuff to build cells with it's kind of a nice place to be um and the evidence for this is that I don't know if you keep up with methane on Mars but this has been something that's been kind of controversial over the years and now is no longer controversial it is definitely there we have methane in the Martian atmosphere and the thing that I love the most about this methane is that it's not always there we get whiffs of it and so this this is something that seems very lifelike to me if you know Titan Titan is so full of methane you're like is that really biological but for for Mars it seems kind of biological so I wonder if right now there's a subsurface life ecosystem happening on Mars right now it could be and Europa Europa is really easy right like this is this lovely artist rendering if I had the artists that NASA does I would get so much funding um but they've got this ice cap and then these occasional Jets Enceladus definitely has jets and absolutely for 100 sure there's a giant ocean of liquid probably saline water on Europa which is just very intriguing okay so a high probability shot for astrobiology is to look for life in the subsurface of planetary bodies so we've got this planet to look for so can we use Earth life the life we find here is a guide for what might be there on the subsurface of these other planetary bodies and I don't know if you guys ever do this view of Earth do you ever try to get the to get the land out you know it's like Hawaii and New Zealand you know California is fighting them to to gain place but I love looking at Earth like this because it really reminds you that we are an ocean planet we know that but you can you can look at it from the back side and some of my colleagues have added up the total number of microbial cells that are living underneath the ocean in the subsurface in the Marine sediments and it's literally astronomical it's 10 to the 29 which is a third of the microbes on the planet are buried in the subsurface underneath our oceans which is 10 000 times more than the number of stars in the universe um although that number has a big error bar on it too um so actually most of the life on Earth is actually inside Earth so we are a subsurface Planet too and if you look at the terrestrial environment um this has pretty much the same amount of microbes in it so it's not just the oceans this stuff is kind of everywhere um okay so but if you think about microbes and life inside Earth's crust our dominant signal is things like the Amazon rainforest there's no question that this planet has tons of surface life so you have to ask the question is it real you know like what are all those little creepy crawlies are they meant to be there or are they just like the leftovers um you know it can be dangerous to assume that an organism is optimized to live just where you found it um I have this really self deprecating anecdote hopefully um you guys will get so I I did a um the geobiology the agaron geobiology summer course which is now at Penn State do you guys know about this it's fantastic you should look into it if you don't know about it it's a um I think it's six week summer course and this year it's going to be in Italy is anybody going no okay it's gonna be great Jen mcelady is running it it's Penn State's first year so maybe it's a rocky first year go next year um but I I did that in the second year that it was ever around and we went to Yellowstone for our field trip and I was just like so full of wonder and like my eyes were saucers and I was taking in everything that I could and I was watching in this hot spring I was watching a spider in a hot spring and I was like oh my God this place is Magic even the spiders are adapted to high temperature and I was just watching this spider just like you know cool just like chilling in this hot spring just thinking oh my God I need to work on arachnids like I gotta switch my whole thing and do you know where this story is going right it died I watched the thing died it just like curled up and then I was like oh my God Karen you're such an idiot you know but that that we have to be conscious of that like are we just looking at something that's kind of not really supposed to be there well I I would like to convince you in this talk that that is not true for the subsurface it's got a lot more going for it than a spider in a hot spring um so here's my my list of evidence that the Deep biosphere on Earth is real alive and not just leftovers from the sub from the surface first of all there's a lot of energy sources in the subsurface it's not just like Marine sediments that are sort of piling up so um I see this figure a lot um but it's nice because it encapsulates a lot of different environments so we've got polar regions underneath glaciers we have deep anoxic brines we have a hydrothermal vents we of course have Marine sediments which cover so much of the planet we have subduction zones we have serpentinizing environments we have volcanic adjacent areas and then we have human made areas as well for for human made environments all of these things are are places where you can find nutrients to drive a subsurface biosphere so that's that's one thing it's got going for it the other thing is that when we look at what's down there we actually see evidence that these things are breathing that they're alive because we can see the chemical signature that they leave um and if you are a marine sediment person like I am you live and breathe these kind of diagrams but if you're not if you look at small what is it faint things next to bright things in the atmosphere then maybe you're not used to looking at stuff like this but this is this is my life um this is up here that's the ocean up there this is the surface of the mud and we're just like looking down into the muck and look at the depth scale on this this is meters so this is like drilling a football field worth down so this is a massive drilling operation um and then if you measure you section this thing into sections and you measure the concentrations of in this case sulfate as you go down and then methane as well the fact that this is curved like this and we can measure the sedimentation rate we can use those two factors and then just what we know about diffusion and compaction and basic things like that to calculate the rate at which these organisms are breathing the sulfate and the fact that it's shaped that it's got this concave shape means that somebody was breathing it you can't really get that shape unless you have upward infection of sulfate free fluids which we don't have in this situation so um this is evidence that these things are breathing and they're alive um and it's not like the stuff we find down there is just surface stuff that's hanging on um it's its own thing so if you do this is a easiest way to show this is one of my colleagues papers um this is a non met non multi what's nmds what does that stand for non multi dimensional scaling parametric test um this is a uh axis less axes but all you have to know to understand these data are the dots that are close together have more similar microbial communities and dots that are farther apart have more different microbial communities so all the seawater grouped together and all the Marine sediment group together and anybody who works in seawater and sediment just knows this intuitively we have almost no overlap in the types of microbes we find in these places so it's its own thing and then the last thing is much harder to show and I've spent a lot of my career and my students in my lab have worked on this um how do you show they're actually adapted to live in this place that's that's been a little more I'll spend a little bit more time talking about this because it's a bit more nuanced um but I'll first not go into the whole story but just talk about one of my graduate students Jordan bird took samples from an iotp expedition on the great shipment Nisha not the geordie's resolution which which the Baltic Sea and drilled hundreds of meters into the Baltic Sea and he combined meta transcriptomes metabolomes if you don't work with those things we basically if you think about like a cell as a bag of biomolecules like DNA RNA proteins lipids and all that kind of stuff and then all the chemicals that get pushed Along by those processes if you take a natural sample and you pull all those chemicals out and then just say well what was there then you can kind of back calculate what that cell was doing you can reconstruct how these organisms were actually functioning and that's the kind of stuff we do and so from that we found that it looks like they do have some adaptations to being there so we can see some actual chemical evidence not just in genes so remember this is why I'm sort of harping on this is that you can predict a lot of things from genes but we saw actual evidence that these functions were happening we saw a DNA repair that consumes NAD which is a cofactor that gets redox cycled in a cell but in this case is using for getting used for DNA repair we found an accumulation of osmo protectants so this is not a particularly saline place we kind of think that collecting things like triolose inside cells is a lot about shutting down and slowing down the cells like pickling themselves and we were able to find we discovered ecology which maybe doesn't sound like such an exciting thing to find but when you're dealing with an ecosystem that might kind of be dead finding ecological niches is a great little indicator that they're actually alive so we found that microbe a eats food a and micro b eats food B and we've showed that with functional assays which still blows my mind that that actually worked so this may be something that they do to not fight because basically when you don't have a lot of resources and nobody gets to come in and nobody gets to leave if you compete then it's mutually assured destruction if you kill that cell it's never getting another one um and then we found this one group if you are a microbiologist this might make sense to you the atro bacteria which is a deeply branching uncultured clade we think it eats this thing called Alan toen which is a nitrogen rich degradation product and we think it's maybe a keystone of that Community because it looks like of all the transcripts so again those are the MRNA that are going to turn into proteins that were the most highly transcribed in this whole 8 000 year old sediment like 50 meters down into the seafloor the second most the number one most transcribed Gene which if you've worked with transcriptomes you could probably guess what the number one was transcribed Gene was hypothetical it's always hypothetical it's like those things are like the most important genes in the whole ecosystem and we have no  clue what they are so the second thing that was most transcribed was actually a sharing Gene so this is a starving environment where they don't have much to eat and the second most highly transcribed Gene was actually a transporter that's used in centrifies to share your food with others which is very touching um but it but it also um you know basically feeds into one of my sort of ongoing theories that these extreme apocalyptic ecosystems are not dog eat dog at all because it doesn't make sense to compete when things are so limited um they actually cooperate I think quite a bit um this is another um little piece of evidence that we have some adaptation to this environment is work that came from um one of my another one of my PhD students Katie Sipes who is so absolutely addicted to going to the Arctic after going she can't stay up it's so funny she keeps finding more projects and I'm like Katie where are you and she's like Greenland so what she found in Siberia this is this beautiful Kalama River this is some of the oldest permafrost on Earth so this has been continuously Frozen for a million years which is crazy um she found this group which I was telling some folks at dinner about this profundalis group is um uh only ever found in Marine environments and she found it in this freshwater um place and a lot of these um Clays that she found in this deep weird old permafrost are very similar to what we find in these other subsurface environments so it really seems like there's something going on and the last sort of adaptational story I'll tell is from another one of my former students Joy Bongiorno who looked at these transcriptional differences she has this amazing data set which actually we're still analyzing um but depth is here this is now centimeters so this is like over that much space it's not super deep but what she looked at was the total amount of transcription of each of these genes as as you go with depth and this is the amount of transcription on the y axis and you can see it's in log here so this is quite a huge increase so she found this very big ramping up of this transcription of this one gene which ended up just being a gene to basically turn it into a Spore it was like a sort of like a strange type of sporulation so we think that these things we think that there are adaptations to being in the subsurface you know sporulating or repairing basically the we're not done I can't say that definitively but all of my research sort of points at the fact that these things are actually adapted to be where they are so now maybe I've convinced you that Earth does have a vibrant and varied subsurface biosphere that's supposed to be there it's not just waiting to get to the surface again it's it means to be there so what can how can we use this how can we use this to look for life on Europa um so I think of the subsurface as being divided up into two main categories one is subsurface life that gets its chemicals from inside Earth so it's basically got its own lunch with it and it's you know making its own biomass so chemosynthesis that's making biomass from chemicals and then the second type would be those that are dependent on photosynthesis which um you know are sort of like uh dependent on the surface world to give them food and to feed them and um the second one maybe I mean it's like doesn't seem as exciting right if we're talking about subsurface life you kind of want it to have its own thing and like just waiting for for stuff to trickle down from the surface seems like sort of cheating or maybe not what we're going for here but I wanna I wanna argue that this second group is actually useful for astrobiology we can still work on these places on Earth that are dependent on the surface and learn some stuff from it and I also forgot to say since it's the evening and we have a lot of different area of expertise if I if you want to ask a question we're not going to ask too many questions it's for technical reasons that you guys can't ask a lot of questions right now because there's a microphone but if if you're lost just raise your hand and be like what is can you explain this one thing Okay so one useless raster biology do we not want to study places like Marine sediments because it's you know dependent on having Amazon's up at the top um no I think it's useful um because we can get to them which I mean I know that's not the best reason to study something but it is important like getting a sample is very important and the cool thing about Marine sediments is that they're layered so if you want to run an experiment for a million years and I want to run an experiment from like I cannot tell you how badly I want to run an experiment for a million years but obviously I cannot but Marine sediments have already done it and so if you can be creative about how you sample them you can test hypotheses that have been run for a million years already that's why they're they're magical to me um so I want to tell you about the kind of life we find in them by talking about this first Great Expedition that we had off the coast of Peru with the ocean drilling program it was not the integrated ocean Discovery program back then it was ODP and it was the first sort of aseptic samples that we got from the deep subsurface and I'll show you what we got um with the simplistic not naming the microbes but I'll show them with boxes um so the dark blue boxes will be a strain of microbe that somebody else discovered and the gradient to White will tell you how far away it is from something somebody's discovered so like the novelty of it if it's totally novel totally new phylum that's never been discovered before it'll be a white box and then shades of blue in between so what we caught with DNA sequences was a bunch of kind of light colored boxes this stuff was really new it was very much unlike anything we'd ever seen before this is what I did um probably almost exactly at where most of you guys are in your careers right now I was pulling these sequences out and using far less sophisticated bioinformatics at the time to figure out how closely related they were but it was we we didn't know we didn't know about this uncultured dominance of life like you guys do now we were finding it we were like what the hell is this stuff I don't know so obviously the first time you go to a place like this you want to start culturing stuff and and this is low hanging fruit it's full of new stuff we should be able to grow it um so I'll show you the results of the growth experiments and every time they got one of these guys I'll show you um the new one underneath it and then any extra ones I'll show you off to the side so this is these are the ones of these that they caught when they cultured do you see any overlap do you see any white boxes got the same thing that people always get and this is not to say that we shouldn't culture I really I really don't want to send that message at all that is the wrong message and there's a lot of novelty even in here just getting something that looks like something we've seen before out of the deep ocean is absolutely worthwhile but we were not catching these guys and there actually was another group that did this too and they got pretty much the same thing so this this really hit home to me and is is one reason why I I really stick to this biomolecule stuff um we often call this stuff have you guys I'm sure you've heard this term microbial this is controversial does anybody hate that term no good accepting maybe the astronomers don't like it yeah I I actually like this term because um uh what it's it signifies just how pervasive this stuff is it's just kind of like oh it's not like oh we found a new thing it's like this is the main thing and we don't know what it is but yeah in terms of total mass it is far far less than astronomical dark matter um so since then we did a study where we went through and pulled out Gene sequences from the subsurface and asked the same question for all of them like if we divide up like how many of the sequences that we find are closely related to a culture versus something else new entirely and then we sort of put them in categories we find that this biggest pie wedge from terrestrial subsurface metagenomes is novel generetic class and then we get almost more than a third a novel phyla so they're really dominant in these environments that's the bacteria and that's the archaea um so it's not just it's not just that they're there and they're dominating diversity they're actually dominating the total biomass in these subsequences they're totally new stuff um and I my other soapbox about this is that even you know you can look at this little yellow pie wedge so this is a cultured organism this is done you can the things that fall into this pie wedge are things that you can order from a company and grow in your lab um however even these ones are probably going to act differently when we study them in the subsurface than when they grow in our Labs I mean if you if you were like a lion researcher which would be awesome but if you studied Lions only in a zoo then you wouldn't you would be like lions their whole deal is that they eat little pre packaged things of meat and cellophane and that would be your conclusion I mean that's stupid right we know they hunt and they kill live things out in nature but this is kind of like studying microbes in a zoo so even for the for the cultured guys we still need to go out into nature and we still need to sample them where they are and see try to figure out how they live so apbox number I don't know what number I'm on now many if you take microbiology 101 which I now teach we call it 220 actually um but you know like your your basic microbiology class microbes grow in cultures that's how we learn about microbes and we know a lot about like what microbes do on this planet these are like basic truths I'm not saying they're not true but I'm saying this is a frame of reference I want all of you to not think of these things as necessarily true just life could be different than what we think and it could be that there are microbes that are never going to grow in culture and are not going to act like anything that we've seen before and we need to not limit ourselves especially as astrobiologists you know we can't think small minded about this stuff because we'll miss something really important um so um so how how fast do these things grow in each sentiments that's that's this is part of the taking the lid off and seeing your frame of your implicit frame of reference that you may not have even realized you have um is when we think of microbes maybe we think fast because pathogens grow fast right you get sick pretty quickly um E coli for instance which we've all worked with certainly has a doubling time of 30 minutes it's not even the fastest micro but it's pretty fast but if you because we can work in Marine settlements we can do time scales because we have these layers so we can actually measure the doubling time so if you look at sediments with these ages ranging from 100 years down to 5 000 years and you put the generation time in years now that was 30 minutes this is years and at the surface in 100 year old sediments it's still 0.1 year so this is like still very very slow compared to E coli but if you go down even further we get up to the tens of years and maybe 100 years generation time um which you know we publish papers with these numbers in them all the time and we throw throw them around all the time but it's hard to wrap your brain around what it's like for a cell to actually live for that long um because this is a generation time this isn't necessarily dividing this could be just replacing itself like a turnover total carbon turnover for these cells so um so you know the number of cumulative Generations doesn't really increase at some point so what we have are a bunch of organisms that seem to just be hanging out for how how long can an individual live does somebody want to Venture I guess one one I don't know nematode tardigrade does anybody have a feel like what do you think of when you think of a lifespan it's the longest lived thing you guys are all astrobiologists you'll be like forever yeah thousands yeah yeah I mean even saying like thousands or five thousand years for a lifespan for one thing is already like utre right that is really long like we have um Sequoias are what 300 Bristlecone Pines or maybe a thousand do you have a thought Aspens how long do Aspens live 10 million how about does that but but even in right and so those guys so it's like clonal right and then even like the Sequoia that's not clonal it still has that living tissue and the living tissue certainly like those cells a living cell doesn't last as long as the whole tree so yeah we've got things that what I'm saying are lasting for a hundred thousand years one cell one like little precious tiny little lipid sack is hanging out intact for a hundred thousand years and I'm gonna venture to say also a million because why not and and I don't I don't know man like it's crazy but they might extra evidence for this because it's crazy Biz if you add up a total power so remember back to physics power is energy over time it's the flow rate of how much energy you can feed something because you can have a very nice Quantum of energy like you can a pizza will be just fine for me for a day but a pizza is not going to last me for my lifetime I'll die so the delivery rate of your food really matters so if you add up the total power per cell because we know pretty much how many cells there are out in in Marine sediments um this right here is the lowest measured power per cell that somebody has measured in a non growing chemostat have you heard of retento stats I really love retento stats but people don't work in them a chemostat is a sort of a normal thing to do where you're passing fluids through a population and you have them grow at a certain rate and you're constantly feeding them and growing them a retentostat just has a filter at the end so you're not nothing is leaving so they're not regrowing so you just keep them there so in a retentive stat they get down to this extremely extraordinarily low power but then if you look if you integrate the total power available from sulfate reduction and from methanogenesis all underneath the world's oceans it is orders of magnitude less than what it takes to just keep a cell going not growing growing is like way out here growing is not even on this chart this is just like existing so it's weird man it's real weird and and this is the reason I'm emphasizing this to you guys is that this means that there's basically a lot more energetic space for life in this universe than we think about in our daily lives we can we can imagine more for where life exists than you know just you know my dog and cat my kids and stuff um so um what we've learned from Marine sediments is that life in the subsurface may be fundamentally mentally different than what we've studied before and we can survive on much less power than we experience in the sub in the surface world and this Hundred Year lifespan thing which we're kind of intrinsically stuck within our brains is an assumption it's not a requirement um Okay so I want to switch gears how far on this I'm 37 minutes into this well no it's not quite 37 minutes I guess the bar is closed I can't tell you guys to get a drink does anybody need I'm gonna drink does anybody have a question before I go to the second section of this yeah cool like what's going on with like why they're but they photosynthesize oh that's a good one so for those of you who didn't hear that because the microphone wasn't there oh sorry why are there so many chloroflexy there are they adapted to the subsurface because they are photosynthesizers or at least phototrophic they are not all phototrophic is a Genus within there's a lot but um the halogen nators I guess you could call them so um that's where a lot of the chloroflexi research has been done just because that's funded because it's bioremediation because we use chlorinated compounds to clean planes and stuff um so those are fascinating organisms in and of themselves but most of the chlorophy that we find are in our linear I don't know if you know that group it's not well cultured um we don't have any phototrophic genes in them but yeah there's a lot but I it's cool that you bring up the chloroflexy because they are one of the most mysterious phyla do you work on chloroflexy um I'm working uh steam vents and like I'm in uh Jimmy's laws group so we do a lot of thermophiles and stuff um yeah yeah um so chlorofloxacy keep popping up and there's a lot of them and I just keep looking at my genomes and I'm like yeah so the study that we did where we Quantified the uncultured things all around the world of all the we looked at all environments it the only clade that showed up in the most uncultured that showed up as sorry as one of the most abundant clades in every environment you know animal guts engineered places human guts snow everything was annaolini it's that chlorophy group like everything else like shifts and you have some things in some places but annerolini I don't know if that's how you pronounce it they're everywhere they drive me nuts I don't know what they do um this microphone javelin's a bad idea um do you think it's just the the doubling time or is it nutrients and potentially like physical structure that's a problem for culturing microbes in the sediments oh why don't we get cultures um I wish I knew that I think it's all those things I mean it's like if you think about what culturing is it's Limitless access to Abundant substrate which is a problem if you don't have like running your metabolism really hot is actually dangerous for a cell and those of us who run at a very high level like have all kinds of reactive oxygen species defenses and things like that but if you're not set up to go fast then being forced to go fast can kill you so that's one thing too much too much food you need your friends you need your enemies you need vitamins you need minerals that you're lacking you need them in the right crystalline structure pressure um I don't know if it's self congratulatory to talk about my TED talk but I gave this Ted talk about whatever it happened I um I gave this Ted talk about culturing things in the deep sea and I get an email like probably it's slowed down now but it was like hot and heavy when the first thing came out thing first came out somebody being like have you considered pressure [Music] yes I've considered pressure it's like I forgot to mention it in the talk but um people are thinking it's good there's a lot there's a lot of reasons why things are not on culture but I I think there's a lot to learn from that uh hypothetical I think I guess philosophical question do you think a cell could possibly never die or is it possible that the lifespan could just be essentially infinite we have a we have a limiter on that and it's 4.5 billion years but that's it I mean but that's a huge I mean that's a lot to play with and then if you if you invoke panspermia which I don't know if you know this theory that life formed outside of which I wanted to switch to pan ovia but then I don't know whatever pan pan movie of um of life then you know you could have a living cell that was like when the Milwaukee and period on Mars was you probably know better than me like five billion years ago six anyway Mars is older than Earth so that may be our limiter I don't know but that's crazy not that crazy so you mentioned about um the abundance of centrify in the Deep subsurface communities um do you think um are there any like interesting patterns in the distribution of like microbes that are typically associated with like centrify or yeah um or is it always just nutrient limitation you mean like physically where cells sit really to each other do they sit together layers yeah like do we see more Center fees in some areas and then others um I don't I don't think we have that kind of knowledge like that resolution like you could maybe do that project but I don't think we have that like just concluding centrify from like the transcription of some genes is already kind of sketch so but you could push it farther for sure okay hi I really like your talk so far uh so I I haven't done research in the Deep subsurface as well and so you had a slide that showed the different adaptations for the subsurface microbes and I think you mentioned that you had transcriptomic data genomic data yeah metabolomic data so it's a lot of data um and I only work with um genomic data and already I'm so overwhelmed by the different things that I can analyze so I was just curious I mean I could read the paper but you're here now um how do you how do you how do you find the adaptations in this mess of data yeah and how does it compare so you mentioned DNA repair mechanisms and all of this like how does that compare to the terrestrial counterparts yeah that's those are really good questions I mean I think this is something that we all face there's like in every project and I've seen it happen to all my students you work so hard to get that giant data set and then you get it and you're like what do I do with this fire of information and it's not like how you analyze it there's no prescribed path through it which I think is a wonderful thing because it means somebody could take your same data set and draw completely different conclusions from it but in the case of the stuff I was talking about we started with our smallest data set and our most valuable so we did metabolites which if you haven't worked with these this is like you do liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry coupled to another Mass spectrometry to sort of spread things out and get monomers so you can basically get things at the amino as like monomeric amino acid level and you kind of get what you you get and so I I only did it because my buddy does this like down the hall and he was like let me put some of your weird samples in the machine and I was like that's insane because you're just going to get the organic matter that's around like the stuff is not necessarily connected to the living microbes and he's like let's just try it and he was like it totally failed it didn't work and I was like well yeah nothing ever works in the subsurface it doesn't surprise me but he was like I only got 20 metabolites and I was like 20s a lot so we took our 20 and just backed off of them we said okay we've got nicotinate and I I was like what in the world is like I Googled it I was like what is this and what is it used for and it's like oh it's a precursor to NAD and then we also had quinlanate it's like never heard of that organ of that that compound before and it's also an intermediate in the pathway for the creation of NAD and so then because we had the transcripts we were able to say who is producing the biosynthetic pathways for these molecules that we see and so that was a nice way to do a data reduction those may not be the most important stories in those ecosystems in fact they probably are not right like we probably missed the biggest story that's there but that was just the one we found I don't know if that's helpful that's super helpful metabolomics are great they can be great they can be confusing too but but it's also like when you're dealing with a gigantic data set like I guess just don't worry about getting the perfect story like if you can find that it says something like run with it and publish it so we can know about it too thank you um hi thank you for your talk I you talk about these cells that live for hundreds of thousands of years or like millions of years or billions of years but maybe philosophically speaking what do you consider to be an individual like when all the bioplasts kind of re like you know like we regenerate or whatever recycles thank you is it the same um is that still the same individual like how do you work around that yeah I don't know I mean I guess that is a truly philosophical question there's like the philosophical point about like my grandfather's ax do you know about my grandfather's acts there's something in like this is my grandfather's ax it's you know he had it and it's like well the I replaced the blade a little while ago well I replaced the handle a little while ago I replace the like the leather strapping on it it's like okay no molecule of that ax was ever held by your grandfather but it's my grandfather's ax so then that that's a purely philosophical question but I think there's a second philosophical question which I find interesting which is what is an individual which is what you said first which is like when we talk about microbes we tend to talk about the individual as a collection of cells we talk about a strain you know we don't talk about a cell like an individual cell is pointless in in real normal microbiology because they're constantly regenerating and we have cell lines and stuff but in this environment where you can't have a cell line suddenly the individual takes on great importance this is almost akin to like our lives like we care about an individual dying and we don't care about a cell of a microbe dying ever makes research a lot easier should I continue okay if you're bored take a nap it's warm in here I gave a talk once on a ship and everybody fell asleep it actually happened it was nice they looked very comfortable so I just kept talking so now that we know that we've got all this weird stuff down there um how you know how can you sustain a subsurface biosphere we know that there aren't a bunch of plants at the surface of these other planetary bodies but can we work on this planet where we are blessed with all these wonderful plants up here and find things that are independent of that dominant signal and so one this isn't the only way to go about this hopefully you're a room full of people who will find other ways to answer this question too but um one way that my colleagues and I thought of doing this is to go to a subduction zone which are fascinating geological places because in a case of an ocean Continental subduction zone you have an oceanic tectonic plate that basically just gets shoved very slowly into a continental tectonic plate an oceanic plate is just denser than continental plate so it sinks and it goes down and this is one of the major ways that we get recycling between the deep Earth and the surface Earth but what also happens is that you get this build up this bunching up in the forearch so this is the ocean plate going down that pushes water out of all these areas and if you draw this 150 degrees C isotherm which is kind of the limit of Life although I definitely won't say that because it could be much higher but currently you know we think that it life has to be under this value there's actually a lot of real estate in here that's probably getting fleshed out passively by these hot springs and um so we thought you know it'd be nice to drill 10 million dollar boreholes all the way across this entire thing but there is literally no one who will ever fund me to do that and also I don't want to get a permit to drill holes all over Costa Rica so we use these Hot Springs as like passive sampling ports and um this is uh the most interdisciplinary collaborative group of people that I possibly work with and this is not everybody who's involved but I just want to thank them up front originally these are my lab crew TJ Rogers is going to turn in his dissertation in a week and a half he is texting me constantly he's doing great he's gonna pull through um and then Joy's finished up and and Kate did her Masters and she did wonderful work on this and then we had all these International collaborators from all over the place some of whom y'all probably know including lots of people in Costa Rica because that is where science has to come from when you're doing work on you know I started out in oceanography and you just go to oceans and drop things in them because it's all big oceans but when you're working on land you do not go in a country that is not your country and take samples which I'm sure you all know but um it's not just is it morally wrong but you miss the local knowledge you miss the understanding of what's actually happening there so this is driven largely by my colleagues in Costa Rica so we sampled this is pretty much the whole country of Costa Rica so you can see we covered some pretty good ground this is their line of volcanoes volcanoes pop up because this down going plate basically runs into mantle and all the water that on this down going plate exaltvates the mantle and makes it sort of have this runaway liquidification that shows up in volcanoes and our d our idea was to sample all these red dots or hot springs and see if we could get a difference in the progression of the subsurface biosphere is it moves from early subduction into the volcanoes and late subduction and just to show you what some of the sites looked like this is cabrato Spanish speakers I apologize I'm trying to learn a language and I'm really bad at it but there was all this uh iron uh oxidate uh iron ferry hydroxides that were produced from these subsurface microbes so we're sampling gases there's gases bubbling out of here but it's at the edge of a river so we're fighting the surface stuff all the time some of the samples look like this boiling mud pots so this is looking quite inhospitable for science whatever I don't have to point to that it's in the picture um and some of them were in the middle of volcanoes so this is pois volcano which is um this Caldera you can tell that it erupts a lot obviously because okay you see Department there are trees right I don't have to laser point to it oh I can point like this all around this this Central so this right here this eye of it is basically the throat of the volcano this is the part where um the eruptions start um and you can see that it erupts a lot because the plants would love to use all this good iron um but they can't because every time they get in there they get blown up um so this is me sampling next to this Lake I am so this is Donato he's reading the numbers out to me and it was 0.85 pH this is very very acidic um basically sulfuric acid then you can see the fumes this is a very uncomfortable picture the ground is um 100 degrees Celsius and it's really like bad Rock so if you slip you fall into a battery acid lake so but the most dangerous things about volcanoes is about 54 56 days after we were in it um this happened so that you can see the shore where I was it was like right there and you can look as it continues erupting it's not like it just blows up once you can see this stuff kind of shooting out here again you should be able to see it and it's like if that happened while you were there there's some more if that happened while you're there it's like you would go up and down then you go up again then you get a bunch of rocks on your head it would be very bad um my colleague one of my colleagues um one of my worst decision making colleagues send us videos from that Creator the day before this and it was like the ground was like popping in front of him oh he's not I got other colleagues who are a little more he's I worry about I worry about that guy um but you know it's fun to go in these dangerous places but we also have to mitigate our danger I don't know I I've got kids I don't I don't do this stuff if it had been nasty like that I would not have gone in any time around this area um I just went in because it was such a calm time but um fieldwork does doesn't involve some risks so um the way we think about the subsurface when we get these semi dangerous samples is we don't know how deep we're getting them from we are going we are driving all over this country and we were sampling tons and tons of Hot Springs they're in people's backyards it's the coolest thing we like walk up to people we're like hey and they recognize my colleagues from TV because they talk about volcanoes a lot and we're like can we sample your hot springs they're like absolutely so we um uh we sample this stuff and we don't know how deep it's coming from so one of the things we want to know is how do we blank out all this crap beautiful crap that we depend on but we don't want to study so all of the dissolved organic carbon has a carbon isotope I'm not going to explain what they are some of you know intimately about carbon Isotopes and the other two thirds of you are like I don't know what this is but that's okay just know that this value ranges everything up here at the surface ranges from minus 23 to minus 30. and our inorganic carbon so this is carbon dioxide is like zero ish and this should be the similar in all Springs so when we measure these things the DIC which at the for atmosphere should be sort of around hereish it got quite negative it got quite light and it had this pattern with its concentration and that was sort of intriguing to us and so my colleagues who are gastiochemists looked at this and they said oh my God this is a Rayleigh distillation this is what happens with Isotopes f is the reaction extent so this is like how far the reaction has progressed is you have the reaction happening in an open system so that the Isotopes can be removed and there's a fractionation of of the Isotopes as as this progresses you get this extreme push of the fraction of the Del C 13 of the values and so they modeled this stuff and found that actually this was a Rayleigh fractionation um that uh differed between early and subduction closer to the volcanoes and in the volcanoes and these are the volcanic gases themselves so the offset between this end member and the volcanic gases was basically showed that this stuff was entirely um from from Deep gases this was not carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at all um so I don't know if you have ever done this with your data sets you might call it P hacking but I don't want to call it that we don't do that in jail I don't I swear that's like just the medical thing I think we shouldn't limit ourselves does anybody see two little rainbows right there do you see two like I got this data set and I was like I swear there's two of them and I was like but I shouldn't do that because that's reading too much into my data but I stared at it for long enough and I finally figured out what was driving those two if you divide them and you say okay this one's on the top curve and I'm making it blue and that one's on the bottom curve and I'm making it orange and I tried to figure out are they different temperatures were they different ph's none of it nothing was making sense and then I put them on a map and they fall down a line and I was giving this talk the Carnegie Institute in DC before we published this paper and I said yeah and we have no idea for some reason everything up there is on the upper line and everything down here is on the lower line but it's real because it's not randomly distributed and I don't know maybe there's something out here in this geophysicist like ran up to me after the talk and who is like there's a plate boundary that divides those two samples and he just knew because he knew the plates really well and so this is the East Pacific Rise and the Coco's Nazca spreading Center originating things so basically this me this means that the stuff we're getting coming out of these Hot Springs like literally next to two cans and monkeys like driving around like sipping pina colada coladas all over Costa Rica is so connected to this stuff that is subducting offshore that we can see the isotopic difference in the carbon that's coming in from these down going slabs which is gives us great power to say that yeah this stuff is deep subsurface this is actually connected to this stuff um so so now how do we use this power we know all this carbon this inorganic carbon which is the starting point for chemosynthesis we know all this stuff is coming from the deep Earth how do we show that that microbes are turning it into to life or are they just using the the plants and cow poop and stuff like that so now if we put in the organic matter and put it on the same plot the Del C 13 of the organic matter we see it follows along this same line and it's always offset from what the inorganic carbon were and the value of that offset is roughly the fractionation that we would expect to see if it was all being made by chemosynthesizers in situ and so for this reason we were able to conclude that all you can never say all pretty much everything that's living there seems to be made from the chemicals that are there from the deep Earth so this is a despite all the jungles despite this huge surface signal we're getting something that's truly in the subsurface and it's only from there and we have a positive control because it's nice to have those um can we control for Jungle Farm surface world and yes we can we scooped up sediments where we were across the Ark in the same places and there the carbon is photosynthetic so we can see the photosynthetic stuff there um so um so basically the the sort of point in going through all this isotopic stuff is to say that this subsurface of the subduction zone is dominated by chemosynthesis of chemicals so this is something that could be happening on another planet that has no photosynthesis at all um and now we're at 60 minutes and I have meta genomes to talk about but welcome do you guys want to do you know what a metagenome is wait raise your hand if you know what a metagenome is oh my God it's so many people it's beautiful is that like does it make you want to cry thinking about yeah yeah there's a lot of pain for those of you who didn't raise your hands metagenomes are all the DNA in a sample like all of it just sequence it um so what you get is this like garbled mess of every Gene from every organism doing God knows what and so one thing we do with them is that we can knit them back together through the magic of bioinformatics and I'm not going to tell you how but I will if you want to know not right now nobody wants to hear that but I did not think this could be done at all but now it can and it can be done so well that I actually use it and what this does is it gives you genomes basically you can get like a whole genome and say what a thing can be doing so my student TJ caught 403 of these things that were pretty complete and so now think about what you do all right you've got like 20 samples across Costa Rica you know they're something special they're not a bunch of cow poop so now you have 400 mags and you can figure out their distribution because you can recruit those reads I know some of y'all know what that means but basically you can see the prevalence of each of those mags all these data sets how do you visualize that data how do you deal that fire hose you know like so anyway what we thought of to do which may not be the only thing is to make a heat map I love making heat Maps just show you like what the color of it shows you how much of it is there and this is what part of it looks like this is a third of this heat map and what this is is each column running vertically here is a hot spring and every row is a microbe and so if it's yellow here then that microbe was present in that hot spring so look at that big black part right there this is a whole slew of hot springs that did not have those microbes present at all and so we we organized it I mean we this isn't just randomly distributed we said put things together that have more similar distributions and what we were really surprised to see is that it came out to be so completely organized so this just happens to be all of the volcanic samples came out here and then all of these um sort of like Technicolor things over here are there different metabolisms so this is just like a ridiculously complex data set visualized as best as we can so you can kind of see what they're breathing and I know you can't really see but this is their respiration and whether they fix carbon whether they're chemo the autotrophs or not and then this is the same heat map just cut and moved up there so this is not a separate run now all these ones that were black over here are now yellow because these are these set of microbes are the ones that are present only in the early subduction so things filtered out really really distinctly and then we had a third group of things that were just kind of everywhere and so when we looked at what these things were we wanted to see are these the cumulus are these the ones that are making the energy for everybody else yes they were we found that about 30 percent of the community could do carbon fixation both in this this is just the same heat map just cut up into pieces both in the volcanoes and at the beach and then less of them were distributed everywhere and these ones used this oxic carbon fixation pathway everywhere so we're starting the side eye the ones that are everywhere as you should be as well um but what is it that distinguished them between these different places um so can you see it's another test if you look at the color things the color strips do you see differences does the left hand color strip look like different colors than the middle color strip to you and the right hand color strip you can kind of see them I kind of this is one reason why I like looking at complex data out like this because you can really see patterns like for instance this green line here doesn't really it's not as complete over here it's like more of a going concern here and there's more of this purple stuff here than there is over here so what this all boils down to if you stare at it for months and months is that this volcano stuff liked a little bit of oxygen they did a lot of sulfur oxidation and they did nitrate reduction the things out at the coast were totally different they were breathing totally different things they were doing sulfate reduction and hydrogen oxidation and these guys that were everywhere were aerobic and sulfur oxidizers and they basically depended on oxygen so what we concluded from this is that these are the microbial communities that show up late in subduction because there's a lot of hydrothermal alteration of their Waters that add sulfur so they have a ton of CO2 there's very little calcite precipitation and they get lots of oxidized substrates because they have a shallow geothermal gradient that sucks in oxygen these guys were early in subduction they didn't have a lot of hydrothermal alteration but they had lots of reduced sulfur compounds so they were very carbon dioxide limited but they still did chemo they still managed to like fix the carbon and make the ecosystem go but it was fundamentally different than what we saw at the volcanoes and then I don't know does anybody have any theories for what's going on with these guys who show up literally everywhere primary producers maybe oh like a photosynthetic primary producers if that's what you're implying then yes because [Laughter] these are the this is the crap this is the soil stuff this is the surface World um the identities of these microbes are like common soil things and they liked oxygen and so and they showed up everywhere they didn't really care where they were in subduction um so what this means is that the redox couples that fuel this chemo chemosynthetic primary production are distributed they're everywhere so if we're going to go looking somewhere else for this subsurface Community um it's likely to be there as long as we have some sort of energy we're likely to find it conclusion slide subsurface life is different than surface life it seems simplistic but we know it for for sure they can survive on extort this is an understatement very little power and very long time skills um and at least on Earth we got a whole world down there that is doing its own thing and it does not need the Sun and they're large enough to really leave a mark on the subsurface landscape they are precipitating calcite they're leaving iron Ferry hydroxides we can see them so I will end with a question for y'all and I use y'all advisedly I'm from North Carolina I live in Tennessee I'm moving to California but um don't give up on the south seriously I know it's easy to vilify the South we are gerrymandered all to hell so we are a fantastic place and we have very oppressed people and um we deserve your attention um so question for y'all if we have this robust of a chemo litho autotrophic this chemosynthetic subsurface Community here on this place where we have this dominant signal what will it be like on a planetary body that doesn't have all that stuff at the surface it will it be different will it be the same and how do we look for it and I got to thank the funders and I have a pretty place to work for the next year and I'll take more questions if you want or you can do that in that thing foreign I was wondering how different the mineralogy was because you I knew you had a section that had these hydrogen supported and I'm assuming that it was geologic hydrogen from the serpentization like how different was the mineralogy like could you tell the difference and what led to in terms of like the type of enzymes that they were able to have in their like biology based on the metals that were around like was that some kind of connection that you could make or I don't know I just want more collaboration I'm sorry yeah I want more elaboration on the minerals too um Shauna Morrison did all the mineralogy for this and she found pyrite framboids in the it's very altered hydrothermal so that's feeding into our hypothesis of why there's so much iron and sulfur cycling in the volcanoes but picking apart how the metals influence and you know the crystalline form of the metals influence all these communities is a bit of a fine scale thing and so I think that's going to be more apparent in our global data set is this because this project has metastasized [Music] so my question is coming from very limited background in biology so yeah so when you talk about lifespan uh why do different organisms have different lifespans like different species have different lifespans do we know this why do different species have different lifespans yeah [Laughter] somebody want to answer that Kelly do you want to yell down for us yeah yeah it's Kelly tell us that looks good um so you have this group that is kind of like surface derived that that you say is everywhere and is likely eating so the communities in the subsurface so on I don't think they're feeding the rest of the communities no I think they're just really angry to have been washed into a hot spring yeah there I I don't want to use the word contamination because that kind of means that implies something from our bodies or like our coughs um it's more like just not the things we were looking for because you you know hot spring is coming up through layers of rock and so there's gonna be some soil stuff washed in yeah I don't they could be or did you have a thought I mean they could be feeding them no no I understand I think the chemo synthesizers are I mean they're basically taking carbon that's coming from that slab so that's carbon that got buried in the Pacific Ocean 10 million years ago and it gets buried and gets volatilized however it gets from high pressure and temperature and then comes back up and that's that's what's forming their bodies clear thank you for your talk I was wondering um so you talk a lot about the unculturable that's what you work on actually never say that word okay let's get in trouble when I do so a lot of these organisms or most of them are uncultured uncultured yeah um so what are your thoughts on you are annotating a lot of this stuff from stuff that is also uncultured do you think there is a it just like that hypothetical protein sort of idea where this is most related to this which is most related to this how do you think um you can sort of circumvent that potential issue you mean the issue of the game of telephone where you think something's a one thing and it's actually not right um I think that we have to be really careful about what we conclude like if you're at least in my research like if I if my story really depends on a particular annotation then I go hard into that annotation and make a multiple species alignment of the multiple sequence alignment of that Gene and show that there's more evidence for it being what I think it is than just like proka annotates it as X um and you can look you know you can look for the P fans you can look for the active site you can do all sorts of things to sort of prove to yourself you can look for the flanking genes the gene syntony all these things you can use to build up a case you're not going to do that for a whole genome or much less 400 genomes but you can do that for the thing that you want to talk about um but I mean I just think that like there's so much to be gained in that hypothetical space and sorry another soapbox about this is that you know cool we free ourselves from cultures we're free what's the first thing we do when we get this genome say how similar is it to a culture so we're not free um great talk I should preface this by saying that I'm an astronomer so I did my best well the last one just stumped me so foreign Mars and Europa and Enceladus and those icy moons have a very different environmental conditions than the earth um and it seemed like a lot of this was predicated on subduction yeah and not some sort of subscribe for instance yeah so yeah I just wonder how how you develop a subsurface um biological World in a static lit environment or in a subsurface ocean environment I'm writing an EXO Grant about that right now actually but but I mean not that I know the answer to it but I mean that is that is basically like the Fatal flaw of my entire or my second half of my talk it but it's a relevant one because there's no plate tectonics in our solar system except on Earth in the entire history you know the fact that Olympus Mons is so enormous is simply because at hot spot's been sitting there like for however long it's been sitting there so I think that the grant that I'm writing right now is you know we may not get it is to basically try to get out of subduction zones and do our same style of sampling in our same style of work around hot spots here on Earth or at least plume influenced environments but you can't get away from plate tectonics on Earth just the same way you can't get away from the photosynthes so um we're going to have to deal with Hawaii so are you suggesting there's no life elsewhere with that I love that yeah I think the answer to that is going to be fascinating I guess this is this is kind of to uh so is is there something like why do we have plate tectonics sorry this is something this is almost the song no that's the question is a great question I don't know why do do people know that I feel like people know that why do we have flight tectonics I don't know it maybe has something to do with our size you know our size and relative heat I mean because it's all heat convection that's driving it so you need the right brittleness versus Heat to break it apart and move them but that may not be the right answer I don't know I would say I'm a microbiologist but I don't have any degrees in that did you I think you raise your hand you raise your hand first person is this on whoa all right let's see if this makes sense so hi I'm Emily I study the limits of life in Saline environments and there's some research on like thermodynamic limits to certain metabolisms including um autotrophy that's not driven by oxygenic things and so I was wondering given that you found a lot of chemo autotrophs in the Deep subsurface that are in incredibly energy limited environments do you think there actually is a limit to life or is this like yeah I don't know you mean an energetic limit yeah sure like you know in a in an extreme environment you have to like use a lot of energy to like survive there right so yeah even places where you get your protons for free like an acidic environment you still spend a lot of energy baling yeah is there a limit for life yes yeah there has to be like a Gibbs free energy of zero is equilibrium and you can't have life with equilibrium there has to be a gradient but the but the interesting question is where is that line and that's what we don't know but there is it exists did you want to ask your question hi I'm also an astronomer and I wanted to kind of move even further out than Nick did um so something we think about a lot as astronomers is like habitable zone and like you know what temperature planets might have to be to host life but I'm wondering what your thoughts are about the prospects for life on like free floating planets that aren't associated with a star there are free floating planets that are not associated with stars yes seriously Kepler finder finding is a lot it's more of a microwave do we know about them from Kepler or what do we know about them even Hubble okay I have a lot of thoughts about this I'd be happy to talk about it sometimes that's crazy we've been how do they have I mean do they have their own heat Source internally or they I mean because you got to have some kind of gradient that's all you gotta have something like some heat from formation probably yeah fading over time or like some tidal forcing from somebody nearby or they just like totally lonely got nothing wow radio radiogenic Decay yeah yeah so I mean you gotta have something right there's got to be a gradient there's got to be if not redox just something um I don't know clearly I don't know the answer to that because I didn't know that they were there but you know we talk about the Habit like when you think of the habitable zone do you think about distance from the Star and brightness from the star of the star um also think about the depth of that planet because that'll really expand your Capital Zone quite a bit if you can go inside the planet it gets better we have temper one more question free floating plants hi um first off I'm also from North Carolina so hello where where are you from uh Raleigh I'm from Beaufort oh nice I was just curious um what do you think is the uh stability of these subsurface ecologies through both like geological time and like planetary scales and if there's any like way to like have like a fossilized record of their presence at all that we could detect yeah I mean the carbonates like the minerals that they leave behind the waste products are probably the best in microfossils of course and lipids are are good ways to look for these sorts of things but in terms of like the time span of this stuff you know we're just looking at the Modern stuff now and so I think that I don't know as much as I should about that but there's a lot to be done all right let's give one last round of applause for Karen [Applause] oh and just a few housekeeping things so uh tomorrow morning we'll have breakfast at the grad student lounge so those of you who didn't come it's a few doors down if you look at the FAQ we sent out all the information's in there if there's any questions that are not answered just message Miguel orai but that will start at 8 A.M and then we'll promptly start this talks right at nine great oh yeah and okay I just want to add one thing for those of you that checked in and got your awesome swag bag that's great but if you did not get the plastic NASA bag and you want one come see me at the check in desk before you go okay guys thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
