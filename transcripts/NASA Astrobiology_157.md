[Music] hi everyone um I'm Claire and so I'm going to talk a little bit about respiration oxygen sensing um and this idea that there might be a really close relative to the ancestor of Proto mitochondria in modern oxygen minimum zones um so I think a lot of people here are familiar with eukaryogenesis it's this idea that an archaea and a bacteria a very long time ago decided to be best friends forever and now we're here um so there's lots of different hypotheses over how this might have happened um and kind of the main point I want to make here is that one there's always a bacterial host and that's generally thought of as an alpha proteobacteria and there's also a lot of or has been a lot of talk historically about is this obligately aerobic does it have to have oxygen is it facultatively aerobic where it could use oxygen or not or is it kind of um an anaerobic partnership that turned into aerobic partnership so a lot of more quantitative Recent research so kind of this triangulation method suggests that this new clade of marine Alpha proteobacteria from marine oxiclines and these are really related to a group called iodidemonus This is an iodide using bacteria might be the closest living relative to protomitochondria um and so like I said Alpha proteobacteria for a while have been thought of as that sort of bacterial component of eukaryogenesis and what I'm going to showing you really quick right here is that these are some anaerobic traits that are thought of really essential when you're looking at the criteria for this ancestor and so most of these are alpha proteobacteria and when we're looking at the heat map what we want to focus on is this green highlighted here that's this new clade so they hit all of these criteria for anaerobic traits when we're thinking about this protomyochondria and then when we're thinking more about the aerobic side of this these facultative aerobics we want to think about the terminal electron chain so what's interesting is that this is comprised of four complexes and these complexes actually have this really phenomenal history of the evolution of respiration inside of it so from complex one to complex four we can kind of track as the Earth went from anoxic to the great oxidation event to kind of what we experience now and so I'm really looking more at complex four because um within it um this is that last step that important uh reduction step so if we're thinking about proto mitochondria they would need to have this complex for um so that can be divided up even more into this a to c family we have an a type lots of oxygen we don't have to bind it super well it's there but the sea family is thought of these as the oldest terminal or complex four of the terminal electron chain and that's because it's capable of binding oxygen at very very low levels so for this new clade I had two main questions looking at sort of data mining which is what kind of genes do they have for respiration is it um entirely aerobic or is there anaerobic as well are they able to sense oxygen and are they moving along gradients in response to that and then on top of that are these genes actually being transcribed um so I did a lot of data mining in the uh with this nice big data set from the sandwich Inlet that's in British Columbia it's a seasonally hypoxic area but it's an oxygen minimum Zone and that just means that very quickly we'll lose oxygen very high up in the water column and it's you can see how like seasonally variable it is but overall there's a pretty dramatic drop in oxygen and so the two really interesting points I saw was one there are c type aerobic oxidases associated with this Alpha Pro newclate Alpha proteobacteria and its transcription or the amount that it was being used potentially increased Into the anoxic Depths and that there are two chemotaxis proteins so that's an aerotaxis protein maybe maybe not it might be responding to something else um they were both being transcribed really highly into these anoxic depths um so my main takeaway is we should look at omz's more we're thinking about protomitochondria um because there are some really interesting Alphas there that only exist right now as metagenomic assembled genomes um and it would be really interesting to really look at the full genomic uh capabilities of them um so I'd like to thank the glass Lab at Georgia Tech um my funding the NSF grad and then the oceans across space and time team [Applause] [Music]
