what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind okay okay number of exoplanets out there uh so you know you look at the night sky on a clear night when you can see stars and you and you you your mind is already crumbling at the thought of how many stars are out there but the fact that we think that for at least every planet you see there's at least one exoplanet so for all the stars you're seeing there might be this just flood of exoplanets that you can't see is just not only is it cool I like I can't wrap my brain around it and every night I try to sit up at the sky and say they're out there and I just can't accept it because I can't see them so not only is it unbelievable it's also just hard to wrap your head around
