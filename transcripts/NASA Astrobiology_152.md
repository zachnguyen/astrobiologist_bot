[Music] hi everyone I'm Emily and I'm a PhD candidate in the DECA slab at Stanford University and I study the limits of life in hyper saline environments so as we all probably know Brian's are one of the targets for a life detection mission to other ocean worlds including Europa and Enceladus and even past ocean worlds like Mars and so by understanding the limits of salty life on Earth we can understand how and where to look for life on these other places one of the ways we can assess a brine environment is through this measurement called water activity and water activity depends on vapor pressure but you can think of it about as how many water molecules are available to a cell in solution so on the left is an image of what pure water would be this is where all the water molecules are free to become Vapor move about the cabin that would be a water activity of one now if there's ions in solution water would be attracted to those molecules and a water activity would decrease so the lower the water activity the more uninhabitable an environment is and since water is required for all Life as We Know It water activity can be used to assess assess habitability so some common items in their water activities are listed on the left including sea water which has a pretty high water activity and the salinity of seawater is about 3.5 percent and then honey has a water activity of 0.6 and some of Mars special regions or areas where we might detect life on Mars are in no lower than 0.5 and there's been a lot of really great pure culture work on the limits of life and cell division at different water activities and to sum it up the predicted or theoretical water activity limit for all life on Earth including eukaryotes and prokaryotes is about 0.6 and this is based on pure culture so like our speaker last night mentioned not all the things in the world are in pure culture yet so that leaves out about 90 or more of the biodiversity on Earth and our ability to assess what the limit of life for each of those strains of microbes are so brine environments are really widespread on Earth they're everywhere um and a lot of great work has gone into assessing metagenomics like the taxonomic diversity the potential metabolic metabolic potential of microbes in these environments metatranscriptomes and even some bulk activity measurements but metabolic activity is rarely measured at the Single Cell level and this can be really important because when a cell is stressed out they might have really low levels of activity that are not detected with both techniques so today I'll be talking a little bit about my work in solar cell turns and then transition into the my current work in Western Australia aesthetic brands so like I mentioned when life is reaching its limit a metabolic activity can be really low and so single cell analysis can help us detect the slow level of activity by lowering detection limits so a cell needs to acquire 50 new biomass to be able to divide into two new daughter cells however with Nano Sims for example we only need to detect about five percent maximum we can even get as low as less than one percent of new biomass to detect active life in a sample it also provides quantitative results so we can do a lot with this data on a quantitative level and it also reveals trends that are often obscured by bulk analysis and when I'm talking about metabolic activity in this talk I'm talking specifically about anabolic activity so there's catabolic activity that produces energy for a cell and then there's anabolic activity where a cell can take substrates from the environment like amino acids and glucose and take that carbon and nitrogen and then produce new cell biomass which includes proteins DNA and cell walls and that sort of thing so first the work that I've done at this um solar Salter and it's called South Bay saltworks it's in here in San Diego and basically they bring sea water in from San Diego Bay and it goes through a series of evapo concentration ponds and as the water evaporates out of the sea water different salts are left behind producing a series of ponds that range in water activity from 0.98 that of seawater to that well below the known limit of Life at 0.4 and so we measured anabolic activity of over 6 000 individual cells from a series of five of these brines with five different isotopic substrates from amino acids ammonium and bicarbonate glucose and nitrate and that sort of thing we measured their anabolic activity with nano SIM so on the left this is what this looks like cells that are circled in red are considered enriched and this is for carbon from amino acids and then the cells that are circled in white would be considered less active or less enriched in the sample and when you plot this with water activity you see that microbial activity decreases exponentially with water activity however there's certain areas so you can see certain subsets of cells are more active than most of the cells in seawater at a higher water activity with even just low decreases in water activity um we also detected cell biomass through dappy and nanosims in the slow water activity magnesium chloride brine however we didn't detect any activity here and the incubation time was two days long so there's several reasons for this um we were also able to use this data to estimate a new predicted lower limit of Life at 0.54 so that's a little significantly biologically significantly lower than the 0.6 previous limit detected sorry predicted and this data I'd love to talk more about it but it's been submitted and I just got word that it's now in review as of this morning so it's really exciting and if you'd like to hear more about that please talk to me later so now to kind of get into the topic of this talk which is I'm talking about the limits of life in acidic brine environments there's a lot of things that happen in brines so you can have salinity as a limiting factor you can have high metal concentrations you can have high ionic strength and chaotropicity but one thing that really stood out to me about this sample set was that most of the brines that had high levels of activity actually had a pH about seven or eight so like relatively neutral to slightly basic pH however this magnesium chloride brine which had no detectable activity had a pH of about 5.4 and so my question was how does pH affect microbial activity in brine environments and is this an important factor in the limits of life so last summer our team went to Western Australia to sample a bunch of acidic brines and these brines are considered Mars analogs because of the geochemistry and weathering systems that created them over millions of years um just in a short oxidation of sulfides acidified the water and then evaporation concentrated ions and other salts over time creating these really acidic Briny environments there's hundreds of these lakes and we were really lucky to sample a really broad spectrum of them so on the x axis is water activity and on the y axis is pH and I was really thrilled to get a nice group of lakes to sample for activity analysis especially these ones that are boxed these are were at a water activity at 0.7 and they range in PH so it's a really good opportunity to kind of look at how pH affects metabolism at low water activity so at this this study I analyzed metabolic activity specifically anabolic activity by incubating these brines with an analog amino acid called hpg cells that are active in the sample will take up hpg and incorporate them into their new proteins that are produced and then the hpg has a alkyne group on the end that later on in lab you can perform click chemistry on and click a 404 to it so all the cells that are active in the sample turn out green under the microscope or in flow cytometry and then that can be counter stained or compared to cells that are stained blue via DNA stain of doping and so with this data you can calculate the percent of active cells across these Lakes so this is just an example of what this data set looks like these are just four of the 13 or 14 lakes that we were able to do this with on the left the lakes are ordered and decreasing pH and I thought it was also kind of interesting the color changes so you can admire those I don't know why they do that but that's the way it is and then in the middle are the dappy stain cells under the microscope and then on the right are the active cells that are tagged with the green fluorophore and you can also notice like the different cell morphologies and abundances that change with ph which is really fascinating and also that pH didn't affect the assay itself we do see some cells that are active at these low PHS and sometimes you have brines where there's less activity happening there so when you calculate the percent of active cells and you put this all in a plot I'll just Orient you so on the x axis here we have water activity decreasing and on the y axis is pH decreasing in this direction so you would expect the most extreme acidic brines to be kind of in this region this dotted line is that newly predicted water activity limit of life that I talked about earlier and then this dotted line represents the percent of active cells dropping below 50 percent at this pH so this color block each of the dots is one Lake and the color bar was colored on a green gradient if the percent of active cells is above 50 percent and on a gradient towards black if it was below 50 so you can kind of just visually see that all of the green like high percentage act cells cluster up here and all of the low percent of active cells clustered down here and when you look at it statistically there is a moderately stronger correlation with ph and activity compared to water activity and activity so so many times you can count how many times I say activity in this talk um and so some thoughts on this a pH of six is really high for environmental samples and as we've heard from a lot of people and as we know there's a lot of microbes that live in way more acidic environments so what's actually happening here I don't have an answer to that yet and I'm hoping to figure that out with future analyzes that include nanosims work on these Lakes um and then if this is a true signal and this is what what is going on in the environment then microbial activity may be detected at lower water activities than we know of now as long as the pH is within the seven to eight maybe like not so acidic range um so figuring out what that PH range is and how that interacts with water activity limits of life um is something of ongoing investigation so with that I'd like to acknowledge my lab the deaca slab pictured up in the right all of our funding sources the oceans across space and time team which is a nasa funded project you'll hear about uh you'll hear from a lot of us throughout this conference and all of our collaborators in Western Australia including Molly the dingo who of course this work would not have been possible without all right and then I'll take any questions and I'll leave this up so you can stare at the dots for a little bit longer [Music] [Applause] any questions hi uh that was really cool talk thanks so much um I was just wondering if he could expand a little bit on why you concentrate onion anabolic um activity as opposed to catabolic activity yeah so let's see scientifically the reason why I would focus on anabolic activity I mean both catabolic and anabolic activity are essential for life right life has to make energy to assimilate substrates and ground divides so both processes are really important um and they are processes that I'll be combining or looking at in future field sites um with anabolic activity the interesting thing here is that you could imagine that when a cell gets really stressed out it would stop dividing potentially and still accumulate substrates to repair DNA repair cell walls do all that stuff until conditions get better and so the idea was that or my original hypothesis was that by um that anabolic activity would extend beyond the known cell division limit of life because even as cells are um cells would be able to survive just by taking up materials and so that taking up process is the anabolic Activity Part yeah sweet talk I have a question so um you mentioned that you guys have essentially like uh extrapolated uh new like limit for life like in terms of water activity it's kind of a power move so we're not the first ones to do this okay but okay but uh could you explain how you extrapolated that because I think maybe I missed that or I didn't understand yeah um okay we're gonna get into the weeds here but let me go back to that slide so this this idea or this like extrapolation is based on um these this study here so they did the same thing and this is how they got this theoretical limit of life that has now been cited almost 200 times from food preservation fields to life detection Fields so um hasn't been published yet um so the reason so they used a different technique and they based it on cell division and so we're um so hang on let me answer your first question so um the way that we did this is single cell analysis allows you to separate the cells that are active from those that are inactive and in a brine environment this is really important because brines are really salty and cells can fall in from anywhere bird poop wind whatever and get preserved and those can be inactive so those can contribute to that bulk analysis and not necessarily even be important in that environment so with single cell analysis we took out the active cells average their anabolic activities so we're just focusing on who's contributing to metabolism in that environment and then use detection limits and and math to extrapolate and predict or propose this new predicted limit of detectable life and so this is not the limit of life this is what our measurements can detect and if we found an environment at 0.54 Water activity with similar conditions to this environment that we extrapolated it from we would technically be able to detect life in that environment and this is also a really conservative limit so um we even upped the number of standard deviations that we would normally do for our like detection limit so if we were to do like our data processing in the normal way it might even be lower that kind of hey George eibel from Montana State I'm just curious uh you're looking at the Active cells were you did you look at who they were at all whether that was by fish or sequencing so in this study we did not look at cell identity and we focused um on metabolism in Western Australia I don't have plans to look at the actual like I don't know I could look at the Active fraction of cells from the bond cat analysis I haven't decided if I want to go down that road yet but in the next field site we are planning on on doing that so um yeah not in this not in a city all right thank you very much Emily yeah thank you [Music] thank you
