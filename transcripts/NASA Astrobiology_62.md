is I need them to [Music] upload I have no idea I can't get I don't know [Music] or just [Music] that's fine I just [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I [Music] you know if there's a way to I so like I would prefer not to use my laptop for everyone's cuz the week is there a way to like a flash drive into this just can't get any of this [Music] [Music] I try there I don't actually see [Music] oh wait I do anything you get up on screen will come back to me the broadcast so it's all good whatever way you do it just to make [Music] [Music] right [Music] I can't figure out the I'm not going to mess with that I'm having everyone email to me no I'm saying I can't get I can't figure last Drive thing out so I'm just going to have everyone email it to me no I know that's fine but I'm talking about the first session they're not they just connect or yes see this is what he's saying use this USB stick to transfer uh files to the PC you can also use the USB part for the slided is this on is this oh that's on uh you can also use the USB part for the slide advance [Music] I want to unplug this that's how you do and then here have it on mute [Music] [Music] also see [Music] you I see like think um [Music] [Music] this [Music] you this is just but it says [Music] you it doesn't [Music] [Music] first people so we can otherwise they'll just have to be over [Music] [Music] here oh did it do [Music] so only [Music] basically I don't think I [Music] think otherwise otherwise they can just [Music] only from only from [Music] that but they can [Music] unless they have that but they had to get really close so that's why I was going to say like no it's stuck in there hello [Music] so let's see you that one I hello only I think [Music] [Music] that's sorry that's what I'm [Music] I got you the [Music] [Music] I can [Music] [Music] just uh the one another [Music] [Music] testing [Music] yeah is my first yes I do I said okay okay sorry I was just making sure I was just repeating it to myself [Music] [Music] oh it is it uh regardless this is there's a laser uh this should work once you upload your talk you have your talk on a or anything can you uh give that drive to me [Music] yeah just [Music] all right hey Jay is this the is this the font you had okay I'm just making sure that this cuz if I save it it doesn't but it should be this presenter how it shows moving on the stage okay and then this um there is a mic here but we can also like going see once this this this goes with this [Music] is [Music] [Music] I would like for the end of after 10 [Music] minutes I was just making sure that it was okay [Music] yeah so I didn't save it I just yeah yeah that's [Music] [Music] yeah here [Music] are you keeping yours on the [Music] you can do something different for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] are they going to yes can [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm not going to worry about this it's too much that's just Bing when I talk because I don't want to be I fig [Music] fig okay need to figure out how to yeah we need to turn mute this testing testing testing testing hello hello testing I think let's see testing sounds good A bit welcome to my talk guys I think it's good right yeah yeah yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning everybody please quickly find a seat so we can get started on time for our very first session so exciting [Music] a quick housekeeping announcement if you presenting in an upcoming session try to come up a few minutes early to make sure your slides look fine um if you didn't for this session that's okay CU we're still going to get started and get rolling um if you didn't pick up your name tag yesterday I will have those at the coffee break at 10: if I can remember uh and Taylor is going to introduce our first session okay our first session is going to be hydrothermal vents the chues of life thank Justin in the front row for that name um all right our first speaker is Myan J kubendran sumati talking about the unveilling thermal adaptation in organisms insights from an energy Centric perspective in astrobiology take it away [Applause] can you all hear me all right yes cool so that's my title and it's it was done with help of chat GPT so if you guys want you can ask nice titles do you guys like the weather at Carell yeah good but I bet if I ask you to put your hands in a boiling water you would not right but then there's there are a bunch of microorganisms that they it's not just they can tolerate these high temperatures but rather they need this high temperature to grow and those are the microorganisms I'm going to talk about and I'm going to ask a bunch of questions and discuss more about them so what is this temperature and why is that such a big thing so temperature affects everything in life from physical to biological parameters it decides how much of gases that's going to be uh soluble in any uh environment and on the vi iCal side is going to talk about how stable are the biomolecules going to be at what rate are the enzyme reactions going to happen and how fast can an organism move and so on so all the microorganisms that we find in hydrothermal vents or any other super hard systems they are practically microorganisms that have overcome these kind of issues and so overcoming these issues is rather simple you know it's it's going to get hot and then you turn on your air conditioning right that's that's as simple as that but then there is one small problem if air conditioning was never invented and then I'm going to tell you well it's 85Â° F today but tomorrow it's going to be 105 would you be able to cope starting tomorrow so probably not uh but if you could you can cope for a week a month but eventually you're going to die so but for microorganisms this is going to be pretty fast and so the question is where did these adaptations come from these adaptations that we see today they definitely confer uh adaptation towards high temperature but is that what drove their survival at high temperature so I look back at the ancestors and if you guys are familiar with the last Universal common ancestor you know the debate about whether it was a hyper thermopile whether it was a misop or a thermop but let's not look at Luca yet let's go back to the ancestors of bacteria and ARA that's where we have consensus that they were definitely microorganisms that were already adapted to temperature so it's you know in some sense saying that our ancestors invented air conditioning and they passed down the information to us and those that's what we are going we are using today but then Luca we have the debate so in my study to understand how any life would adapt to high temperature I was stuck there because it's like there is low temperature high temperature we don't know what Luca was where do I start and then my Pi said why not do everything so I said okay let's assume that Luca was a low temperature organism so what happened was it went from low temperature uh to high temperature when it became the ancestor of bacteria and ARA and then went on to adapt to all these uh other environments or if it was it was an high high temperature microorganism that went on to be the ancestral high temperature microorganism and adapted to other environments this makes me ask three questions how did low temperature microorganism adapt to high temperature and how did high temperature microorganisms you know change themselves as they survive low lower temperatures and finally why don't we find today's organism Crossing this temperature barrier and going to high temperature and this is important because most of the uh experimental evolutionary studies that where they grow these microorganisms at higher and higher temperature they all come to a standpoint they cannot push this barrier further so what is stopping this thing and as I just said experimental evolution is not going to take us far so this is where I come into I said you know what how about if you try modeling let's try to create models uh particularly evolutionary models which is going to allow us to test evolutionary strategies can this organism evolve uh a set of traits that would adapt it to adapted high temperatures so some you know conditions we need for the model is that I'm talking about Luca and all microorganisms and probably all life so the model that I'm making has to be General and it should be applicable for all microbes and all life and it should also determine the thermal boundaries as to like what would be the lowest limit be for that organism or what would be the highest limit and you have a bunch of other requirements the model should fulfill this is where I present to you so come with me on this journey and I have three important slides basically so that's all I'm trying to uh convey here this is the first slide explanation of of the model so we know that all microorganisms need energy and that's constant and be it carbon based life or even silicon based life or any other life life means that you move yourself out of equilibrium and stay in that situation so the way life on Earth Works is that it takes substrates converts them into products called catabolism produces free energy converts that into ATP molecules which can then be used for anabolism now what happens in anabolism is that you could have spend your energy that you get into two different ways one is to maintain yourself which is very important because if you cannot fulfill that energy you're going to uh die basically and the second thing is cell division and the way we are modeling that is that since you need to be alive first you will have to fulfill this maintenance energy and whatever energy you have after that is what is going for growth so you have let's say a very little energy after your maintenance needs you're going to grow very slow but if you have a lot of energy you're going to grow quickly and this is what we see across eoli which has like 20 minutes lifetime or for those microorganisms that live in uh DC hydrothermal vents which have like 5,000 years of one cycle so what does this tell us by using this concept we can have a plot like this that explains biology basically the green line here is basically at what rate you're going to get your catabolic energy in so the way the green curve is shaped is basically a simple enzyme kinetic curve as you increase the temperature you're going to reach an Optimum condition where you're going to be the fastest at getting the energy out and beyond that your energy is going to decrease and the orange curve is how much you how much it costs to maintain yourself with regards to temperature and Studies have said that it should follow some sort of an uh uh exponential increase now if you start with a very low energy this is how you should it should you know increase but if you're going to start with very high maintenance cost you would have app PL something like this which increases rather quickly and the idea here is you could just do it's like you know 2 power x as a simplest model and it could be like if you start at two you're going to take to reach 2 million you're going to take much longer than if you start at 20 you know so with this idea what we have is that this space within which the energy that you get is higher than the cost that you need to provide so you can only survive in this space and all the space outside here your maintenance cost is way higher than what you get from the environment so no survival there and these points are the points where the limits so as I said this model can tell me the limits uh survivability and within this Spas it becomes more of an optimization problem where the cell is just has to optimize itself to its maximum difference so that it could grow the f fastest so this is what uh the overall outline of this model is so and then I went on to see okay I have this model now but how are these microorganisms that are already at high temperatures doing uh you know working with these kind of models with their energy and what I find is that most of the microorganisms that are at high temperature particularly above 90Â° C are only arare so there must be something special about them right and what is special and what has been found PR previously is that ARA tend to reduce their maintenance cost you know as I said if you start at a lower maintenance you're going to start lower and increase the cost way slower and that's what RK are doing so I was like well that makes sense because now I have some form of evidence for that my thinking is correct so then I asked okay so if ARA reduce their maintenance cost what contributes to this cost and depending on the different uh situation this could be different but these are the key you know Pathways that you need to have in a Cell which is taking in the substrate catabolizing it you know Gene regulation making ATP molecules making the proteins making the enzymes that needs to be there doing all the other functions so and what is interesting is that all these things are functions of enzymes everything uses enzymes in almost everything uh uses enzymes in Earth so increasing the number of enzymes is like starting with a higher maintenance energy so that's the first uh hypothesis I was thinking so if I if a cell is going to have a super complex network of biochemistry then it's going to start at a much higher maintenance energy and it's going to go faster so then I asked so how do all of these relate and this is another plot how I'm going to tell you how The evolutionary Cycles could be and we're going to shift between these two plots so consider this moderately temperature microorganism with uh this survival space so if it wants to go to a higher temperature so what it has to do is decrease its maintenance energy so thereby moving this red line slightly lower now you have this new blue space that this life can occupy and that Green Spot over there is a much higher temperature than it originally was or could so then its optimization problem it moves these curves by making sure that these enzymes are more ther stable and now has this new high temperature space where the microorganism could grow so that's how it goes as yellow and then turns as red so if you do this you could have a space like this and this is all hypothesis this is all what I thought it could be working like this and usually what happens is that at lower temperature your temperature stress is alleviated which means that you can access much more options you could go for different metabolisms different uh sugars highly complex sugars and so much and increase your complexity so this is what I thought would be happening with this uh life and this white space that you see would rather be a space that is inaccessible for any life and the reason is because in this space if you have a complexity that's going to be super high to adapt to such high temperatures and so I asked two questions is it true that these microorganisms that live at higher temperatures uh shift their maintenance energy curves lower and you know do complexity vary with temperature and the first result is yes and this is raw data so it's not super clean but what you see is that microorganisms the more they go towards high temperature they are kind of shifting their maintenance curve lower and lower like the example I showed you and for the second test I did uh I analyzed complexity for around like 6,000 species and I ended up with 3,000 samples and what I find is that complexity sure is negatively related and as you go higher up at temperature you're going to be lower and lower complex what was really interesting for me is that I found the same Trend the inaccessible space happening in all these slides this white space where we don't find any life on Earth suggesting that there is much stronger correlation to what I was proposing and the data that we are observing and these are strong correlations that I find not cation so we have to test them and we have to give them proofs and this is where I am going to end where you can have this kind of idea and these curves written up as a simple model where this is the green curve this is the red curve and this is the ultimate growth and in an evolutionary model what we do is we say okay there is a mutant that can change these uh conditions and if such a mutant can come up can that you know change the growth rate and succeed in that high temperature environment or not so that's the evolutionary model that we going to test and what's the significance of this is that this model I'm developing in context of temperature but if anyone is interested in pressure you could rewrite all these parameters as a function of pressure and do the same plot for pressure and understand how any life would behave with regards to temperature and remember this is an evolutionary space so which basically means that it is only within the space the microorganisms can evolve and adapt you cannot go outside of the space so and one more extra cool thing is that it just doesn't have to work for carbon it can also work for silicon based life if you can find what is the biochemical reaction that uh you know silicon based life would bring you energy and what is the biochemical reaction that silicon based life would use to build itself up and there you have the parameters of this equation and you could get a similar plot so this could inform a huge number of things about astrobiology and also help us understand how microorganisms adapt and evolve in general and with that I would like to thank you and I would like to take any [Applause] questions yes this one so this is uh a graph which we call Parise invisibility plot which is what you use to test your evolutionary models and the idea well in in the simplest way it's it's really complicated for me to explain now but the idea here is that you can find different of these points they could be either stable points and attractors or stable points and repellers so which means that if I have a say you know the best way to explain is okay this one if I have a mutant over here and if this Center Point is a stable point and an attractor it means that any Mutant that could have a better strategy is going to go towards the steady Point steady state so which means you can keep pushing yourself to find the boundary but if it was a something like a repeller then what you could just have is that no matter what mutations you can have in genes or what changes you could do in a Cell you will never cross that boundary point so that's that's talking about darious uh uh all the different parameters that you could use but it would ideally be like for this blot you would get one pairis invisibility plot which is just one of these squares and then you will analyze that further yeah yeah so again it's it's the Dynamics between the maintenance cost so at high temperature if you are more complex it means that you need more maintenance cost but the rate at which you get the energy from the environment it cannot just be fast enough for you to satisfy your maintenance needs and that's why you're going to be like you're going to basically starve at that temperature where what usually would happen and when we go very close to thermodynamic limits is that you will often find like a decoupling where your energy is going to come in but that's just not enough for you to sustain yourself so you cannot like it's something like you know the the if if you take some fat loss regime where it's like we cut down the diet so then the reason is that our fat is being burnt out so if you keep doing that you're going to starve and you're going to die eventually so that's what is actually happening and that's what is limiting this microorganism going to the spaces yes I mean so there should be a low temperature cut off off to be metabolically active but what happens at low temperature is that you could go into a you know freezing state where you could not be metabolically active but just sustain your viability forever so that's that's kind of like it gets a little bit complicated and I first thought high temperature would be more complicated but turns out colder is much more complicated so I I mean I would love to work on that but I just don't know how so if you have ideas I would love to yeah yes yeah perfect question I forgot to mention that so how this can inform us about the Luca debate whether it was low temperature or high temperature is that the ultimate conclusion I'm having is it doesn't matter Luca was simple enough to be at mesophilic condition thermophilic condition and hyperthermophilic condition and that's why probably maybe we have this confusion of whether it was a low temperature or a high temperature because if you are simple enough as I showed you in the first plot you could make that low complexity across all the temperature regimes so that's where I mean it gets complicated to really really pinpoint whether Luca was thermophilic or hyperthermophilic but I think it really doesn't matter to us as long as it's simple so what we could inform is that Luca has to be uh simple unless we find a definite prove that it's mopic and it was more complex you had a question so indeed so all these parameters that I said you know these are all temperature based parameters and you they don't have to be temperature based parameters if you could figure out how these uh you know catabolic energy at the rate at which you get and the maintenance cost would vary with regards to pressure so what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to estimate this in lab where I culture these microorganisms at different temperatures and I see how that the exponential curve actually increases but if you're say interested in pressure you could do the same and you could have a plot where it's like okay this is how the maintenance cost varies with pressure or say pH and now you know that and you can again use how those chemical reactions that get the energy in behave with regards to pressure and pH conditions and that is going to inform you about how you might find a similar plot for pressure so that's not what I'm working on but you can definitely do that with these kind of models we're going to move on um thank Jay [Applause] again e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] sh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for e e e e e e e [Applause] e e okay our next speaker will be Sarah Gonzalez Han now bi talking about biopolymers and serpentinization Associated extreme environments and their significance for the h ability of microorganisms and extraterrestrial systems take it away Sarah good morning good morning everyone my name is Gonzalez I'm thir year okay hello yeah so um my name is Sarah Gonzalez I'm a first year PhD student at Michigan State University and today I will be talking about uh biopolymers in serpentinizing systems and the implications for habitability and life detection so among the extreme environments on Earth um one of the most intriguing are serpentinizing environments which are a product of water Rock reactions we have uh the serpentinization reaction which consist on on the reaction of Olivine and peroxin minerals with water which produces the serpentine mineral and as a by product we have hydrogen and methane when we also have heat and this uh reaction produces high pH conditions and on Earth we have uh Marine serpentinization such as in the L City hydrothermal bands but we also have a terrestrial serpentinization or Continental serpentin station such as in the santena ofite and today I'm I'm going to focus in these two serpentinizing systems the LA City and santena so uh for santena ofite it as I said as I said is a terrestrialization site located in the Northwestern Pacific coast of Costa Rica and it is uh quite intriguing because it has a strongly contrasted contrasting wet and dry seasons that Mak Santa Lena a unique hydrogeological setting where the water Rock reactions and are enhanced by the large storm Vents and there are also hyper hyperline Springs being produced of about uh pH 11 Point High so it's quite high and interestingly Selena ulite is a Mars analog considering that within the N poser region of Mars the Mars reconnaissance Orbiter detected uh Serpentine minerals and there are a lot of uh minerological similarities between santena and the lios region of Mars so it is a potential analog that can be studied on the other hand we have the LA City hydrothermal field which is a deep sea serpentinizing environment located in the midatlantic reach and it has a high temperature conditions is metal poor it is highly alkaline a pH of around from 9 to 11 and uh there is a low biomass but High species diversity and they are acly venting uh carbonate chimney in the LA City and interestingly the LA City is an analog of ocean worlds specifically Europa and Enceladus and um considering that there might be hydrothermal activity in these two moons that can provide uh habitable conditions for life such as liquid water but also chemical energy for then for the metabolism of microbes so uh in within the l City but also in santena there are active microbial communities growing and a very intriging question is how these microbial communities are thriving as at such high ph and high temperatures so there are different mechanisms for that microbes can use to survive and one of them are biofilms so this is a protective layer that microbes secrete in order to protect themselves and they create a micro environment so biofilms in general are secretions that facilitate attachment to surfaces in this case could be mineral faces and that lead to the for the formation of microbial uh communities microbial bofilm communities and they have um many uh functions including drop protection uh signaling trap of nutrients among others and these biofilms are composed of extracell or polymeric substances or EPS that are comprised of five different biomolecules the exopolysaccharides which are the main component we also have proteins extracellular enzymes Edna and extracellular vesicles and biofilms are of astrobiological relevance considering that they have implications for the habitability of microbes in extreme environments but also in extraterrestrial systems and they can also provide uh new bio signatures to detect life since some of these bi biomolecules are highly resistant to degradation and they can interact with mineral faces that Aid in it its preservation so uh these biofilms have not been studied in depth in Santa Elena and the LA City so why studing biofilms in serpentinizing Associated uh extreme environments is relevant because they can inform us about the habitability on Mars Europa and Enceladus they can inform about the strategies that microbes used to cope with a high pH stress and also they can offer new bio signatures to detect life so um we used some sequencing data specifically metagenomic data to um uh analyze uh biofilms specifically in from LA City and Sant Elena and therefore we were interested in exploring the potential of eps biosynthesis by bacteria in santena but also in the last City we're using a Mythic approach so specifically we focus on the exopolysaccharides which remember are the main component of the biofilms and so we look at the biosynthetic gene clusters that encoded for these exop polysaccharides in the metagenomes of these two environments and um and uh in second place we wanted to know what type of microbes were producing these exopolysaccharides using metagenome assembled genomes which are genomes reconstructed from DNA of microbial communities and in third place we analyze the relationship between minerals and the uh exopolysaccharide genes that we found in these metagenomes uh this this one was specifically for the lost city and we analyzed two carbonate minerals brucite and aragonite which are common minerals in the carbonate chimneys of the law City and uh so the samples collected from santena are from two hyper Aline Springs which had a pH of around 115.5 so that's quite high and for the LA City the samples were were collected by Dr Osama alien during a deep sea expedition to the law City in 2018 so what did we find in these metagenomes so for the last City we found a a a wide diversity of exopolysaccharides being produced so we found 10 different types and the sing and exopolysaccharide had the highest abundance for the L City we found similar Trends so we found a high diversity of eps types around 11 types and again the singan was the most abundant so interestingly the singan is actually a family of exopolysaccharides that are anionic EPS that uh can produce agar likee structures they have highly conserved biosynthetic genes but most importantly they have high stability over wide pH ranges and wi temperatures and these um this is the main reason of why these uh of the abundance of these EPS under these high ph and high temperature environments in SEC uh in second place we wanted to know what type of um what microbes were producing uh these EPs and so here uh have the results for uh Santa Lena here you can see the order and the different types of eps being produced and we found in general um a high number of uh exopolysaccharides produced by the different microorganisms where Santo mades had the highest uh EPS uh High had the highest diversity of eps types and it is a well known cilic order and we also find that b Cales was enriched in the sphing Eng jees and uh these are the results for delity again we see uh this is the order and the different types of eps we found a high diversity of eps being produced by uh the different bacteria and in general the meales had the highest diversity poales and this diversity of exopolysaccharides being produced highlights the critical role for establishing the biofilms and conditioning the environment for further colonization of of microbes that allows them to to thriving at such high phes high temperatures and so in third place uh we did some correlations of these exopolysaccharide genes that we find with um the mineral some mineral data specifically brucite and aragonite and in this table you can see the most significant correlations for the uh exopolysaccharides which were for the spingen family and but also for the polyan acidic glucosamine and we found very interesting trends like in general we found positive correlations with brucite but negative correlations with aragonite so why is this Brite is a magnesium hydroxide mineral that can act as an absorbent of organic compounds and it is stable at high temperatures and remember that these are conditions that we see in the lost city so this can help explain this positive relationship but also uh for the sping inam uh we have a high stability over a wide RTI of temperatures so Bru site can act as a mineral phase for the formation of biofil and these uh findings are supported by uh this conf focal laser scanning microscopy analysis that Dr Osama alien did so here you can see a section of the hydrothermal chimney and in San you can see the bru site any red the is the aragonite and when he stain with dappy which is um uh stain for the nucleic acids here you can see um bacteria conglomerates or bacteria of biofilms associated directly with the brucite so coming back to to the table for the aragonite which where we saw negative uh relationships Um this can be explained by the unstable nature of paragonite because this is a mineral that tends to convert over time to calide which is the stable form and so uh to conclude uh bacteria in Santa Elena and in the LA City have the capacity of synthetizing different exopolysaccharide types and this abundance and diversity of eps types has a strong implications for astrobiology specifically in terms of the habitability that they can provide to microorganisms but also can provide potential bio signatures for detecting life and santena and the law city which are which which are a terrestrial and Marine serpentinizing system can serve as a potential analoges for Mars but also water worlds such as uh Enceladus and Europa and are key sites for astrobiological research uh to study habitability and life detection and uh future directions so for my uh thesis re research I'm going to focus I'm going to do a holistic study on biofilms from santena offield we recently did a sampling uh trip uh to Santa Lena during uh the dry season and we found uh two very interesting hyper Aline Springs where we collected biofil samples so this is one of them uh it was it had a pH around 11.6 and this other uh hyper alkaline Springs was quite intriguing because it was located in a small Steep and at the bottom what the river was flowing uh the pH was 8.86 and at the top was 11.25 so there was a pH gradient um within um less than a meter so it was like quite uh relevant for like studying microbes and uh habitability conditions and so what do we want to do with uh these uh biofilms we want to analyze um do analys metagenomic analysis metatranscriptomics we want to characterize the uh diverse EPS components not just the exop polysaccharides uh through different approaches so microscopy biochemical and spectroscopic techniques and cariz the EPS mineral interactions as it's uh highly relevant for uh bi signatures preservation and uh we hopefully want to do another uh field sampling trip during the wet season to compare like both and uh dry season and like the Dynamics of it of the biofilms with that I would like to thank my uh advisor Dr mat shank and the shr lab uh Dr Ricardo Sanchez Mario Willam brasleton and Dr Osama alian thank you very [Applause] much we have five minutes for questions hi great talk um I'm wondering um at the field sites how do you distinguish or do you distinguish between B films you're collecting and like carbonate mineralization or do you just assume this is all a bofilm and collect it all well um so um usually people think uh of biofilms as thick um um like secretions like you see here like here uh but also but biofilms could also be like um conglomerates of cells that are not being seen so um we collected directly like carbonate minerals from this Springs so you can see there were a lot like um at the bottom of this rock we found um a lot of carbonates which we collected and preserved and we want to do with that we want to stain them with dappy to get to see um like uh conglomerates of cells and where where we can tell that there U might be a biofilm so um so we found like we took these carpent minals but also we took like these kinds of uh slimy biofilms so uh there are different forms in which you can find them thanks for the talk um how abundant me how abundant are the EPS uh producing mags overall compared to the how abundant are the mags specifically found to contain the jeans like relative abundance your sample for those Megs for for instance for the LA City uh we found so for the LA City we have um like more samples like around 10 samples so we were able to construct uh more metag genome assemble genomes and uh in the relative abundance of these uh um so we selected we did a a filter of the um like high quality Maxs and like the relative abundance was like higher than like I would say 60% so it was uh like quite uh for the L city which we had like more samples in contrast in contrast for santena we had just two metag genum that were collected previously so we were able to build like you see more like uh lack of information compared to the last City so the were not able to fge a lot of high quality Maxs and the like abundance was LE less than like 50% I will say so that's why we want to focus on like collecting more bofilm samples from Sant Elena since we don't have like a lot of information and I I took some two previews like previous data to like look into B fils thank you very much um at your terrestrial opalite opalite are you seeing um in your thicker biofilms like laminations that might be stattic or like at least a trapping and binding of R aggregate or anything just like the the Proto or a stattic feature in that thing um no we are not seeing like uh a stromatolite like formations so we're actually seeing more like um very um like like carbonate soft carbonates mixed with water but not like rocky rocky formations and in this in this in the hyper alkaly Springs but for this one uh we actually like uh found layers of car carbonates that were um like were pre like actively precipitating carbonates so um that was kind of interesting so we also took samples of that but we mostly found these types of like um carbonates mixed with water on the bottom of the Springs thank you [Music] for e all right our last talk in this session will be from Sylvia nup and her talk is titled identifying translationally active microbes in The Gua Basin deep biosphere so take it away syvia also this is a really cool video how to start this off thanks and is that working yes okay not yet is it good yeah good all right sweet hi thank you for the introduction um all right what you're seeing here is a submarine landing on the bottom of the sea floor at guus Basin with a play payload to collect samples at this site so this is going to be my study site for today and our search for life on other planets one of the main focuses might be life in the subsurface of planets and moons the reason being these environments are probably more protected from space hazards like UV radiation meteor sites meteor strikes Etc and these environments might also Harbor more conditions that are like Life as we know it for instance on incel the subsurface oceans are liquid water they have hydrothermal vent systems which might heat up the water and they also have organic molecules present however we don't have good ways to study these ecosystems yet and so we need to develop these methods before we have any chance of figuring out if life exists here to do this we can use subsurface environments on Earth as a an analog site so the Deep biosphere of Earth is defined as any organisms living below one meter below the surface of the Earth so anything deeper than that all the organisms and rocks all that sort of stuff this environment is much more extensive than we have thought previously by some estimates 65% of all microbes live in the subsurface but these environments are really really difficult to study for one cell abundances are very low as you can see here as we get from the surface where our cell concentrations are like 10 to the E cells per cubic centimeters even 100 MERS below the surface this concentration drops to less than 100 cells per square centimeter so this makes it incredibly difficult to study not to mention that a lot of these organisms are dormant are not very active and so that makes a lot of our traditional microbi microbiological techniques really difficult to execute here so for instance our culturing methods do not work as effectively so we need other methods in order to study these microbes in this environment my lab uses this method called boncat fax which is bioorthogonal non canonical amino acid tag tagging tied with florescence activated cell sorting that's like a really big mouthful but the important part is that're we're trying to identify translationally active microbes by tagging those proteins that are being newly made so the way we do this is with a synthetic amino acid it's called hpg which is a substitute for methionine so we can incorporate this into cells that are making new proteins extract these cells from the sediments and then attach a fluorophor to this hpg molecule using click chemistry and so now we can have fluorescent cells that are the ones that have that are making new proteins we can use this to our advantage to put into a fluorescence activated cell sorter so we can sort out these active cells and then we can take these cells and we can sequence their DNA in order to determine the identity of these cells so my goal in this is to apply this to the Deep biosphere of guus basin and so any samples below the surface and I'm particularly interested in the activity of all three domains of life bacteria ARA and ukara and seeing if all three domains of life are active in order to do this the samples need to be collected on the iodp 385 um cruise on the jid's resolution they took gigantic cores down to 150 M below the seafloor for micro biological analysis we took these samples incubated with hpg attached the floor for now we have active cells and that's what we're searching for is this active fraction of cells so our lab has developed this bonat fact methodology and it works really really amazingly for both bacteria and ARA but it has never been tested on UK carots before so we were particularly interested in fungi and so we needed to test if we could even fungi to incorporate hpg into their cells we have two Marine fungi species this is rat torula which is a marine yeast kataphora which is a marine filamentous fungi and we needed to test if we could label them which we can woohoo so the sci five which is the red Dy is our click stained die so all the cells in this sample in this synthetic environment that are red are ones that click stained and so we've got these long the long filamentous cells that you can see around that's the cataphora these like circular cells that's the rat torula and if you look closely you can see these little rod shaped cells which are eoli and so another problem that we had is in cell sorting we need to be able to sort these gigantic cells alongside the tiny procaryotes that are probably the majority of our sample and so we needed to make this synthetic environment in order to see if we could do this at all the answer is yeah it works pretty well we can sort them all at the same time so after doing this we can apply this to my study site which is guus Basin so guus Basin is a fascinating site it's a hydrothermal site in the Gulf of California near the Pacific Ocean it's got five rivers that flow into it depositing tons of sediment it's also highly productive close to the equator it's got tons of photosynthetic organisms and so what happens in this environment is as a sediment and as these or as the sediment Falls as these photosynthetic organisms die they all fall to the seaf floor as what we call Marine snow and they interact with the hydrothermal vent environments there and they thermally alter this organic matter and it makes for a really cool bed of chemistry for life so here's a hydrothermal vent from gu Basin these vents are producing primarily methane which is really unique for a vent site this is because it's thermally altering the carbon that's falling down as Marine snow they're surrounded by these microbial and microbial mats which are beoa that are kind of populating the whole seaf floor here so it's a really rich really hot really active environment on the surface when you go below the surface it looks quite a bit different it's kind of this boring mat mud even one meter below the seafloor you can no longer see the signs of the microbial mats on top all the way down the S sediment column it's just kind of this brown oily very smelly mud but we think that even in this bottom section which has cell concentrations less than 100 cells per centimeter there are active microbes so we need to identify this active fraction of microbes we are using cell sorting to do this basically we send our sample which theoretically has click stained cells into the cell sorder and we get this little cloud of events and we have fluoresence on this y  axis we draw a gate around where we think the positive cells will be based on a negative control sample and this is 154 meters below the sea FL sea Flor lo and behold we get an active fraction of cells so that's what we're calling this the active fraction we extract the DNA here and we get our 16s RNA Gene amplicon sequencing data I'm going to this is a big chart so I'm going to walk through the first section real quick um on the left we have our kind of code here the presort is all of the cells in the community whether they were labeled or not so that's the entire Community the sorted cells are they active fraction of cells that we sorted out and we have classes of organisms sorted by abundance and so if the circle is larger and more yellow they're more abundant in that particular sample so this is our first sample which is just one meter below the sea Flor and we go all the way down to 154 M below the sea Flor these are incrementally down and we find find tons of microbes it's awesome one of the ones that sticks out the most is this gamma proteo bacteria they're super common in the entire sample these are likely heter tropes that are consuming the or organic matter that falls down from the surface we also have really large populations of Alpha proteobacteria bili and dinoy these are also heterotrofos they're likely consuming organic acids some polysaccharides maybe some aromatic compounds and the really cool thing about this is that especially with the dinoy you can see those larger circles for the sorted fraction of cells which means that not only are these guys present they're also actively producing new proteins in this environment which means that they're likely consuming these things that we predict from their genomes diving into the gamma proteobacteria a bit further down to the genus level we can see some very interesting trends for the presort and sorted sample so this Honus is pretty common in a lot of samples but you'll notice that the circles are much larger in these sorted samples and so these guys are like likely more active than you would assume if you were just doing regular abundance studies so we also see the same trend for this Asino actor group one of the more interesting things is that down in this bottom section which is the lowest depth 15 4 M below the sea Flor they're almost not present in the overall Community you're like barely detecting it there's one dot there but when we looked at just the active fraction they're super abundant this is indicative that they're making up a huge section of the active population even though they're not very common in the overall Community these guys are likely way more important than we would predict by genetic data we see the reverse trend for this parab hold area where they look super common in a lot of the samples but then when you go and look at the sorted sections the active sections they're not very common these guys probably a lot of DNA makes it here but they're not really doing anything or if they're doing stuff it's like at a very low level so they're likely less important than the rest of the environment most of these samples are bacteria but of course we've got some ARA here here in the other corner and these guys are also looking very interesting from these samples we have two classes of the asgot ARA which are ARA closely related to ukar and they're present in mainly the surface sediments these guys are heterotroph generalist they can consume complex sugars and peptides and potentially some acetate and what's interesting about them in this environment is that they are in just the surface sediments so so theoretically based on what we've seen by from the bacteria all of their carbon substrates should be at the bottom but for some reason they're not there so something that they need must be missing at these deeper depths additionally we have two classes of methanogens that pop up the methano Methia and the methanosarcina these guys can consume methylated compounds and produce methane so if you remember earlier I told you that a bunch of methane is produced by the hydrothermal vents there's also a biological source of methane now so organisms that are consuming methane in this environment could be getting it from the hydrothermal vents but now they could also be getting it from these deeper samples of the methanogens as well we're still awaiting our fungi sequences but once we get them we'll be able to see kind of the comparison of what they are consuming compar compared to what the bacteria and ARA are doing this is one of our samples of the presorted sample so the whole Community but labeled and so you can see tons of those red little dots that's our click stain those are our active cells there's quite a few of them even really deep so we have a ton of these little cells which we assume are procaryotes but there are also some larger ones like this big circle up top which could be fungi although we don't know for sure until we get the sequencing data back based on previous results we see fungi at these depths from culturing efforts and they're heterotrophs consuming very complex matter like cellulose so it's po possible that they are consuming these really complex organic matter and that's feeding into the bacteria and ARA it could also be possible that these guys are competing with the archa and bacteria and we'll be finding out soon enough so we've determined that bonat FAA is a viable method to detect active organisms in the Deep biosphere from all three domains of life we found that ARA and bacteria are both active in the Deep biosphere we've also determined that heter tropes are kind of dominating this environment even at deeper depths and so it's likely that this organic matter is ending up in these deeper samples much more than we previously assumed that they would be and most importantly life exists deep underneath the surface of the Earth these guys are consuming everything from the surface that falls down into these sediment layers and it's likely that life on other bodies could be doing the same thing being protected from UV from cold temperatures but still benefiting from surface chemistry and so we need to really further explore the Deep biosphere on Earth in order to determine what the actual limits of Life are as we know them thank you guys I want to thank my lab the hatson Pickler Lab at Montana State University um specifically Dr Andrew mcgomery who have worked with this on the worked with me on this entire project and our collaborators Dr Jenny edcom at Woodle oceanographic Institute she is the fungi expert on this and Dr Andreas tesy who was the lead scientist on the cruise that I'll take any questions we've got about two minutes for questions hi thank you for your talk um so I was wondering for your incubation time for the bonat how long were you incubating these cells and are you seeing um that you need to incubate the cells longer than you would for someone you or something yeah that's a really good question so so we didn't know how long it was going to take and so the cells were incubated for 2 days 3 Days 7 days and 14 days we ended up finding that seven days was plenty but 3 days we weren't really seeing many active microbes and so they're definitely way slower in producing new proteins than a surface sample which I've done work on where I can incubate in like a day or two hi interesting talk I'm Abby daring from Georgia Tech um the question I had was about the uh the the fluorescent tag that you're actually using um and and if there's any uh preference given to using that or not using that compared to Native amino acids and untagged uh amino acids and how how you're sure that it's actually integrating into the um the system rather than being ignored by the metabolism of the system yeah yeah yeah that's a great question so let's see if I can back here um so the way that we are basically doing this reaction is it's a yeah click chemistry reaction and so there is an aide group on the hpg molecule that can only click to the there the uh ring there oh my gosh I've forgotten all the names you can only do that by a copper catalyzed reaction which we do after we take the sub cells out and so that is kind of an exclusive reaction and you're not likely to find those like end pieces in a lot of the cells and so that's how we kind of guarantee that those are tagging the exact proteins sure can you give Sylvia another round of applause and if you have any questions for any of the presenters um in the session feel free to ask them over the break so we've got a 20 minute break um for the presenters in the next session uh could you possibly come up here

proteins take it away Peter everyone hear me is this on Perfect all right so uh thank you so much for giving me this opportunity to speak about what I've been working on for the last few years so my lab is primarily a protein engineering lab but we have heavy interest in the origins of life we're trying to look at the origin of life through a protein biochemistry lint and when we're looking at the origin of life through that lens we really want to know how the first proteins may have emerged and how they might have acted in this way I like to compare my work in our lab to a sort of weird version of Jurassic Park so sort of I like to call it like oh we're in the primordial park right where we're trying to almost bring back to life very ancient Prebiotic versions of proteins that might have existed so in order to do this we need to think about the timeline of protein Evolution where where the earliest would have been abiotic synthesis of primordial amino acids so this is really all chemistry this has been experimentally shown to be possible we have very famous experiments such as Miller URI and then we have analyses of meteorites that show that you can get amino acid synthesis without any biotic intervention these would eventually randomly polymerize into um very small small likely completely unfunctional polypeptides which at some point transition into larger functional proteins uh likely compose the very primordial sets of amino acids and then this transitions over hundreds of millions of years into modern proteins that we see today with 20 proteinogenic amino acids and this has sort of been what life has used since Luca 3.5 billion years ago what I'm particularly interested in is this period of time where we're going from random UNF unfunctional polypeptides into functional proteins that would have given some sort of fitness advantage to whatever early form of life existed at the time in order to do this we need to think about what amino acids these early primordial proteins might have been composed of so we use the trifonov uh consensus chronology which is an attempt to order the amino acid incorporation into biology so uh on the earliest side of things we have very simple amino acids such as Glycine and then on the most modern side we have very bulky sort of metabolically complex amino acids with this timeline we can then make arbitrary groupings of these amino acids into what we call alphabets meaning there's different subsets of what amino acid the protein can be made out of where we have the most complex at 20 20 which is essentially modern proteins then we get a little bit less complex with 16 uh in my opinion the most interesting which is the nine amino acid alphabet all of these amino acids are able to be synthesized in the Miller yui experiment and then a sort of extreme example with the five amino acid alphabet with only five extremely basic not chemically basic but extremely simple amino acids with these alphabets we then chemically constructed 10 trillion random proteins so 80 amino acids long but only consisting of the amino acids in each of these four alphabets so now that we have actual proteins made that should be decent models for what might have existed at that origin point we can start to ask questions about what we think these proteins might have been doing the main questions we're really interested in is can you get biological function from these primordial alphabets if they are functional is there any relation ship between the structures we see and the alphabets they come from and then similarly are those structures similar to what we see in modern proteins today in order to answer these questions you need to actually get functional proteins so we selected for proteins that buy into ATP due to its ubiquitous role as an energy currency in life this was successful this was done by Matilda Newton and Kun Le previously um I'm only showing here uh the results from nine amino acid like library for the sake of time but we found binders from every library and then we kinetically characterized a handful of them and what you see here uh based off this binding aay curve is that three of the variants from the nine amino acid Library again meaning it's only consisting out of those nine amino acids that could be found in the Yuri Miller experiment have binding Affinity to ATP that is functionally indistinguishable from Modern protein so this is a huge deal it means that from sort of random sequence space you can find proteins that behave at least on a surface level very similar to things that have evolved over billions of years but the big question is how do they do this and how indistinguishable is the structure and method of this function so order to sort of justify this why do we care so much about the structure so I need to introduce uh sequence space if you're not familiar with this term think about um every possible combination of amino acids as a huge space that you can sample out of and on the sort of Y AIS or z axis I guess you have how good at some given quality that protein is so in our case binding to ATP when we look at these protein structures there's really two possibilities either they look very similar to Modern proteins or they look not like modern this is interesting because if they look similar that implies that life has maybe sampled enough of the sequence space that it's found the optimal way to bind ATP in our case you can imagine at at some point there's an origin of life event and then Evolution takes hold and it slowly increases Fitness until we reach this point where life really doesn't have much imp Improvement that it can make alternatively if we see that it's unlike modern proteins that might imply that life is a frozen accident meaning that some origin Point occurred and it reached a peak but due to the fact that there's these detrimental valleys around it it can't get out and therefore there's a lot of unexplored potentially really interesting biochemistry my hypothesis is that we're more likely to find these novel binding mechanisms that imply a frozen accident due to the fact that most of these alphabets are extremely Limited in the amino acids that they so for some context this is a previously selected ATP binder from a random sequence it but it contains all 20 amino acids this was done by uh Tony Keef in 2001 and at a glance you see the structure and it doesn't look anything um super indistinguishable from Modern proteins however it is somewhat novel the distinct components that bind to zinc and the ATP um are reminiscent of what we see in uh today's proteins however the combination of them is novel so this isn't really an answer to either of those scenarios it's sort of a merger of the two so when we look at how it binds ATP specifically it uses positively charged residues to bind to the phosphate groups and then aromatic pie stacking with the adenosine so this is very similar to what we see in modern ATP finders the way that they were able to make these observations was through uh x ray crystallography of the protein structure and we would like that to be possible for all of these proteins that we're interested and we have over 20 though and x ray crystallography is somewhat low throughput so um in the meantime while we're trying to get structural data we can use uh computer modeling to try to give us a better idea of what we're working with in terms of structure so I'm sure a lot of you have heard of alpha fold it's sort of a groundbreaking protein structure modeling tool so Alpha fold 2 was the big deal for the last few years and the important thing to know is that it largely relies on uh what's called multiple sequence alignments meaning you give it a sequence of your protein and it Compares it to many sequences in a database and anytime there's something that thinks is similar it'll look at the known proteins and say what does this look like and try to fit that into the sequence that you give it the problem with that is our proteins are not related to anything that has ever existed and their sequences are very strange so aold sort of struggled with this you can see uh on the bottom is the confidence rating where the more orange is less confident and these structures are very unconfident and if you know anything about protein folding they don't look very well folded so this was a little disappointing but um not a huge deal we didn't really expect anything groundbreaking from this however about a month ago Alpha fold 3 came out and part of the change from 2 to three was that they claimed to have moved a little bit away from that MSA that multiple sequence alignment so I was really excited uh the day it came out I plugged all these sequences into it to see if it got any better um and unfortunately they didn't really get any better in fact 9C looks worse even though it's a little bit more confident I would say 9d is a little bit better looking but again not confident enough to really uh believe that it think it knows what it's doing at all however the real cool thing about Alpha 3 is that it allows you to do predictions with lians meaning that ATP molecule that these proteins are known to bind to when we introduced ATP and uh metal ions suddenly the predictions become much more confident and much more uh realistic looking so these are completely in the range at which Alpha fold 3 says that it thinks that this is what the protein actually looks like so this was super exciting by no means do I trust this yet these need to be experimentally validated but still it's it was really exciting seeing all this blue pop up for the first time so hypothetically let's look at 9C if this was the structure if if alfold 3 is correct what would we look at this and say about uh that protein sequence space that I was talking about earlier so if we zoom in on this molecule uh we can see a surface of the protein and you actually see a a realistic looking binding pocket that ATP could fit into and zooming into that binding pocket we see a network of hydrogen bonding that is um somewhat realistic and not seen in modern ATP binders additionally we can compare it uh using a tool like fseek which is a protein structure comparison Search tool to Modern protein structures and try to determine on a global level is the structure similar to what we see in modern proteins and based off of this sort of example run we see blue is the 9C Alpha fold 3 structure yellow is a um motor domain and based off these scores this is a poor fit so based off the fact that the hydrogen bonding of the ATP that we see is not similar to what modern ATP binding proteins use and the fact that we're unable to find any um largely similar protein structures if this was truly the structure that we find we would make the case that we' make the claim that this sort of makes it more likely that life is that Frozen accident scenario which I think is really exciting meaning there's a lot of interesting protein biochemistry that's out there to be studied additionally what's I think really cool about Alpha fold three uh is it gives us an opportunity to prove people wrong um if we show that the structures of our proteins are not what Alpha full 3 predicts then we potentially have a large gap in um knowledge to fill that I think is really interesting so this is some uh very preliminary structural data that we have obtained thus far so on the left I'm showing a circular AC cism Spectra um this allows you to determine secondary structural components of proteins which are the these beta sheets and Alpha heles shown in uh that purple and blue and So based off of this it seems like 9C that protein I was showing earlier is about 43 43% Alpha helical based off the alpha fold prediction it should be less than 20 so already there's some discrepancy there additionally we can look at hsqc nuclear magnetic resonancy and this Spectra gives you an idea of the uh sort of global fold of the protein and based off this it might actually entail that this this protein is largely disordered which is also interesting by itself meaning it's uh very sort of flexible and transient in its structure so either of these scenarios already contradict Alpha fold although they might not agree with each other again this is preliminary and we're sort of ironing these out so with that I'd like to just summarize we have ATP binders from primordial alphabets that are functionally indistinguishable from Modern proteins structural modeling has been interesting but we need to experimentally verify it so for now it's questionable so we're collecting structural data to do this um but that is a huge work in progress but hopefully soon T tentatively within the next year we'll get a lot of interesting structural data so with that I'd like to sort of zoom out and I know that there's a very wide uh diversity of fields here um you know when you look up in the sky you see all these Stars you think of there's just like a near infinite number of Worlds that might Harbor weird life and it's just sort of mindboggling to think about protein sequence space is the exact same way and so in another sort of nerdy sci fi analogy I like to think of our lab as a sort of Star Trek ship where we're exploring protein sequence space where no one has gone before so if you remember nothing else remember that we're exploring really weird proteins and might discover stuff that no one has ever seen before so with that I'd like to thank everyone uh particularly from my lab kunai Lee laid laid a lot of the groundwork for this work and then my undergrads who uh really helped me do a lot of this and then our funding and everyone else who's helped me with this so thank you all right looks like we've got a couple questions hi uh Abby daring Georgia Tech interesting talk I was wondering and I'm not a Prebiotic chemist so maybe this is obvious but um why are you looking at ATP binding if you're trying to mimic super simple early early Solutions like isn't ATP kind of complex for these early proteins to be binding to we chose ATP mostly due to the fact that it's seen in so much life today and we it has a lot of things that we can compare to it's it's not like a perfect system that we're saying this is what life looked like when it started it's a it's a very broad model system um so we're not really too attached to the idea is the Lian super prebiotically uh viable although I think ATP has been shown to be uh somewhat prly viable especially when you're looking at like RNA world you need something that can be the building block of those rnas thanks yeah hi uh Taylor paa Notre Dame nice talk I do a lot of work with like RNA World type stuff so I know a lot about like the plausibility of like RNA self polymerization but I don't know much about like what like that looks like for proteins and amino acids in a Prebiotic environment so if you know anything about that that would be very interesting so uh protein specifically there's not really protein self polymerization right now it's all polypeptide okay um the longest that I know has been shown is about a 30mer um so ours are 80 amino acids long so quite longer than that the reason we chose that length was because it's um short enough that it's feasible to work with because we're working with you know tens of trillions of random sequences um but it's long enough where you can get folds that look might look similar to what we see in modern proteins yeah cool thank you hi um cost from W Madison Peter great talk uh I had a question like couple of similar questions so what I was thinking is have you looked at the current ATP binders and how like how similar are The Binding domains within themselves yeah and the second question I had on followup of that is like again how different is The Binding domain let's say the one you found from F3 is it from there and the ones that you see in the extent organism let's say uh that are bind to ATP like how heavily is it uh occupied by the primordial amino acids like do you also see like I don't know the later ones in there so how much would it be affected so um here's some examples of natural ATP binders this these all share one common uh fold or Motif so Motif is a sort of a common way that a protein in this case binds to something so this is called The Walker po Loop Motif um this is really the most common way that modern proteins bind to ATP there's a few others like Rosman Motif um and you can see that it always has this beta Strand and Alpha Helix and this little Loop is always glycine rich and there's a lysine residue which actually inter interacts with that phosphate group and so that's a positively charged residue that occurs in our timeline in the 16 amino acid Library um which means that the five and nine amino acid proteins absolutely cannot have this Motif just necessarily additionally when we look at like the fold of what the alpha fold thought 9C looked like it does not display this sort of uh beta strand Alpha Helix so we've looked into that a little bit um one of my colleagues Sam is actually looking into that a little bit trying to fish out if there's any of these motifs from the binders that we selected uh hi uh I'm Alex Dean Ro from Georgia Tech uh good talk um I'm curious um if there are a lot of hydrophobic residues in that uh uh that uh protein you found that may have an A an intrinsically disordered structure to it because I I I was just thinking that maybe uh that might be why sequences like it aren't found in life because if you have a bunch of exposed hydrophobic stuff then uh it will be prone to aggregating yeah that's definitely a possibility the good news is at least that the concentrations we're working with we don't see any aggregation um but there are there's a ton of veiling um which is hydrophobic um so that's really like that's the big question is we're trying to see what properties do these have yeah thank you yeah give another round of applause for Peter um and I know a couple other people had questions just feel free to ask um during lunch after this next talk it'll show up right over here cool can you all hear me sweet yes um give me one second all right our next speaker last speaker in this session um will be Haley Brown talking about um elucidating planetary scenarios that may lead to an origin of life in warm little ponds take it away Haley hello um like I was already introduced I'm Haley Brown and I'm a first year at Purdue University and I am very excited to talk about warm little ponds and planetary features oh I did not get the clicker there we go cool so in the search for life we all talk about habitability like a ton we have the habitable zone which I have pictured here where we are really interested in looking for life and it's just a term that we all talk about a lot but what it boils down to is a location's ability to maintain liquid water Andor its ability to sustain earthlike life if it was introduced and as we're getting more and more data and exoplanet stuff which I'm super excited about we need to think about narrowing our criteria to actually highlight planets we think could have the highest po possibility of being inhabited Beyond just following the water like we have been and so so to do this a new term has come up called yourability and yourability encapsulates a planet's or location's ability to actually host an origin of earthlike life and to understand your ability we really need to look at Earth because that's the only place we know that an abiogenesis has occurred so a prevailing concept is that Min mineral surfaces oscillating between wet dry Cycles catalyze the original life on Earth and this is kind of the hypothesis that my work is based off of of as I look at what planetary features might influence such an origin so if we're thinking about early Earth for wet dry cycling we're really thinking about volcanic islands and that is because of the phenomena daytime sea breezes and nighttime land breezes that I have pictured here and what these are is they're breezes that arise due to a temperature difference between land and water due to their difference in heat capacities so during the day we have land warming up at a much higher rate than the water next to it and this leads to air flow and precipitation and the inverse of this occurs during nighttime when we have the water retaining heat from the day and the land cooling off very rapidly so even those though these breezes are a local phenomena planetary features influence them through affecting spatio temporal patterns of surface temperature and precipitation one such planetary feature of interest is obliquity or planetary tilt which I have pictured here and and all obliquity is is a planet's tilt on its rotational axis so in respect to its star so here I have pictured 0 45 and 90Â° obliquities if you imagine a volcanic island at the equator on each planet you can see that at zero degree obliquity it would receive Stellar radiation year round 45 degrees it would experience severe Seasons kind of like the seasons we have here on Earth and 90Â° it would be in the middle point between a pole that receives conation during it summer and a pole that is absolutely in winter at that time um also to note on the 90Â° case that equatorial Island would not receive day night cycling so that could drastically affect the land and sea breezes that I talked about earlier so to investigate the effects of obliquity on wet dry cycling for volcanic islands I am using a general climate model called exoplasm and exoplasm has a dynamic atmosphere and a slab ocean and I am using it as at a resolution of 7 64 latitudes and 128 longitudes with 10 atmospheric layers so here I have some of my preliminary results regarding the mean surface temperature for for Global scenarios with different obliquities the black little outlines are little volcanic islands that I have placed and randomly fleshed out with a random walk so you can see in the 15 degree of liquidity we receive the really cold temperatures at the poles and then as obliquity increases we start having an evening out of our temperatures until we get to say the 75 the 90Â° oqu where we have extremely warm temperatures at the poles so this is uh this first plot is kind of a summary of that information of it is the mean surface temperature across islands and I have the latitudes out here um the brightest red is that 90Â° case where we have extremely warm temperatures throughout the year um at the poles and then at the 15Â° obliquity scenario is that brightest blue and we have those really cold temperatures this plot is new as in it shows the mean dial temperature ranges across Islands so all that means is that I'm showing here the mean day toight shift in temperature for each island and you can see it's very interesting that obliquity 15 shows the highest ranges in temperatures and that is because at obliquity 15 in my case scenarios you're getting the maximum amount of day having uh the maximum amount of land having day night shifting because like I said with the 90Â° obliquity scenario during the polar summer that land is just experiencing Cellar radiation it doesn't get a nighttime cycle so this is some summary plots of those and here I have the mean surface Island temperature according to a liquid and you see that increase as we increase of liquidity um but this is to summarize that Dural temperature ranges plot and it's you can see that Spike at 15 degrees of liquid but you also can notice a dip at 45Â° and that is because at 45 degrees we're getting the most even distribution of Stellar radiation through the out the year so that means we're not getting as much fluctuations in temperature as we could see in other scenarios so this is the precipitation version of that lat long plot I showed you for temperature so um in the obliquity 15 you can kind of see the familiar cycle of having the intertropical Convergence Zone esque precipitation band along the Equator and then a little bit of decreasing precipitation um and that's akin to the horse latitudes we have here on Earth um and all that's all arising from like the highly cell and our normal atmospheric circulation that we're used to and that structure begins to break down as obliquity increases and actually after we reach 45 degrees obliquity we start transferring heat instead of from the equ to the pole to the from the pole to the Equator so you can see that kind of inversing of structure happening in 6075 and 90 degrees of liquidity um and you can also see that shift in this mean precipitation plot across Islands um in that the lower latitudes the lower obliquities have a very spiky structure to simulate that um multiple cellular um multiple cells in the atmosphere but as we get to higher obliquity we have a kind of evening out and it's not as severe um for the dial precipitation ranges um it's very interesting to note that all obliquities have a spike in precipitation ranges at the equator and that's because at lower latitudes for low obliquity scenarios we have very intense day night um breezes so that means that we're having very intense um cycles of precipitation and evaporation and then for high obliquity scenarios we also have that Peak because those low latitude islands are in between a pole that is having a very severe summer and a pole that is having a very severe winter leading to a lot of convection and increased precipitation so these are the summar plots for that um you can see the uh mean precipitation actually and the dial precipitation ranges both Peak at 45 degrees of liquid um and this is due to the same reason why we saw a dip in the um mean temperature ranges at the same point of that we have the most even distribution of Cellar radiation happening and since we have a warm climate on an ocean basically all ocean planet these islands are very small we have a lot of precipitation being generated year round because we have the most amount of area being evenly um irradiated and so it's really great to look at how liquidy affects precipitation on a day scale on a yearly scale and surface temperature but it's very important to not just try and apply um connect what we see here with the planetary Concepts that I have done so today um if we're interested in seeing what planetary scenarios actually promote a origin of life um it's important instead to apply um chemistry and so what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be covering a wide range of planetary features um with exoplasm and then I am going to be running a Pond model to simulate a warm little Pawn on each planetary scenario that is going to keep track of the supposed RNA synthesis that might occur and we are going to be using that to um identify which planetary scenarios might be the most conducive to An Origin of life that is it question okay we have uh couple minutes uh or actually several minutes for questions so here you go hey great talk um it's Bryce Tron con um Dartmouth um I was just wondering so how are you going to take in account basically your habitable zone um of each star type and then the so the distance from star of like affecting the maybe it's tially locked um or if you have like a yeah like I guess like ice Surface versus liquid surface and if like have a substellar pond versus global ice climate so yeah um this is actually the full parameter space that I'm going to be exploring um and it does include both G stars and M stars and for the mstar um planets we are not exploring obliquity because we are expecting them to experience tidy locked um scenarios as for um assuming that the planets are in the habitable zone we are assuming that the planets have surface liquid water and we can place volcanic islands on them so that is going to um affect where we think the planets are in relation to their star hi good Tu um Sam nasaline University of Arizona so yeah following following up on what the previous question have you looked at tidally locked planets and how that might affect wet dry cycles and I guess I have a second question um are there scenarios in which um the cycling is you know too rapid for example and that actually might lead to a reduction in the probability of of an origin of a life event yeah so we're definitely thinking about mstars um it's going to have a drastic effect on wet dry cycling because you don't have that day night cycling so it's going to be a little bit more like the 90 degree obliquity scenario um and we think that that's going to definitely just affect the whole thing as for um two frequent of cycling we're Alo also interested in seeing if like if we have like a big storm happen on our Island that we're looking at and it's like really severe we could have all of our evolutionary progress like flushed out um along with that like if it's too dry for too long then we could have too much exposure to UV or we could lose something to seage like we're trying to like also incorporate the strength and um some wind data into that so yeah um hi Lily Robin Thal uh University of Arizona really cool talk really neat stuff um I'm curious if you know if there are any sort of parallel studies going on investigating like urity in terms of other origin of Life scenarios other than what dry cycling um and if yall are kind of collaborating on on other possibilities in terms of origin of life as far as I know no one's using exop um exoplasm or like really looking at um gcms to do that um I do know a lot of different people are very fond of different um original life scenarios and so um I what I've told people is that I am generating a data set of um different obliquities different rotation rates and all of that that can be used for multiple scenarios the only thing is that if you wanted to investigate like hydrothermal vents you would have to use a model with a dynamic ocean like Rocky 3D um so I am not in contact with people doing that but I'm very interested in being contact with people doing that hi um run from University of Arizona so I was just wondering like to what extent you know the atmospheric composition of a planet that is either tightly locked or not tightly locked would you know alter the uh the results that you see so yeah um that's going to greatly affect basically everything for this we're assuming an earthlike Planet so we're just using like a modern Earth atmosphere or um early Earth atmosphere um and it's going to affect everything because the atmosphere is a big place where we get ingredients for life so we have lightning chemistry we have chemistry happening when we have metas coming and impacting even when they impact the plume can create Organics for life to occur so that would greatly affect how we would think that the chemistry is for example for the pond model that would greatly impact how we're tracting the chemistry or how we're even thinking that it would be urable at all any other questions um so how do you justify like the star and water content of the your system and oh dang I have one more right I don't think I'll come back okay um and like oh yeah there you go yeah and uh stripping of the atmosphere so yeah yeah um so right now we are just running with this Global ocean thing and that is because we think that it is possible for other planets to experience the same um ocean accumulation that we have on Earth because we're we're really only thinking about earthlike planets there's so many different type of exoplanets out there that could have so many different types of yourability that I am very interested in investigating but currently we're just looking at um an earthlike scenario because Earth is the only example we have of an abiogenesis occurring any other questions all right give Haley another round of applause okay and that concludes our um last session um and there is lunch not yet I mean we can wait in here if you want lunch will be here soon but it's not here yet so people can be chill relax c yeah so we've got an hour um next for the next session just make sure you're here like five minutes early so we could just start right on time also if you're in the next session giving a talk um please come up and see me I just want to make sure your slides are all good to go e [Music]

framework for understanding the origin and fate of Earth scarpin and you should clap extra hard for Justin because he's one of our organizers and he's done a lot for this [Applause] [Music] event all right can you hear me y cool well hello everybody my name is Justin Park I'm a PhD candidate at rener Poly Technic Institute in Troy New York about 3 hours East of here so pretty close um so I am interested in our lab in investigating volatile evolution of the earth uh so today I'm interested in telling you about a framework for the understanding of the origin and fate of Earth's carbon so why study carbon well hot take carbon is important for life and this is true from the molecular level all the way to cells and then we can get into complex life such as my dog Lincoln the use of the term complex is often debated now carbon is also important in driving planetary climate systems so on Earth we see evidence of a global carbon silicate cycle here we have carbon exchange to the atmosphere ocean crust and mantle and this exchange is promoting the climate of the planet through billion year time scales we anticipate that this or a similar type of cycle could exist on other exoplanets and we can Envision that the climate may be maintained and possibly the habitability of the planet maintained because of carbon so let's look at the Earth's carbon where is it well the carbon that we can observe is mostly trapped in the crust or the mantle we call this the bulk silicate Earth there is a lot of debate about how much carbon is trapped in these reservoirs but in general there's consensus that it's anywhere from four to six orders of magnitude larger than the ocean the atmosphere and the biosphere so that's a lot of carbon now we can distinguish between these carbon reservoirs using their carbon isotope ratios now we use the Delta notation this allows us to compare the ratio of carbon 13 to 12 and reference it to a standard now a more negative Delta value implies that the carbon isotope ratio is lower or the carbon is lighter so here on the right I have the Delta value plotted Against Time for marine carbonates diamonds and organic matter and this is plotted for the last 3 and a half billion years now one thing that's really curious is that this carbon and all these reservoirs show an isotopic signature that hasn't really changed over this time thus the Earth's carbon reservoirs have likely been set isotopically for most of Earth's history importantly what this tells us is that the bulk silicate Earth has a carbonized taope ratio around  5 per mil and it's been that way for at least three and a half billion years probably more how does Earth's carbon compared to carbon in the solar system well the bulk silicate Earth has a you know roughly 0.01 to 0.02 weight per carbon that's the amount of carbon per kilogram of material this is actually a lot lower than other things we see in the solar system such as the sun bites or comets now another interesting observation this carbon seems to be isotopically heavier than most things we find in the solar system the Earth the bulk silicate Earth has a Delta value of5 per mil whereas everything else except maybe comets has a lower and lighter carbon isotope ratio so if Earth's carbon is heavier and it contains less carbon per kilogram than the material that it might have formed from then that carbon must have left the Earth and that light carbon or it is either hidden in the Earth somewhere the formatting got a little screwed up uh so one thing I didn't reference is the Earth's core we think that the Earth's core could have a substantial amount of carbon for a couple of reasons now the first observation previous um Studies have suggested is that carbon is a highly siderophile element it likes to be in metal melts so because of this there's a hypothesized up to 10 to the 23r kilg of carbon trapped in the core at relevant temperature and pressure conditions a second observation is that from seismic data we can see the core is roughly 10% less dense than what we expected to be based on an iron and nickel mixture so this suggests there may be other Light Elements trapped in the core we could have hydrogen oxygen sulfur maybe nitrogen or carbon uh so because of this density deficit we're looking at specific phases to see what might you know cause this iron carbides seem to have a a good density to uh investigate this specifically with these estimates they predict anywhere from .5 to 4 * 10 22 kilogram so to put this into reference this is anywhere from 90 to 99% of the Earth's carbon trapped in the core based on these estimates that's a lot of carbon so we can't sample the Earth's core it's a little too far down but we can sample cores of other differentiated bodies in the solar system here we can look at iron meteorites now iron meteorites despite being iron have a lot of carbon in them and this carbon comes in different phases there's carbon in graphite nodules like this there's also carbon trapped in the metal phases themselves such as tanite and coite down here now this carbon would have been sourced from the overlying silica from the planetary embryo so we can look at that carbon and see is it fractionated between these phases the carbon in the graphite likely contains the same isotope ratio from the silica they precipitate in equilibrium this has an isotope ratio around 8 to5 per mil now the carbon in the metal is slightly different this is an isotope ratio of  22 to8 per mil so there is a fractionation what this is telling us is that the lighter carbon is preferentially stored in the metal phase this has really important implications for the Earth's core so we can compute a fractionation factor this is effectively the difference in Delta values between these phases for this iron meteorite it's around 13 now this fractionation Factor does have some theoretical backing here what I'm showing is the fractionation factor plotted against temperature on the x axis and this is for a variety of different phases and expected carbon compounds in the mantle equilibrating with iron carbide now one thing to note here is there is a temperature dependence as the temperature gets higher and higher there is less fractionation that's expected importantly though every single one of these fractionations is below zero so regardless of the temperature regardless of the phase this tells us the iron phase will have a lot more light carbon so we can use this to kind of study maybe the Earth's core formation we know Iron meteorites probably differentiated at a lower temperature thus their fractionation is a lot uh higher or greater magnitude but we also know that the Earth's core likely formed around 2200 to 3200 de Celsius that means we should get significantly less fractionation and we expect between  1 and 4 per mil fractionation for the earth now if we want to model this we need to look at the Earth in the early stages of its Evolution specifically the magma ocean in the magma ocean there would have been M Metal droplets that are swirling around and equilibrating with the silic and you know kind of consuming and absorbing up carbon these metal droplets would eventually accumulate at the silica solidus and as you know metal is denser than silic they would release a instability and travel into the core through these large diapers so incrementally the core is built but also incrementally we're adding carbon to the core through these diars we can model this a little bit further at time at TD that's when differentiation begins we start to see carbon is uh released from the mantle and brought to the core TD finish is when we see um differentiation ends and we have these set conditions we observe today so the mantle carbon decreases core carbon increases but the total Carbon on Earth doesn't change at all we can look at the isotope ratios and see something as well uh as we begin here the isotopically light carbon will be transported into the core due to mass balance this will start to make the mantle heavier and heavier and as that material is transitioned back into the core we're going to start to get the core heavier and heavier again so this blue line here is what we observe in the bulk silicate Earth a value of5 per mil this modeling implies that the carbon that the Earth formed from and the carbon in the core are isotopically lighter than what we observe today modeling this a little bit more thoroughly we can use a ra fractionation to explain these results now on the y  AIS here I have the percent of Earth's carbon in the core versus the isotope ratio of potential materials that gave Earth its carbon one thing to note there is an absolute limit here we cannot go above ne5 per mil that's because our fractionation is always negative now because of this we can also look and see how many steps it might take to deliver that carbon to the core with ultra light material say solar carbon it takes a lot more steps to deliver core carbon and we get you know a lot more carbon in the core upwards of 95 to 99% so in total Earth's starting iope ratio has to be less than the bulk silicate Earth here we can also model the temperature dependence of this here I have plotted the percent of carbon in the core versus the fractionation factor and this is temperature dependent remember the fractionation is reduced as we increase in temperature as both of those happen we get more carbon into the core as more steps are necessary to reach the observed isotope ratios we have today so we can model this in three dimensional space as there is potentially infinite combinations of fractionation factors and starting materials that's what I've done here again the xaxis is the starting isotope ratio the Y is the fractionation factor and Z is the percent carbon in the core the red lines here represent isobars of equal carbon concentration in the core uh and I've plotted for reference some of the starting materials such as solar carbon or kritic carbon we only care about a small window of this for the Earth so we can look in this range uh this is appropriate temperature pressure conditions and then we can add relevant reference materials that the Earth might have started with now on this right plot here I have again the Y the carbon content in the core left axis is in kilogram right Axis in percent and the xaxis is the Delta 13 C of the starting material each star represents an individually um distinguished starting material such as cratic material solar carbon or a mix of both we can start to use this to differentiate which material might be useful and form the early Earth we know that the Earth has a mass and it's you know below what we see the carbon content of the solar um experiment should be so we can Ru this and say it's not going to happen we can also look at the other um experimental techniques of investigating carbon in the core and we see that the contic material is plotting right within this range so finding one we suggest that based on iope ratios the core should contain the majority of the Earth's carbon we also suggest that this is likely a a mechanism for identifying kritic material as the formation of Earth's carbon we can kind of flip this on its end and investigate the bulk carbon contents of the the iron meteorite and their parent bodies uh we can look at the fractionation factor we have plotted up here and we can predict that the carbon trapped in these bulk embryos might be roughly 2/3 in the core and the remainder in the rest of the silica so we can do a kind of meteorite forensics so there is a fun thing that can happen and complicate this uh any carbon delivery after core formation will require additional mass balance we have evidence that there are siderophile elements in the mantle that aren't in the core and this tells us that there have been some delivery elements after this uh a possible explanation for this is through a late veneer which could have delivered carbon from 0 to 50% of what we observe in the bulk silicate Earth so adding to our model here if carbon is added following differentiation it'll only be in the mantle shown here it won't increase the carbon in the core and then it will increase the total Earth's carbon Reservoir we can model this isotopically and the late veneer likely was kritic so it's supplying lighter carbon sources than the bulk silicate Earth and kind of counterintuitively this implies more carbon would be in the core as there is a mass balance now where this step here is a heavier carbon than what we observe today so more steps are necessary to get that carbon in the core now what you're about to see is a model um where we incorporate that to kind of characterize all of the possible amounts of carbon delivered through aate veneer we animated this um adding on the right now we have a plot of core content versus the fraction of the bulk silk at Earth carbon delivered following differentiation so in this model you or in this animation you can see that the carbon contents are increasing as we add more carbon following the late veneer now this is telling us that these starting materials might be good if there is no late veneer but if we have a late veneer to a certain degree they will eventually promote too much carbon in the core or imply too much carbon in the core to the point where they are no longer acceptable starting materials I'm going to play this one more time this time let's focus on this boundary here when we look at this we can see it's expanding towards the right that means the earlier um materials forming the Earth could have been heavier with their carbon isotope ratio this implies that we could have a mix of kritic or cometary matter forming the Earth's carbon reservoirs so with this a kritic late veneer implies that more carbon can be trapped in the Earth's core we have shown this through the animation um we also know based on reasonable bounds of our late veneer that these are still consistent with what we're observing in solubility and density estimates that's this region right here a third finding is that the late veneer allows for the earliest sources of carbon to the Earth to be heavier than the bulk silicate Earth that we have now so this is higher than the five per mil value that's illustrated by this blue curve here that could be um this five per mil so with this we can get a preferred solution with a roughly condic starting material material a Delta value of  15 plus or minus 2 and roughly 15 to 25% of the Earth's bulk silicate carbon delivered in this slate veneer we predict that the carbon content in the core would be anywhere from 1 to 2 * 10 the 22nd kilograms that's again a lot of carbon but to put that in reference it's 95 to 99% of the Earth's carbon trapped in the core so in summary the isotope mass balance framework that we've developed here it's allowing us to extrapolate what the sources of Earth carbon could have been and how much of that carbon could have ended up in the core we find that the most likely source of this is kritic material and then in the carbon in the core could account for 95 to 99% of the planet's carbon we've shown that this can be applied to other differentiated bodies in the solar system we can do a sort of meteorite forensics investigating the bulk carbon content throughout the solar system and finally this proves that most of the Earth's carbon is not available to life um this is pretty powerful as this carbon you know wouldn't be there for the origin of Life the evolution of life or any Associated chemistries it's important to think about this in a planetary context because this implies that life found a way even though it seems the odds are stacked against it uh with that I'd like to thank you all for listening I'd like to give a shout out to everyone back home at RPI um and a quick thank you to our funding the Earth first or Earth first origins project from NASA thank you very much hi great talk uh do you suppose that the late vire mechanism that brought a lot of carbon to Earth Earth is uh sort of normal for our solar system and can you speculate perhaps if if there's a Time components to the availability of of carbon to sort of help with the U AOG Genesis yeah uh so the idea of the late veneer um we find evidence for it both on Earth the moon and on Mars um the general idea is having some form of differentiation occurring first and you still have these impactors uh hitting the Earth Mars the moon this will add material to your planet um far after the time period of when you know you should have carbon abundant in your silicate mantle um sorry what was the the second question as well oh yes the contribution of this slate V carbon to to abiogenesis gotcha uh so if we look at the carbon resir on the earth um a lot of what we see could have been delivered following core formation um depending on that X variable how much carbon is present that would be carbon that could all be usable by um life organisms this could imply that the majority of Earth's carbon was delivered in a late veneer um if that's the case then that might say that carbon is available to life there's not really a way to distinguish Now using just these isotope ratios how early this process happened this is just summarizing how much carbon content has been delivered to the Earth following core differentiation um so for the origin of Life studies and abiogenesis it it's still a little unclear based on isope ratios um but at least certainly before three and a half billion years ago there would have been a carbon Reservoir that you know had the appropriate contents hey Justin um so really cool talk by the way um would this be an earth specific thing or would you expect this on any rocky planet and if so how would that impact the search for potential bio signatures on other rocky planets I definitely don't think this is an earth specific thing however it could be a size dependent thing uh Mars is a lot smaller than the earth and it's expected to have formed a lot quicker um so the actual magnitude of carbon that's trapped in the Martian core could be very different than what we observe on the earth core uh further with that the you know time scale Mars took to form is significantly shorter than the earth so the kritic material that might have been delivered could represent a much larger portion of the planet's carbon um speaking specifically to the evolution of Life anywhere it seems if you have a lot more carbon being delivered um later you could have saying for Mars that carbon would be more readily available to the organisms that could Thrive there so if you have a a kind of mass dependence here the smaller planets might have a lot more carbon available to them from kritic Material larger planets might have more carbon um or less carbon available following core differentiation does that answer your question we have time for one more hi Satish from un of Naples I just want to check with regards to um the ion meteorite references and like the kratic ones that you've used in the visualization or by the way cool visualizations are they the same or sorry cuz I here you used um the Stony sorry the ion metor as a proxy M and then later when it comes to the models and stuff are looking at kratic ones are you looking at iron Stony meteorites just to GL oh are they different no so the the carbon sources that we use in the model are generalized the isotope ratios that are trapped in these meteorites they range anywhere from  5 to  30 so I was trying to put up a range of potential kritic materials uh these iron meteorites don't really deliver a lot of carbon we think to the planet uh we think it's probably the more um basic level meteorites that aren't differentiated so our carbonaceous condres that kind of stuff delivering specific carbon nutrients to the planet cool all right and next we'll welcome Sam prior also from RPI and she'll be giving a talk on enhanced phoso deer my new word of the day Bond formation in abiotic RNA polymerization via a cycled mic droplet synthesis setup it's a tongue twist you tell me not [Music] yet that is the end of my talk um if you just click one and then enter it should take you to the first one close your eyes no spoilers okay cool this is the beginning slide hi everybody can you all hear me all right cool all right I'm Sam pry thirdy year grad student in the department of Earth and environmental science at RPI I'm working with Dr Jake Shelly and the rare Center um focusing on origins of life and Prebiotic chemistry specifically I'm interested in micro droplets as a sort of unique reaction environment focusing on how they can impact um RNA larization or phosphodiester Bond formation uh but before we get too much into what I'm doing I wanted to provide a quick primer for preotic chemistry most of you probably already know about Prebiotic chemistry at this point but I thought it better safe than sorry we'll have a quick uh review here so I like to think of chemical or Prebiotic chemistry as a sort of chemical Evolution scale with um molecular complexity going from least complex to most complex here so we would have started with the inorganics present from Earth's formation like all that carbon that Justin just told us about this uh these inorganics would have undergone geochemical processes to eventually form simple Organics uh then increasingly complex Organics until we get to the building blocks of life that we all know and love like amino acids uh sugars and our nuclear bases sides and ties these building blocks would then undergo condensation reactions uh and form some sort of biopolymers so you know we have our lipids that we've heard all about today nucleic acids that we've heard about and proteins that we've heard all about these guys would then somehow form the earliest life now I know we're probably not all chemistry uh minded here but there's a really really wide range of different chemistries here uh and I'm just one grad student so I'm only going to focus on one little chunk of this uh the transition from building blocks of polymers which as I mentioned is mostly facilitated via condensation reactions but to get some more context for our Prebiotic chemistry we need to First think about um chemistry in the context of environments specifically Earth's environment since we're interested in the origin of life so we have the Proto Earth over here that was going to or that was likely hit by a large impactor called Thea crash boom bang we get a bunch of stuff happening uh and then eventually we settle into the Earth which has all the material that you know makes up the modern Earth and the moon now it's important to note that this um hian Earth would be very different from the earth as we know it I mean you know environmental conditions are going to be very different but maybe not as different as we think so if we think about the hian Earth in terms of geologic time scales since we're interested in the origins of life we're interested in this sort of earliest chunk of Earth's history over here the hian the Aran really early on about 100 million years after the Earth's formation or the moon forming impact rather uh recent evidence suggests that uh shallow water oceans could have formed so Justin was telling us all about the magma ocean and differentiation so relatively quickly on the geologic scale we could have had uh water Global Water oceans pretty quickly and with the formation of water oceans we get micr droplets which are Micron diameter sized water drop droplets that are going to be abundant anywhere where there's water on the Earth's surface this is because they form by wind and wave action so in this figure down here we see micr droplets being formed from a crashing wave say in the ocean conversely we also get bubbles that get trapped under the surface of the the water here that are going to provide even more environments for the interesting chemistry that we can also see in micr droplets so we get micr droplets we get micro bubbles but importantly this stuff doesn't just happen over the ocean it can also happen over Lakes uh it can happen as a result of Hot Springs Geyers or any sort of you know violent things maybe like impactors crashed into the ocean or a lake can kick up micro droplets or even like clouds you know we all know and love clouds um so you can get condensation on nuclei in the atmosphere that can also give micr droplets so they're going to be really really really abundant anywhere anytime you have water on the earth's surface in addition to being really abundant they provide some really unique uh chemical properties mostly due to the partial solvation State available to reactants at the interface so if we were to plot a reaction progress diagram for this reactant partial salvation State we see uh reaction rates that are more akin to gas phase reaction rates than they are to liquid phase reaction rates however our uh density of our reactants is higher than the gas phase it's more more like the liquid phase so that partial salvation state is going to kind of give us like The Best of Both Worlds between gas phase and liquid phase chemistry so I mentioned before I'm just one grad student I'm focusing on one very small section of Prebiotic chemistry specifically condensation reactions um I decided to look at RNA formation because there's a wealth of literature on it mostly because of the RNA World hypothesis that we've kind of heard mentioned today um but condensation reactions including RNA formation are going to be really important step to increase molecular complexity however there are some issues with them occurring in box solution mostly because they have they um result in the production of a water molecule so if you have B solution and you have a reaction trying to proceed that's going to produce a lot of water it's not going to really want to go the uh reverse reaction hydrolysis is actually going to be preferred here um so I I should have said with nucleotide formation we get phoso diester Bond formation um but hydrolysis is going to be preferred in bulk so we need to come up with some way to sort of drive this reaction whether it's in bul or wet dry cycling or some other method now like I mentioned um this reaction has been studied since like the 1960s for Prebiotic chemistry so a lot of really smart organic chemists uh got together and came up with a lot of ways to drive this reaction in bulk my personal favorite is um using preactivated nucleotides so if you take an aidasol Group which we have over here and just kind of slap it onto the phosphate there you're going to get um um your reaction to proceed because amidol is a really good leaving group so as soon as you get your preactivated nucleotide in solution that amidol it's ready to go and as the amol leaves you can get the energy that you need for phosphodiester Bond formation so with our preactivated nucleotides we're going to get a lion nucleotide formation in bu solution um this you know scientist came up with this around like the 1960s 1970s so this reaction's been around for a while so there's a lot of literature on it which makes it a really good reaction to study I should mention um adenine is typically the nuclear base used because it is the easiest to Alize um some of the other nucleo bases have uh some unique experimental difficulties with alization but this reaction since it's been studied for so long makes it a sort of like a model condensation reaction to look at in micr droplets so we're going to take our reaction we're going to put it in micr droplets and we're going to see can micr droplet chemistry impact RNA formation but really what we're getting at here is where is the reaction actually occurring in the droplet and we sort of have two options here one that the reaction is occurring at the surface of the droplet where we can get that partial solvation State available to the reactants where so we can drive this really unique chemistry and if the reaction is occurring at the droplet interface we would expect some sort of enhanced RNA igamer formation or some sort of enhancement uh in our aligon nucleotide formation however the reaction could also be occurring towards the interior of the droplet where it's mostly just bulk so you wouldn't really expect any difference between your bul controls and your um micro droplet reactions so I uh got at this in the lab I'm an experimentalist so um I designed some experiments to see to to test my hypothesis here I use two separate independent uh nebulizers here to make my micro droplets over here on the left we have an ultrasonic nebulizer and over here on the right we have a vibrating Orphus aerosol generator or vag it's really important to use two independent nebulization techniques um because they're going to make droplets in different ways so you can compare your results between the two nebulizers and see if it's a nebulization dependent effects or if it's actually a result of the micr dropic chemistry which is the heart of the question that we're trying to get at here uh importantly both nebulizers produce droplets that are a similar size range so that shouldn't impact the chemistry too much um I will note ultrasonic nebulizer is the preferred nebulizer because it is much easier to use um this one kind of heats up and shuts itself off every 25 minutes which is super fun to deal with in the lab um also this one is more robust I can run it 247 for potentially weeks on end um so I'm going to walk you through how I set up an experiment I take both nebulizers I have my solution phase with my preactivated nucleotides sometimes with the salt depending on what sort of environments I'm trying to mimic turn on the nebulizer and make droplets and then I collect them either in a spray chamber over here with the ultrasonic nebulizer or my super duper high tech product Reservoir here that is a 50m falcon tube slapped on the end um then I collect the condensate and cycle it back into the Sol trans to get this sort of natural cycling between the bulk phase and the micropet phase which is going to mimic what we see in you know the cycling that we see in the ocean but also geyser's Hot Springs uh lakes and clouds so really the overall goal is is trying to see how our chemistry see if we can better mimic um natural environments in the lab to really get at the heart of um our research question um to analyze my samples I use Matrix assisted laser dsorption ionization time oflight mass spectrometry or mof Ms or just MDI um and this provides data that looks like this so we have signal on the y  AIS as a function of Mass to charge ratio on the x axis sort of just a standard Mass spec um importantly all of these Peaks that you see here are ligr Peaks so we have everywhere from a dimer up to a sevener and I mostly look at this highest peak so the maximum detected igamer length for each Spectrum so I collect those for all of my experiments at different time points throughout the experiment to get some sort of like quasi kinetic data and then I average all of that and I get a plot that looks sort of like this so we have average maximum igamer length on the y  axis versus the function of time on the x axis so here I'm looking at just pure water with pure water with our preactivated nucleotides and solution and we get some really interesting results we see that microdroplets are impacting RNA larization if we look at the shortest time points we see that the longest iggers um that are formed in micr droplets form very quickly so within an hour um we make the longest uh iggers that we see in droplets in just pure water with no additives if we look at our later time points we see that um so after 3 days micr drop produced igers are about three times longer than those seen in bul these results are sort of unprecedented um for just pure reactions with no additional Catalyst or intermediates or anything typically in BO solution you'll get maybe dimers or triers but we see that with u micro droplet formation alone we get a potentially three times increase in algr length however when we add salts to sort of mimic that ocean environment our data gets a little bit more nuanced so you can see at later time points the bulk is actually going to produce longer igers it takes longer for our bulk reaction to get to equilibrium so you know um iggers in bul with calcium chloride which is the salt I'm using can regularly be like 10 nucleotides in length um at like at later time points but we don't see iggers that long in micr droplets however if we look at earlier time points we're seeing that micr droplets are actually producing longer igamer faster than bulk solution so this is implying some sort of kinetic rate enhancement of micr droplet formation so if we zoom into that short of the shorter time scales um we can see once again the longest igers that occur in micr droplets occur very quickly so here within two hours in the presence of salts so even with salts microdroplet formation is doing something you know it's still enhancing RNA lization it's just at shorter time scales and we're not seeing humors as long at later time scales when we compare data from both of our nebulizers to sort of verify that the trends that we're seeing are as a result of micro droplets and not the specific nebulization Technique we see similar Trends so once again the longest igers that are occurring in micro droplets occur very quickly for two hours within two hours for the ultrasonic nebulizer or within four hours for the vag whereas if we look at the bul solution phase we see comparable length olgers are only formed after 6 hours or longer which indicat Ates that micr droplets once again are doing something independent of nebulizer type even in the presence of salts so in summary micr droplets are really common ubiquitous reaction environments they're prebiotically plausible they're going to be around as long as you have water on a planet surface it doesn't even have to be Earth um and they're really unique reaction spaces that haven't been explored very much for preotic chemistry uh here I showed that microdroplets do in fact enhance RNA lization with uh a liger for forming very rapidly in droplets importantly we found that even in just pure water micro droplets with no additional additives we get um up to three times length enhancement compared to ball controls for our ligers uh and all of these data suggest that the reaction is likely occurring at the droplet surface with the partial salvation State playing a role in the reaction kinetics future work hopes to explore alternate nuclear bases in addition to adamine um we want to look at varied salt concentration and composition to see if that impacts RNA larization and then we also want to investigate alternate leaving groups so in addition to amidol to see how that might impact how or where the reaction occurs in droplets so with that I'd like to thank everyone back home at RPI um thank all of you thank the organizers and I'll take [Applause] questions boy H hello um maybe I missed that could you tell me what the concentration you're using for this alization um thing and what buffer you're using and the second question is that um for your system uh for like you when you're using nubiz and like recycle your solution um what's the what's like the container is is that like made of a glass or something sure so to answer your first question I'm using 15 Millar for my preactivated nucleotides and one molar salt concentration um what was the second part of your first question uh what's it what's a buffer you're using I'm not using a buffer so um I'm trying to make it as simple of a system as possible just to see if micr droplets have any impact um um the second is that um when youing stuff what was um so for the ultrasonic nebulizer it's a glass spray chamber um for the other one it's some sort of plastic um I'm not sure this specific plastic composition uh like what I'm seeing for my experiments cuz I using radiation so I can tell if I'm using glasswar um it will stick on the surface okay so we'll do some is that possible your stuff is sticking on the surface or like do you use like stuff to you know prevent that from hem no it definitely could be possible um since I'm looking at the condensate the way the spray chamber is designed it's it's meant to sort of collect all the condensate and it'll funnel down so it's like the reaction is always or the the solution is always cycling through so I wouldn't expect anything to get stuck to the spray chamber and stay there um yeah I wouldn't expect it to but that would be an interesting thing to kind of check out thank you thank you thank you for that yeah hi um Alex Dean R uh Georgia Tech um I'm curious uh how generalizable you think uh the uh kinetic effects of the uh the uh partial solvation interface might be to like uh other potentially prebiotically relevant reactions like uh oligopeptide synthesis or depsipeptide synthesis great question so it is very reaction dependent so um you can't really generalize the specific reaction rate enhancement that I'm seeing I know there has been previous work um by some other people looking at um peptide formation in droplets specifically but for other sort of reaction classes is still largely unexplored thank you yeah thank you hi super cool talk this was really great um hi pcia medva from ASU um I had a really similar question but on the other axis I was curious if you think um similar effects might be observed if the solvent is different so I was thinking about like uh the thins on Titan how you have these little aerosol droplets but you know it's not water right so yeah I was just curious if you had any thoughts about that absolutely it would play a role so really um what's going to drive a lot of the like Surface versus B chemistry in the droplet is going to be hydrophobicity of your reactants so if you're changing your solvent the hydrophobicity of it's not wouldn't be hydrophobicity anymore right it's going to depend on the chemical properties of your species of Interest interacting with your solvents that's a great question and yes it will impact fact cool okay thank you so much yeah no problem hey Sam good talk super interesting uh Abby daring Georgia Tech I was wondering you talked about the reaction happening at the droplet surface versus the interior um did you I I maybe I missed it but how are you determining whether or not it's happening at the surface or the interface yeah or no the interface or the interior so I'm running B I didn't mention uh I am running B controls with all of these um so B basically it really comes down to this if I see an enhancement in the solution that underwent micr droplet formation then I'm assuming that it's as a result of something happening at the droplet surface because if the reaction was just happening all in the bulk phase you're not going to get any of those reaction enhancements you would expect very similar so in in the data over here hold on zoom in in the data over here you would expect instead of being up here the the you know Alum Rel length would be down here s more much more similar to what we would see in the ball controls that makes a lot of sense thank you thank you hi oh yeah hi really cool talk um Juliana dejo Georgia Tech um so my question was kind of about you know in your experiments um you were seeing reactions on the time scales of hours into like up to days um and just this is more on the feasibility of uh droplets in on the Prebiotic earth like what did you think like do those longer time scales kind of become less feasible in terms of a lifetime for like a droplet to be um you know before it like re enters into bulk Solution that's a great question that um droplets are going to have a resonance time in the atmosphere that's largely dependent on their size so for small droplets like what I'm looking at you know in the tens of microns or less you know it's going to depend on air currents and stuff like that but it's not out of reason for them to be in the atmosphere for days to weeks maybe even years if they're really small um you can also get some really interesting things that happen like your droplets can go up all the solvent can evaporate and you can be left with a particle that can then get rehydrated if it goes into a more humid sort of environment so longer time scales could be feasible but shorter time scales are also feasible for droplets which is part of the beauty of them thank you just a quick question might have missed it so in like this plot here in the bulk is that just in like a test tube or a beaker yep just in a microen tube the bench so why could the I guess the why couldn't the reaction take place in inside the micro droplets if the concentration is like increase greatly could you repeat that why can't why can't the reaction happen inside the micro droplets versus on sure so if the reaction was happening at the interior of the droplets you're not going to get that partial salvation State playing a role you would expect a similar you would expect results that are more like the bulk phase so it really comes down to like how much water is hanging around so at the surface there's less water so you're going to get differences okay in your reaction we can talk about it more later if you want I can explain it better later okay cool I think I'm probably running out of time thanks all right and welcome Rohan he's going to tell us about photosynthetic bio signatures biogenetic oxygen production

have Michael W with a novel Institue bios signature technique based on pyro gcms and machine learning all right thanks yeah it's so great to be here at my first ABG gradon really excited to tell you a little bit about uh the work that I've been doing for the past couple of years at the uh Carnegie Institution of science where I'm a NASA Sean fellow uh so as we all know Planetary Exploration is embarking on a new golden age of astrobiology where numerous spacecraft missions will'll be tasked explicitly with trying to find evidence for habitability and life in our solar system we're uh in this Saga of a Mars sample return Mission Europa Clipper launches later this year dragonfly will visit Titan in the 2030s and as we heard about from Morgan cable we're thinking about future missions to Enceladus to try to understand whether or not there's life on that IC ocean world around Saturn so I think now is really the time to try to develop some really Cutting Edge bios signature detection techniques for solar system exploration for me any strong bios signature detection technique has four main attributes first it has to be robust which means immune to false positives and false negatives second agnostic which means it's capable of identifying Life as We Know It And also Life as we don't know it probabilistic which means that we can quantify our uh our our confidence in having detected or not detected alien life and finally flight ready which means it utilizes instrumentation that NASA Isa or some other space agency will actually strap onto the back of a rocket and launch into space in the near future so the BIOS signature technique that me and my colleagues have been developing at Carnegie seeks to satisfy all four of those Central criteria this is a robust agnostic bios signature technique based on machine learning and pyrolysis gcms we published the initial paper on uh this technique uh last year last September in pnas in a paper that was lead authored by my friend and colleague Dr Jim Cleaves so imagine for a second that you want to find life on Europa what are you going to do you're probably going to send a spacecraft to sample and characterize some of that surface material on this world this plume detrius that most likely originated in the habitable subsurface ocean below you might launch a uh an instrument called a pyrolysis gas chromatograph Mass spectrometer um basically uh what this is is is a very fancy oven that not only bakes your sample but tastes it for you too and these types of instruments are sent to all kinds of interplanetary destinations as we speak right now there's one sitting on the Curiosity Rover on the surface of Mars so the data that a pyrolysis gcms gather look like this on the x axis we have the Mass the charge ratio of various ions that are being counted by the detector as the sample heats up with temperature through time so the z axis on this plot is just the intensity the number of those molecules being counted per second at that particular mass of charge ratio at that particular temperature in the chamber now if you found something that looked like this on Europa I think you'd be very excited because this is what the average Earth bacterium looks like thing is about looking for life on an alien world is that there's no guarantee that it will use the exact same biochemistry as life on Earth so it might be naive to design your life detection experiment around oh you know trying to find that particular Peak or this particular molecule over here instead there might be something about the overall distribution of organic molecules in this sample that helps us determine whether or not it was alive or never alive and so what we've been doing at Carnegie is pyol izing and running through our gcms all kinds of organic Rich samples things that were very recently alive like bacteria and plant matter things that were once upon alive but over millions of years have been geologically processed into petroleum oil coal shell Etc and organic Rich samples that were never alive like carbonous condres and the results of Miller Yuri type origin of Life experiments now I hope that can appreciate just by I looking at these various distributions of organic molecules that the distribution of organic molecules in all of these samples are very different from one another and so when we saw this we wondered hey can we quantify how similar or different these distributions are from one another and also train a machine learning algorithm to tell the difference between a sample with biogenic Origins and a sample that was completely abiotic and so that's exactly what we did we trained what's called a random Forest algorithm on 134 diverse organic Rich samples and the final algorithm is able to tell the biogenicity of a sample that it's never seen before to an accuracy of about 90% which is absolutely astounding not only can it tell something that was alive versus not alive it can also distinguish between degraded and fresh biotic uh matter and so what you're looking at here in this plot are the first two of 20 principal components of our data you see the abiotic samples all cluster in this tight region over here with the biotic degraded sample sweeping up this way and the biotic fresh sample sweeping down here now you might be a little bit worried about the overlap in this region but remember these are just the first two of 20 principal components so if you imagine extending this graph into a third or fourth or fifth dimension these clouds of points will further segregate hence the 90% accuracy of our algorithm now it's really exciting for me as an astrobiologist is the potential to use this technique to look for what we call biological anomalies on other worlds so imagine you go to Europa Enceladus Mars Titan Etc and you find organic Rich samples that plot somewhere here or maybe out here uh they have organic distributions that are very different from all known abiotic samples and the organic distributions are also markedly different from the organic distributions in Life as we know it whether fresh or degraded I think if we saw something like this we might be looking at a potential biological anomaly of life using a very different biochemistry from Life as we know it here on Earth so with this technique there are two big Frontiers ahead of us the first obviously in astrobiology we now have this robust molecular technique of looking for life including the identification potentially of Life as we do not know it we also have this amazing opportunity in paleobiology for the past several decades you know paleobiologists have been at each other's throats about these ancient 3 to four billion year olds uh ancient archan churs or uh other ancient rocks that some groups say have traces of microfossils and other groups say no way and so maybe our machine learning technique will be able to shed some light using an independent line of evidence to try to understand the evolution of early life on our very own Planet okay so why fundamentally should the distribution of organic molecules in living samples be different from the distribution of organic molecules in non living samples answer this I want to make an analogy to statistical mechanics so imagine you have a hot cup of tea the micro state of that cup of tea will be given by the position and the moment of all the particles in that teacup and the uh the the number of micro states that correspond to a cold cup of tea in a room temperature room are vastly greater than the number of micro states that correspond to a hot cup of tea in a room temperature room and this is why gradually over time your hot teacup will cool down this is our second law of thermodynamics this is our Arrow of time so the analogy that I want to make to life is this maybe there is a high dimensional phase space not of position and momenta of particles but of molecular patterns that helps us differentiate between living samples and non living samples now the Curious Thing about life is that it seems to move evolve in the opposite direction of what the second law of Thermodynamics should say we have origins of Life non living worlds transform into into living worlds with global biospheres increasing seemingly the complexity of that world with time this seems very puzzling uh until you remember two crucial facts number one is that life is an open system able to uh you know exchange matter and energy and information with its environment and also that life responds to selection pressures in particular selection for function so we have a companion paper out also last year published in pnas uh that is titled on the role of function and selection and evolving systems that tries to get at the more theoretical nature of what might be going on here this is a paper that I'm absolutely proud of because it represents more than two years of very intense discussions not just amongst the interdisciplinary group of scientists but also between scientists and philosophers of science so Carol Cleland for instance and Heather Demas these are professors of philosophy of science at the uh University of Colorado Colorado Boulder uh who really helped sharpen the idea is in this manuscript so the purpose of this paper was to try to introduce an explanatory framework for the evolution of physical systems WR large so including but not limited to biology the second law of Thermodynamics is the only time asymmetric law uh so far articulated in our scientific Canon but the second law does not explicitly address the tendency for evolving systems to become increasingly complex with time and so therefore a missing law of cosmic complexification if one does exist must be consistent with the second law of Thermodynamics but may not inevitably follow from it so we began our investigation by noting that all natural laws are built around conceptual equivalencies for instance Newton's law of gravity was built upon this property of having Mass this property is shared amongst a diverse uh group of phenomena whether it's an apple falling from a tree a planet orbiting a star even atoms and mole ules are governed to some extent by Newton's law of gravity by virtue of having Mass so the first question we had to ask ourselves is what are the conceptual equivalencies that underly all complex evolving systems for us Evolution occurs in any system that has three properties number one a large number of diverse interacting components two a way for those components to sample Myriad configurations and three selection for function let me give you a few examples to illustrate what I'm talking about so in nucleosynthesis our interacting components are protons and neutrons the ways the sample new configurations of them are through Stellar Fusion Supernova Stellar mergers and there's a selection for stability in Mineral Evolution our interacting components are at one level higher they are the elements of the periodic table and you sample new configurations of these elements through the various modes of mineral paragenesis as planets evolve they subject their materials to new pressure temperature composition regimes and again there's a selection for stability in biological evolution our interacting components are many and at many scales genes cells species you sample new configurations through mutations horizontal Gene transfer Rec combination Etc and there's a selection for survival and propagation at this juncture it was really important for me to try to address this question of what do we actually mean by selection for function in other words what are the most fundamental selection forces in nature what are the functions that the Universe quote unquote cares about and so in the paper we outline what we think are the three fundamental sources of selection namely static persistence which is simply the idea that configurations of matter will persist in time unless kinetically favorable Avenues exist for their incorporation into more stable configurations static persistence allows there to be out of equilibrium structures in the universe whose dissipation can drive the emergence of dynamic systems such as hurricanes convection cells fire even life and in these Dynamic systems processes might emerge which are defined as any process functions may emerge which is defined as any process that has causal efficacy over that system's Dynamic persistence and finally we think that there is a selection pressure for novelty generation why because the discovery of new functions that promote Dynamic persistence raises that system's quote unquote kinetic barrier against the K to equilibrium and we see novelty Generation all over life from the acceptation of one function to another or even the way that bacteria can tune their mutation rate such such that they mutate faster in more stressful environments and so finally given this functional view of evolving systems what might be an auspicious ontology for a law of increasing complexity here's where we turn to this idea of functional information which essentially quantifies the fraction of all possible configurations of a system that possess a certain degree of function so here you have your entire configuration space some of those configurations can perform a specific function the functional information of the system is defined simply as the negative log base 2 of that fraction of configurations that can perform the function given this definition of functional information why would the functional information of Any Given system change over time there are two main reasons why it might change over time you might have an expansion of your configuration space or strengthening of selection pressures and to illustrate this let me turn to an example from the abiotic World mineral Evolution so in Mineral Evolution we have a configuration space expansion due to the ever increasing diversity and availability of Elemental components that can comprise minerals as well as the idea that planetary environments will continuously sample new pressure temperature and composition spaces as they evolve we also have strengthening selection pressures in that there's an ever increasing time between crystallization of Any Given mineral in the present and the fact that new minerals arise by modification of the prior generation of minerals and in a new paper that we uh have recently submitted and is under review currently we've actually Quantified the functional information in Mineral evolution showing that there is a monotonic increase in the functional information of mineral systems from the first minerals that were born in Stellar atmospheres early on in the universe all the way through the minerals that are associated with ignas and metamorphic processes associated with plate tectonics on Earth uh and so uh we're proposing emphasis on the word proposing a new natural law the law of increasing functional information which simply states that the functional information of a system will increase that is the system will evolve if many different configurations of the system are subjected to selection for one or more functions what are the implications of a natural law such as this well there are many I'm just going to highlight two to wrap up this presentation number one is that we can see darwinian Evolution as a special case of a much more General phenomenon of evolution RIT large that can be applied to all kinds of physical and chemical systems including mineral Evolution also to tie us back to the first half of this talk there may be a distinction between life and non life that is related to selection for function and maybe the reason why the machine learning algorithm that we've developed is so good at uh detecting the difference between life and non life is because the organic molecules in life have been sculpted by selection for Myriad biochemical functions whereas the Organics that we find in say meteorites have only been sculpted by selection for static persistence and so to wrap up the take home messages today I hope you've been excited by this new bio signature technique based based on pyrolysis gcms combined with machine learning that achieves 90% accuracy in uh distinguishing biotic from abiotic samples and I hope your minds have been tickled if not expanded by this proposition for a new natural law based around increasing functional information in complex evolving systems thank you very much and I'd be happy to take your questions we have three or four minutes for questions hi this is a super cool talk I'm so excited I want to like talk to you after as well um hi paa media from Arizona State um okay so so you know you've trained this learning algorithm to be able to identify these different samples and you know biotic and abiotic on Earth do you think it would have the same efficacy for samples from a different system that are maybe responding to maybe they have different functions maybe they you know are responding to different uh selection pressures that have caused them to have different patterns like do you have any thoughts about that yeah yeah so uh let me just back up to this [Music] slide right here yes so the idea is that yeah we're our our approach is hopefully agnostic to the specific functions the specific substrate of the biochemistry that has been sculpted by a completely different um trajectory of evolution on a very different worlds right and so the idea is that uh selection for function will basically move abiotic matter somewhere else in this space on Earth it moved it towards here right in in buttons um and and then through degradation might you know change it by moving it this way in the space but on another world it should you know it might sced in a very different trajectory and so uh the BIOS signature technique looking at um you know potentially spotting signs of alien life with very different biochemistries from us uh is basically an anomaly detection um strategy for looking for something with a distribution of organic uh matter that is very different from all known abiotic samples and has been sculpted by Evolution but maybe in a different trajectory from the exact way that life on Earth has because that's just one possibility as some was talking about before today uh you know uh Frozen accidents in evolution right and so we want to expose ourselves to trying to be able to capture all the different kinds of Frozen accidents that may have occurred on different worlds and I think by uh using this method we'll be able to potentially catch a lot of those different end results of evolution that you know wound a different way on uh their respective planets so thank you for the great question I think we are out of time and have to move on to the next person person but I will say there's a break after this where you can go and pick Michael's brain I hope he's okay with that [Applause] yeah turn it off hello can you all hear me okay all right I think I'm gonna stand over here um so my name is Danny Buckey I just finished my second year of my PhD at Penn State working with Jen motti in the geosciences department and I'm going to be talking to you today as you might be able to tell from the title about microbes caves uh but first I want to acknowledge the fact that I currently am the embodiment of the 20 minutes that separates you from the freedom from those very strange chairs um so in honor of that I am going to ask everybody oh did it give up you too probably you can just point at me if you want I can stand behind the podium I don't mind okay I'm sorry oh it's what's going on you know end of the day jitters all right I'm GNA ask everyone to take a deep breath with me let's yeah so I feel pretty powerful right now um no actually what I wanted was for us all to think a little bit about oxygen so often we think of oxygen as being pretty synonymous with life we might think about the oxygen that we breathe that all the animals around us breathe maybe um we think of oxygen produced by plants but what about life before oxygen and so some of you may be familiar with this sort of figure but some of you may not be that solid line there we're looking at the rise in oxygen in our atmosphere over time over Earth history and so if we look down to the hadan and the archan when we think that life was emerging we see that there was very little oxygen in our atmosphere and so instead of things like you know oxygen nitrate sulfate things that we find in surface environments today it was dominated by things like hydrogen sulfide CO2 methane iron 2 and things like that so in this vastly different geochemical environment a lot of astrobiologists have asked okay well what then were Earth's earliest metabolisms with this more limited menu what could microbes at the time do and so there are a lot of ways to try to go about answering that question but one of the ways we can do it is through finding analog environments here on Earth places that look similar to what we think early Earth environments may have looked like and these environments can be Windows into the past through finding these environments here on Earth today we can look at life in them and learn a little bit about the strategies they employ to survive there and maybe we can sort of Trace those things back in time to see if they would have been feasible for early Earth life and so one of these systems is the fassi cave system in central Italy and so this is kind of an interesting cave system because you have this anoxic sulfidic groundwater From Below mixing with this oxygen rich water coming from above but also atmosphere and so you have this geochemical mixing of two very different sort of surfaces clashing and that creates a lot of interesting geochemical niches that microbes live in but for the purpose of this talk I'm going to be focusing on that anoxic sulfidic groundwater that underlies the system and that water floods some of these cave passages today and so about 15 years ago now deep cave explorers and Cave divers discovered a really interesting biofilm in these submerged cave passages and so imagine you're a cave diver swim swimming along and you see that I can't believe they didn't turn around quite frankly um because it's spooky looking it sort of hangs down in these ropey feathery things from any overlying Rock and these ropeik biofilms are full of pyite but also the surrounding water lacks again a lot of those common oxidants we think of in surface environments today so oxygen nitrate iron three are pretty much all always below detection limits in the water so in this way this looks a lot like what we think early Earth environments might have looked like and this bofilm gives us a really interesting opportunity to look at life and what it can do in this environment isolated from other potential sources of energy like serpentinization like photosynthesis this biofilm is kind of on its own down there and so in order to study it more fully we went on an expedition to Italy in February of 2023 and one of the primary goals here was to collect biofilm material for lab based enrichment cultures and so in an enrichment culture you're essentially designing a medium that is supposed to Target a metabolism of interest in a lab setting and so for us we were looking at a couple different Target metabolisms that might be relevant for early Earth environments so first we were looking at methanogenesis now there are a few ways of doing methanogenesis but in this case we were looking at the combination of hydrogen and CO2 into methane and water and so this is thought to be a very early metabolism here on Earth in fact a lot of people think it's perhaps one of the earliest and it's relatively well studied in the lab um as opposed to maybe other more rare metabolisms and so in this case the goal was just to investigate strategies in an early Earth analog environment so are these organisms linking up their metabolism with other organisms are they forming cophies do they depend on each other and do they have any interesting strategies for existing in this relatively low nutrient environment now the second metabolism I was targeting is a little bit different I'm going to call it here the vector's hoer reaction big long German name just like mine um but here we have mineral FES combining with hydrogen sulfide to form pyite that should ring a bell because I mentioned that that bofilm is full of pyate as well as hydrogen gas now this is currently a theoretical metabolism it was first proposed by a man named G vus HOA in uh the late 80s early 90s as potentially an option for the first metabolism on earth based on this sort of iron sulfur World idea that was popular at the time and it should yield some free energy given thermodynamic calculations both sort of in um ideal conditions but also in this particular environment however it hasn't been seen in any microbes that we know of so the goal here is a bit simpler uh the goal was to identify organisms that potentially gain energy from this reaction and so to do this I designed some media so a very very limited liquid medium for these microbes to inhabit and then added the reactants of these two metabolisms into those to try to give them a nice comfy home to want to grow in so for methanogenesis that's hydrogen and CO2 2 and for this vector's hoer reaction that's hydrogen sulfide in the head space but also mineral FES in the liquid itself and so I want to focus on the methanogens first so if we think about what we would expect to see in this bottle over time as this reaction proceeds we would see something like this where over time you see methane increasing in that gas head space and you see hydrogen and CO2 decreasing and so I was able to monitor these cultures that I started last year through gas chromatography just the simple one just GC without the letters at the end but that allowed us to track this over time and so taking a look here uh we're looking at methane curves over time on the x  axis we have the date and then on the y  AIS we have the peak area for methane you can think of this as how much methane there is so the higher the peak area the more methane there is in the bottle and then these solid lines are all all microbial cultures so bottles that had microbes injected into them and then right down at that zero line you might be able to barely see it is a dotted blue line that represents the abiotic control so media that did not have any microbes added to it and so as you can see here that abiotic control really doesn't go anywhere it stays at a pretty much no methane the entire time whereas all of the cultures that have had cells added are increasing in methan over time until they perhaps Peak or even out so that's a really good sign for me right okay I'm getting methane from organisms that are supposed to make methane but what about those reactants and so here we're looking at a very similar sort of plot for CO2 on the left and hydrogen on the right and so we can see here although the trend may not be as obvious by the end of that incubation period we have a definite fall off in both CO2 and hydrogen in the bottles with life versus the abiotic control which pretty much stays the same through the experiment and so these are all really good signs uh methane is increasing CO2 is decreasing hydrogen is decreasing but I wanted to see okay do we actually have cells are we sure that there are cells in there and in fact when we look there were cells and there were quite a few of them but when we stained them with dappy we can see that even better um so that's going to stain cells and hopefully nothing that isn't a cell and we see a couple different morphologies here which is really exciting to verify that these are in fact what we think they are we did some sequencing and this is very fresh data uh for those of you who are into microbes you can geek out for a second for those of you who are not I'll put it plainly um we see that those big blue bars that is dominating most of the cultures here are methos Sarina a um anara that was mentioned earlier and that does in fact make methane through this pathway taking hydrogen and CO2 and making methane but we also have a subset of bottles that has another methanogen growing there a little less common a little less studied this methano celius and that um also is known to take hydrogen and CO2 and make methane so so far we're really excited about having something growing in the lab yay they're growing um they can survive transfers from one bottle where they have sort of expended their food to another bottle and they've done that over three four five transfers which is a really good sign we can keep them growing in the lab now the next steps are to try to isolate those strains characterize them and potentially investigate their role within the larger biofilm Community now turning back to the vector's hoer reaction this is a little bit more difficult it's really it can be challenging to measure hydrogen sulfide um you can measure hydrogen as we saw in the methanogens but something else could be eating that for example methanogens would be very happy to gobble that up so that's not necessarily a great way of tracking a product um and to make all this worse there are other methods of monitoring but they're more destructive the liquid medium is also black and I mean like jet black so you can't even look for changes in um turbidity which might suggest to you that these cells are growing so after about a year of nothing really changing I was ready to give up on these cells and then I thought you know what let's look under the microscope and to my surprise I'm seeing cells this is that same stain that should stain cells and nothing else uh but what was maybe more exciting and made me sort of gasp is this image and if you are a geoscientist you might be like ah I know what that is but for many of you you're like okay it's a bunch of black blobs um this shape is fairly characteristic of pyite framboids so not only do I think I have cells in this culture but I also have pyite and a good amount of pyite too and the cells seem to be pretty closely associated with that pyite but before I got too excited I said okay was this maybe just something that came over with the initial uh inoculation of biofil material so we're looking at that culture here and again we see those pyite framboids throughout the frame and when we look at the abiotic control we see something very different maybe you can pick out a couple blobs that look like they could be pyite but all in all we're seeing pyite in the microbial cultures and not in the abiotic control so that's a really exciting thing um there are cells in the culture likely some of them are active pyite has formed in these cultures over the last year through some sort of mechanism and it's likely that there's a microbial role in that formation given that we don't see the same pyate in the abiotic control so the next steps here are to look and see how active that culture might be how long it's taking them to grow how fast we might be able to get them to grow again um see if we can actually transfer them and keep them growing sometimes this is the biggest challenge with culturing in the lab you get something to grow and then it abruptly dies on you um and we do have sequencing pending so we can figure out who is in those bottles I am desperate to know some quick conclusions here our lab culturing of this unique bofilm is possible on at least months long time scales which is very important when you're trying to finish a PhD um hunting for theoretical metabolisms pretty much has to involve some Creative Solutions and creative thinking about how you're going to track these down lab cultures can in fact form pyate and that's really exciting because we don't really know the role of microbes in pyate formation but also that further field experiments will help us Define the system and very quickly I do want to say that I recently returned to Italy just last month um we were trying to fill in some gaps here with actually some hydrology so looking at things like conductivity and depth of the actual water level to see if perhaps there is influx of fresh oxygenated water over time which really changes the Dynamics of the system but I'm also trying to use the power of the system itself to see if we can grow some of these microbes in capturable forms in its native environment which looks a lot like that and not like a bottle in the lab um but what this really means is that it's just DIY chaos um if I had known the screen was going to be so big I may not have put this picture in but it's a lot of just uh figuring things out putting things in weird other things and sticking it in the water and hoping something grows there uh and with that I would like to thank especially my uh Italian collaborators we couldn't do any of this without the cave divers we work with um they are amazing great people and I literally would not be able to study any of this without them but I'd also like to thank the expert cavers who keep us safe if you've ever wondered what it was like to do field workor in central Italy this is a little sneak peek of what that looks like I'd also like to thank my Penn State and US collaborators and my funding support as well and with that I will take any questions [Applause] hi um I'm CH Kates from Georgia Tech I was uh this is really really cool um I was just wondering if you guys not only did sequencing work of your lab cultures but also of just the environmental samples themselves to see if there any difference in the enrichment yeah so we initially sent off some samples from last year for metagenomic sequencing specifically um I was actually planning on talking about that at this conference unfortunately we just got it back and they were like well it's 99.1% unclassified um and that seems to be typical for this bofilm actually it seems like there is a lot of microbial dark matter and potential for things that we just don't really know too much about um that was of course a metagenome which is a little bit different than the type of sequencing I did on the lab cultures so we have just sent off fresh sample for um 16s and hopefully that'll provide some more solid identifications of some of these microbes but all signs from past work and my own work indicate that this is a pretty diverse biofilm with a lot of unknown microbes in there uh which makes it really exciting to investigate further but also can be very frustrating when you get back like a whole bunch of we don't know um so yes pending very cool thank you thank you Final Call all right thank you for your talk thank you just a little bit of housekeeping before we go on the break we are on break until 4: so you have 40 minutes and then 4 to 5:30 is our first poster session and then at 5:30 we're going to have dinner right out in the poster Hall where we also had lunch and breakfast and there's also a message in the slack about a possible happy hour tonight so if you would like to go please respond with an emoji thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
