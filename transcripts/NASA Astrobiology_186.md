[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] greetings friends fellow earthlings and fans of exploration welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and celebrates the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life astrobiology where does life come from how does it change and evolve where is it located in our universe the questions we all want to know I am your host Dr Graham the cosmo biologist Lao and as always we're brought to you by segnet.org and the NASA astrobiology program as always we want to thank all of you as well for tuning in asking us questions during the live stream chat or if you're watching this later jumping over to the YouTube channel and adding your questions in I do my best several of us come through and look at those questions try to answer them when we can I'm so excited for this week now you might notice I'm in a slightly different environment I'm actually recording in Savannah Georgia uh for this month's episode but I'm so excited to have our guest on the show this month Dr Andrew sugar is joining us he's a scientist at the department of Plant Pathology at the University of Florida Dr sugar worked for 18 years the land a hydroponic research and education facility at Disney's Epcot Center as well as at NASA's Kennedy Space Center his research has gone in many different directions over the years it includes studying the effects of Martian conditions on the survival growth and adaptation of microorganisms as well as investigating things like methane on Mars as a potential biosignature and so I'm so excited to welcome Dr sugar and I hope you will as well Dr sugar thank you very much for joining us for asking astrobiologist oh hey it's my pleasure I'm glad to be here I'm like I said I'm so happy that you're joining us um looking through your bio you've done so many different things uh you earned your your bachelor's degree your master's degree at the University of Arizona um then you worked during your PhD you earned that in 1991 you know the University of Florida working in this realm of microbiology microbial ecology and then Plant Pathology I'm wondering for our audience could you explain what really drove you towards these Realms of like microbiology and Plant Pathology well uh the biggest reason I got into Plant Pathology is I immediately had the sense that it was like being a detective because you have a series of problems with a plant or crop there are symptoms or signs you have to go into it and kind of use all of your knowledge from every course you've taken from every uh you know bit of experience that you've been able to Garner and then figure out what the problem is and then it's another that's first level of detective work and then the next level is to figure out how to control that disease so I just thought it'd be it was a very challenging Innovative discipline and I I've been very pleased with a career at Plant Pathology it's wonderful and of course you're not University of Florida but even while working on your PhD you were working at the land at Epcot Center kind of in this realm of hydroponic research and education um looking in these Management Systems um I'm wondering what you know how did you kind of evolve your career into that realm of like looking in closed loop systems and hydroponic systems and kind of using these as a way to understand Plant Pathology well that's a very interesting question because when I uh before I applied for the position at Epcot Center at the land Pavilion that I eventually got uh I was very interested in going into nature cinematography but my department chair and Plant Pathology at the University of Arizona tracked me down on the hall carrying a sheet of paper and he said this job's for you and it was the announcement of working in a hydroponic complex hydroponic facility up to 40 50 crops agronomic and Horticultural crops and I immediately right when that that department chair showed me that piece of paper made the connection that that is the is sort of like a ground test bed for trying to learn how to grow plants in outer space so that was the reason I applied was that NASA was here in Florida Kennedy Space Center was here in Florida Epcot was here in Florida and this facility growing plants hydroponically was like a ground test bed for doing it in space so I said I have to try and I was lucky enough to get it and it's been it was a real rewarding experience working for Walt Disney World well that's really cool I do have to ask you know since my I really love this realm not just of astrobotany but also the future of Agriculture um what your view is kind of on the future of like things like vertical farms and indoor greenhouses do you think we kind of need to go that direction for not just being sustainable for space exploration but for building a future for humans as well here on Earth well that's a good question too because uh vertical farming has a real important role to play in urban areas where you're growing High cash value crops strawberries lettuce dwarf Tomatoes things of that nature such that you have a very short distance from production facility to sales facility but you have to it's generally economical only if it's a high cash value crop like the ones I just mentioned for bulk growth of plants like wheat potatoes some of the Staples that's probably going to remain for the foreseeable future as a field agriculture uh technology so we really need both we need solid field agriculture with good control of soils and pests and and proper nutritional management of the crops ecologically sound growing as well as vertical farmings for a very targeted uh communities but the the link here is vertical farming is a very good proxy for learning how to grow plants in really small spaces under really tight light and temperature controls that would extrapolate to growing on the surface of Mars or in a habitat on on the moon oh that's wonderful yeah there's there's so much we need to know for better growing food in our spacecraft you know we've now grown plants on the ISS that astronauts have eaten you know homegrown food on the ISS but it feels like that realm is still kind of developing um what do you think are some of the key things we need to know right now for the next maybe decade or two and when it comes to growing plants on a space station moon or on Mars right well uh the number one thing is that uh I I think a lot of your viewers are probably seeing a lot of very complex illustrations artist renderings of a moon base with a very complex agricultural system inside or Mars base with something similar but that's the target that's the goal 10 20 years down the road right now though we're really focused we being the community of astrobiology and plant biology in space we're really focused on trying to optimize plant growth in the microgravity environment on Space Station uh the number of plant growing systems have been developed they've flown and to me as a plant pathologist one of the most intriguing issues that is does not have a lot of research is how do the microorganisms present in let's say the space station or eventually those same microorganisms might be in a a biogenerative life support system on the moon or Mars how do those microbes interact with the plants and is the space environment so stressful to the plants that host resistance that we normally expect from a plant would that break down because of the stresses in microgravity and that's an area that I'm actively doing research right now and it's it's quite enjoyable and and quite challenging that's fantastic and I I do want to talk then a bit about how things will survive on Mars um you know Earth life we we are protected here on our planet by this beautiful magnetic field that's generated by the Dynamo of the outer core of our world you know and I think some people forget sometimes that you know astronauts and other terrestrial organisms going to Mars they're going to face a different radiation environment at the surface of Mars as well as things like the very low pressure the much lower temperature it's an average of negative 90 Fahrenheit at the surface of Mars even though that does drastically change around the world um but first for our audience who are watching live we have a quick pull to drop in the YouTube chat for those of you who are watching right now um we have a question about radiation and how it affects not just humans but some of the extremophiles of our world as well so we humans we get sick with radiation when we get a dose that's actually pretty close to the dosage we would get on the surface of Mars around 0.3 Grays or so a gray is one joule per kilogram that's the absorbed dose of radiation and so our question for you in the YouTube chat and we'll come back to this in a little bit is how much radiation do you think the extremophile dinococcus radio durans can handle and you'll see the answers popping up right now in your chat uh Andrew and I can't see those answers but we'll come back to that in a little bit um okay Andrew from you I just want to hear you know what your what your research has been kind of looking in this realm of survival and growth and the adaptation organisms have had to use to survive in Martian conditions all right so I sent a slide uh with the Mars chamber on it if you could just pop that up briefly uh I I've designed and built a mar simulation chamber here in my lab I've been working with it almost 20 years and it is able to to recreate five conditions on the surface of the current Demars low pressure which is around seven millibars I'm in Florida near the sea level uh near sea level so I'm breathing right now 1000 and 15 millibars but the surface of Mars is actually seven to ten millibar so it's less than one percent of sea level pressure on Earth uh so that's the first Factor second is UV irradiation very strong ultraviolet irradiation environment on Mars because there's literally no ozone layer uh in the Martian atmosphere which allows a lot of the biocidal UV to hit the surface number three is temperature uh gas compositions number four and then the Mars chamber also has a way of simulating either dust free conditions on mars or Global dust storm conditions and everything in between so what I've done if you can then switch to me for a close up I I have these little microbial sample holders this is just one example and this a little piece of aluminum in here is what's called a coupon and upon each of these coupons I would put a different bacterium and these are examples just with a felt tip Panda so they'll show up oh but if you could think the blue coupons are one species of bacterium uh and then the red is a different species I would place this inside the Mars chamber allow the ultraviolet irradiation to come down strike those samples and it's just looking for survival uh how well Can the bacteria and fungi survive just exposure to that solar ultraviolet or radiation and it turns out uh that if the bacterian fungi are exposed out on a flat surface or even if they're kind of shielded a little bit enough solar UV irradiation bounces around and Strikes them that populations as high as two or three million spores per square centimeter can be killed off within three or four hours on the surface of the Equator of Mars uh just within that first soul and if you didn't know a day on Mars is called the soul so in summary from a survival standpoint exposing bacteria and fungi just to the low pressure environment maybe we lose about 20 percent of a population over a few Souls if they're hit with solar UV irradiation uh they're killed off very very quickly but those are only two factors there's there's another 18 to 20 factors that have been discussed for the service of Mars High salts in the soil volatile oxidants in the soil and atmosphere solar UV radiation solar particle events from the Sun that might strike the planet and I won't go on but there's at least 20 biocidal factors all of them working synergistically to reduce the population of spores cells of both bacteria and fungi on the spacecraft well that's rather incredible and so I will come back to our Poll for our audience then with that too since you just said you know some of these spores will Thrive like you know you have this slow kind of process so something's dying off um when it comes to life on Earth there are different kind of ways for for organisms to adapt to the radiation environment for instance in different places um E coli for instance can actually take a much larger dose than humans can um I think the last I read was something like 200 to 700 Grays was kind of a an average decent dose that E coli could still thrive in which is higher than the Martian surface for our Poll for dinococcus radio durans which by the way still holds the record that we know of for a radiation dose it looks like most of our respondents said either a hundred Grays or a thousand Grays but indeed the answer was five thousand plus they can take a dose well over 5 000 times what would get a human sick and still Thrive even tartar grades have been put into 4 000 gray dose environments and have survived and so this is you know that those are very high radiation environments we put dinocoxious radio durans into the the cooling fluid from from nuclear radioactive uh Radioactive uh uh plants for energy and they've survived inside of that cooling fluid um and so you know these things can take a pretty hard blast but then you start adding in all these other conditions just like Dr sugar mentioned you know with the low pressure and then salts and the soil different gas compositions dust and those are the things that we need to study together in a systems approach and so it's really cool your lab is doing that with this Mars chamber have there been any really kind of exciting or surprising results maybe from that research with the Mars chamber uh well I I can't go and answer that question until I make one comment on dinococcus radio durans I was sort of shuffling around there just a moment ago because I literally downloaded a paper this morning that talked about radio dinococcus radio durans surviving exposure up to 120 kilograms now a kilogram is a thousand gray so that would be a hundred and twenty thousand Grays the reason why humans have sort of like a buy I have a a very severe reaction to even extremely low dosage of of radiation is that that radiation is exposing billions and billions of cells in our body whereas a bacterium is a single cell sitting out on a Surface so you have to get the intensity dramatically higher to get that same lethality it's just a body mass issue that's that's uh the difference between human survival and a bacterium surviving so I digress what was the question well that's a very good point so we we did see that paper as well and planning for this episode and it was just so shocking that the radiation dose was that High um that we just did 5000 plus um you know and so there's some more results to support that conclusion but there's a rather incredible conclusion um but I think you know my big question using this Mars chamber you know really having kind of the systems approach now to multiple different scenarios you know these these five different conditions that we made experience on Mars right had any really you know surprising or drastic results that kind of changed how you're thinking about life on Mars yes uh oh about 10 12 years ago I started research moving from survival which is in my view survival is a term that I would use for dormant or inactive cells or spores persisting through time uh they don't have to replicate they're not taking in nutrients metabolizing and dividing so survival could just be a dormant cell lasting a long time I did a lot of work with survival under in the Mars chamber and under UV irradiation and vacuum and temperature extremes and then I started getting interested in bacterial growth metabolism and growth and so I was interested in in determining at seven millibars of pressure at a zero centigrade and with enough liquid water present to keep cells hydrated could any terrestrial bacteria actually metabolize and grow under these Martian surface conditions and I did experiment after experiment bacterium after bacterium and I literally was just ready to say okay I've tried to write a paper that says nothing grew under Martian conditions and the very last bacterium I tested actually grew under the low pressure low temperature and gas composition in the assays so it was a really pleasant surprise and once you establish a protocol that confirmed that this bacterium's name by the way is serratia liquidations it's a non spore forming bacteria found in spacecraft and on surfaces of Hardware mainly Hardware associated with human activity like on the space station or Apollo spacecraft Skylab things like that but in any event once you have I have the basic protocol that I know something will grow under motion distance then we could start going through large numbers of bacteria a lot faster and to date we've identified approximately 30 bacteria but no fungi so far that can grow metabolize and grow under low pressure hydrated conditions similar to the surface of Mars so that's that just with one bacterium one last test changed my whole perspective on what we what might be possible on the surface of Mars wow yeah you know instead of being Eureka it was a huh I didn't I didn't think that would happen kind of moment I love that so much and that kind of also then it's important for my next topic I kind of want to discuss here is the idea of forward contamination um you know there's a whole department an office at Nasa that does planetary protection um figuring out you know how do we you know just not not only avoid contaminating Earth with possible things from elsewhere but how do we avoid taking Earth life and contaminating other places and you know no matter how much we try to clean our cleanest clean rooms are still going to have some some biology we're still going to send some things with our Rovers and when we send humans it gets even more crazy because you know we humans have a microbiome and we're shedding off organisms all the time not just our own cells but other organisms with us um and so you know we'll have this this moment when we get to Mars when humans start exploring especially where you know we are you know putting out Earthly organisms on the surface of Mars and I know you've done some work in that looking at at how we're going to have some issues with forward contamination um I wonder if you can speak to that issue with how we might you know try to avoid you know dumping a bunch of organisms on mars or or can we even avoid that at all well uh we have to step back a little bit before we go to that specific question um look at any image of a Rover like the perseverance we're over right now or curiosity uh and you see this structure these very fairly large structures with all these little nooks and crannies in it uh but if everybody's got to kind of keep in mind that even if there are bacteria and maybe a few fungi and a few of the prokaryotes called archaea if those are all present on the surface that surface is being immediately bathed on as soon as it lands in an extremely strong ultraviolet radiation environment and photons of light are incredibly small scientific Community doesn't even have a consensus on how big they are the best eye estimate I have is 10 to the minus 18 centimeters as the upper limit of how big they might be it's believed to be much smaller so these incredibly tiny little energy packets can get into almost every pit every crack Bounce Around bounce off of one surface to get into a shaded area and I've been doing modeling several papers out working with other colleagues to try to push the modeling and the UV environment alone is so strong on the surface of Mars most of these surfaces of spacecraft and rovers are being sterilized within a few souls for the upper deck and maybe a few months for the stuff that's underneath on the belly of the spacecraft so it's not the bacteria are not lasting for Generations uh it's very likely that the microbiota on these Rovers is being inactivated very quickly okay so we pause there now let's look at human missions human missions yes humans will have a much richer biome that they will bring with them but that biome is contained within a habitat and when they go out and do an Eva it's can that microbiome is contained within their spacesuits so when an astronaut just can think of this as uh just conceptually they may have contamination on the outside of their uh spacesuit they walk out into that incredibly Rich intense UV environment on Mars we're not going to do Evas at night because of temperature issues it's and lighting issues so it'll almost always be done in the daytime and that the data from multiple Labs supports a conclusion that most of the microbiomes on the outside surfaces of objects on Mars can be sterilized within a few hours on one Soul so if an astronaut goes out for eight hours nine hours of an Eva on the surface of Mars his outside or her outside of that spacesuit might be sterilized during the middle of it by the time he gets to the four hour mark in uh in his Eva so I'm not that concerned we're going to overtly ruin the surface and contaminate the service I think the more intriguing issue is how do we prevent bringing stuff back that might have a martian microbiota on it uh because we don't we don't know if one exists and if it does we don't know the characteristics of that life so that's back contamination I'm not so worried about forward contamination I'm a little bit more interested now on what might happen bringing a martian microbiota back to Earth if it's present which we don't it's a very good point we're going to do Mars sample return soon um starting with the samples being cached right now from perseverance but very likely in the not too distant future um maybe not you know tomorrow but in the next you know a couple of decades once humans do go to Mars we'll most likely bring humans back from Mars too eventually um and they'll probably bring some samples back with them and so that possibility is really important I do want to bring up another Twitter poll that we had uh through the NASA oh go ahead I was just going to say one other important point though is that um absence of data does not confirm anything so as a scientist you have to just say there's no data to say this now don't conclude something from that lack of data it's just no data and so you keep your options open you think of all the possibilities but it is it is equally plausible that the surface of Mars and all the regolith is literally sterilized sterilized by gamma rays sterilized by solar particle events sterilized by all those 20 volocital factors that is as equally plausible as some life form that evolved three billion years ago actually uh persisting in learning how to to grow metabolize and evolve on the surface equal no data so that's we we don't jump to either one of those as a scientist and the same thing should hold for the uh regulators and and uh communities that are going to help decide the protocols for both forward and backward contamination absolutely um so I will say uh of our audience we we did ask through Twitter uh through the at Nasa astrobio Twitter account we we asked people what they thought would be the most important obstacle that Earth life might face on Mars with options like radiation low gravity low temperature the very dry conditions and you know overwhelmingly people said radiation um was the largest factor they think would be an issue out of these other possible factors um so do you think you know if there was Martian biota in the distant past that may still be alive or went extinct long ago but if there were some possibility for there to be life on Mars do you think we'd have to get a sample from deeper down under the surface to avoid the radiation to really find any fines of any signs of possible past or present life that's Martian life uh okay so there's two types of radiation the radiation the way you're using the word refers to probably ionizing radiation this is like x rays gamma rays protons helium atoms Etc uh very high energies uh and they can ionize molecules there's also the electromagnetic radiation of UV light so UV light in my view is the strongest biocidal Factor on the surface of Mars followed by desiccation low pressure and low temperature uh the ionizing radiation like gamma rays x rays that dosage is relatively benign from the standpoint of bacterial survival based on Earth bacterial survival under various intensities of ionizing radiation so I think the radiation environment for inactivation on the surface is this UV irradiation the hard radiation or ionizing radiation is probably only a minor Factor unless you're talking about geological time periods intriguing yeah that's really good to know and a good reminder for our audience too about the processes that affect you know living things on Mars as well as possible things like Organics um and so we I do want to jump to our audience uh questions here as soon as I can but there are two more quick things I do want to bring up about your research that you've been working on uh either now or in the past and one has to do with with UV on the surface of Mars you've been doing some work recently on studying the processes of forming and breaking down methane at the surface of Mars and you know for those who are watching they might be aware that you know some years ago we had the first potential detections of methane in large plumes the the Martian surface and now more recently we've had more confirmation of methane at the surface of Mars um so so what has your research been in looking at this production and destructive process when it comes to methane all right so a number of years ago I worked with several other scientists to explore how the ultraviolet irradiation environment that hits the surface of Mars can't is it energetic enough does it have enough energy per photon to break Bonds in a methane in a organic compound releasing methane and it turns out that it does uh the exact mechanism uh if for which that that process occurs is not really worked out but it clearly our research clearly demonstrated uh that the ultraviolet irradiation that reaches the surface can cleave or break down Organics in the surface environment and in the atmosphere releasing methane what's intriguing is that the Curiosity Rover with the uh an instrument called the MSL um I'm sorry called Sam Dash TLS which is an organic detection instrument with a specific tunable laser that it can detect methane very very small levels of methane it had a has had there's a number of papers published with this detection down in the parts per billion range so 2017 15 years ago we had data from Earth telescopes of large plumes of methane in the Martian atmosphere followed with some skepticism by the community then the MSL rover Curiosity started detecting it and showing spikes in it in methane but then the trace gas Orbiter which is an Esa instrument or a spacecraft it is now completely gone negative on that methane story it cannot detect it and it's setting extremely low levels for methane in the bulk mesh and atmosphere so what I think is happening based on just the literature available is that the methane concentrations that are being detected by the Mars rover Curiosity could be very close to the ground maybe only up to a few tens of meters to a few hundreds of meters and then those are dissipated through the day and when the methane is diluted out in the bulk atmosphere then the trace gas Orbiter is having trouble seeing that methane now that's an open area of study but if we can confirm that methane exists we it has to constantly be resupplied because the solar UV breaks down methane which is what my research and others have shown uh so it's a very interesting topic because if it's there and we can confirm it it could be a biogenic signature or bio signature of some Subterranean methanogenic Community it might be three four kilometers down into the crust of Mars uh but if it's present it'll those those will seep out eventually and and that's what we might be seeing but I'm starting to get into speculation here so sticking with just the data we have these versus big plumes that are local detection now the trace gas Orbiter is saying well not so fast maybe it's not there yeah it's rather incredible and you know your career you've done so many different things and I love that about astrobiology you know myself everyone I speak to in the realm of astrobiology hasn't just focused on one individual topic we've you know kind of touched all these different areas um and an astrobiology itself you know that's kind of crucial when it comes to understanding the nature of life and and one thing you worked on in the past was this thing called Dart uh the dust atmospheric recovery technology um for kind of looking at plant and human pathogens in dust plumes coming from Africa coming across the world and kind of coming here and that really sparked my own interests a lot I've been involved in the past um with some undergraduate level research and looking at uh aerobiology and how organisms are lofted into the atmosphere and move around a very good friend of mine David Smith NASA Ames he did research during his PhD looking at organisms being lofted from the Gobi desert and for eight days making their way across the world and kind of variety driving you know through the atmosphere to California and then you know we've now learned that the way the Amazon rainforest is being fertilized with phosphorus is from dust from the Saharan region of Africa being lofted and coming over here and it shows this beautiful connection of life on Earth but then you know you were also involved in this realm of kind of thinking about pathogens for plants and humans being lofted up as well I wonder if you could speak about you know that research what intrigued you about it and maybe kind of your vision for these things moving around the planet and this connectivity of Life yeah exactly the the planet uh the planet's atmosphere circulates pretty much everywhere so if in theory something is present in the Saharan Desert that will eventually be recirculated all over the planet eventually dropping or depositing out in the Arctic regions and the equatorial regions and the amount of dust being moved from the Sahara to North America is quite dramatic just in Florida every year 50 million metric tons of dust comes from Africa usually in the months of July middle of July through the middle of September but over in the Northwest this would be Northern California Oregon and Washington State up into British Columbia uh they're getting about another 60 or 70 million metric tons of dust coming from the Chinese the Gobi desert in China so there's a large volume of it bringing a lot of nutrients most of the fertility not only in the Amazon but in the islands in the Caribbean are due from the minerals that are coming from over geological time have come from the Saharan Desert So This Global movement is very interesting and there's a concept called emerging pathogens and there are a lot of institutes that study emerging pathogens a pathogen that was not present in one area suddenly becomes very active it could be a plant pathogen it could be an animal pathogen it could be a pathogen to fish or aquatic ecosystems or it could be a human pathogen so I just became as a plant pathologist I became very intrigued on whether or not plant pathogens were being moved around in these dust storms and the evidence pretty much supports that they are but we don't have it really kind of well characterized with the volume of those plant pathogens are and how much impact if any the plant pathogens are doing to the agricultural systems in these regions wow yeah and so for any of our audience who are watching who are interested in in this realm of research and microbiology and plant pathogens you know plant how plants function in general um there's so much to take from this that you can be an astrobiologist and work on so many of these different kinds of topics um I do want to move now I know that we're running out of time and so I want to move now to our faster than light segment this is where we just have some rapid fire questions um and so I just have a few that I want to ask you um to bring up some of these topics that are relevant to astrobiology and a lot of us kind of want to know from all the astrobiologists we speak to so the first question comes from Enrico Fermi when he when he first asked you know like where are they out there uh what is your favorite answer to fermi's question where are they oh fascinating I just read a book called where is everybody um and it's about trying to solve the Drake equation which was developed in an attempt to answer Enrico fermi's uh question and they gave 50 reasons why aliens haven't been in contact 50 plausible hypotheses of all of those I think the most reasonable is that the astronomical distance between Star systems are so incredibly huge that it is fundamentally impractical for aliens to travel between Star systems and just as an example uh Alpha Satori which is a cluster of three stars sort of in this very really incredible dance going on three dimensional orbits that's 4.2 4.26 light years away current rocketry would take like 80 000 years to have a spaceship reach the closest star so that I think is the best solution the distances are just way too big to have this easily happen absolutely I mean there are you know crazy vast distances in space that kind of bend the human mind but I'm glad you mentioned book our next question is is what stories have inspired you to want to pursue your career and learn more about life in the universe well I got to tell you uh it goes back to fourth grade uh it's I won't tell you the whole story because it's got more complicated but fundamentally I was struggling in fourth grade I didn't like to read I was bored I was a class clown in the back you know causing trouble and we had to buy a book from a book club so I brought in my 50 cents plopped it down and I was looking around you know you can imagine a little kid oh this is so boring oh and then I came across a title that said Mission to Mars and I said huh that sounded like fun so I bought this book it was about a family going to Mars and they meet martians the Martians helped them to survive because their life support system wasn't working right and so it's really been fun now to work and it closes the circle I had a new spark in fourth grade to think about outer space and mooc and flying to other planets and that came from that one single book uh and now I'm working on Mars astrobiology I think that's a really cool Circle that is really cool you know you're speaking to that young kid in me he used to go to the Scholastic Book Fair and buy a bunch of books for you know a nickel or a dime each and then you know get nerding out over the science and then then the culture and the history and all these things exactly um you know and now in your career it's been quite a while since fourth grade you've done so many cool things in your career if you could though go back to the very beginning of your career and give yourself some advice what advice would you give yourself wow uh get done with your graduate work as fast as possible but doing excellent work don't dwell on stuff and get out into the the academic environment if that's where you want to go research in Academia or at Nasa centers or or other National Labs get your graduate work done quick get out and start making uh making a name for yourself and doing some fun work and the second advice is pick really cool field work field sites so uh doing that Dart that dust collection system I was able to fly in a f 104 star fighter jet something I've wanted to do my whole life since I was just a little kid so uh you know just have fun and but get to it love it so much well let's talk about the things that excite you then you know when you were a kid you were excited by this this f 104 Starfighter um but right now you know not just in your career and the research you've done but just in general what excites you about the future well I am just totally Blown Away to be basically just amazed on the natural world uh the the big bang happened 3.8 billion years ago we started with primarily hydrogen and now we have every everything that we have uh and there is a very logical rational process from going from hydrogen gas in the early Universe all the way up to complex medicine animals like humans and giraffes and uh penguins and that that whole wide range on how soil chemistry played into it evolution of stars Jed there's different populations of stars metal Rich Stars metal poor Stars uh all of that comes together and there's just this amazing Universe out there and I I'm Blown Away by by some of the documentaries that are on TV and in in you know broadcast YouTubes and things like that it's just wonderful yeah definitely and I I was you know I was a young kid I would watch like the Discovery Channel and The Learning Channel back when they had actual science content and I would get so like just amazed by these documentaries and things I remember one from the 90s called solar Empire that just like it blew my mind thinking about what we were learning about science and that brings me to my last question in this faster than light segment what is a science fact that maybe you still find unbelievable or that still blows your mind that we are here this can be stated that simply uh the big Banks we know when the Big Bang started 3.88 billion years ago but what's the trigger where'd that energy come from uh and the fact that again we went from hydrogen gas through seller Evolution planetary Evolution biological evolution and here we are a species capable of thinking about all of that that that's what really sort of blows my mind that's beautiful yeah you know it kind of blows my mind too um just the fact that we get to exist for even a short window each of us uh in this world this universe you know this Cosmos and some of us get to explore it together and learn more about our place um I really appreciate that so much from you um I'm going to open it now for our audience q a I know we have a bunch of questions coming in from YouTube in the live chat uh and so let's just get started and see what everyone wants to ask um first starting off uh user at rendering reality on Twitter has said friendly bacteria like strains of bacillus subtilis used for watering or foliar feeding make organic farming a near closed loop system is there any research using uh good bacteria or bacteria from Earth on making an organic closed loose loop system for Martian farming there is actually research in that topic uh both in Academia as well as in NASA uh these these growth promoting beneficial bacteria fungi prokarya amoeba algae a whole diversity of microorganisms are going to be present in any lunar biogenerative life support system or Mrs bioregenerative life support system and we have we have got to understand how those beneficial organisms are going to interplay with the plants and with the humans in these closed environments and so because humans are will be in so much more intimate contact with the life support systems and on mars or on the moon uh we have there's more to understand on how beneficial organisms interact with our own microbiomes so there is research underway and it's a really exciting area of future work for the space program wonderful our next question comes from Roshan bukhari on YouTube Roshan has basically asked what role do you think AI will play when it comes to Future robotic explorers looking for Life on Mars oh AI well I'm worried about AI because I saw this documentary called Terminator and just kidding just kidding uh no AI is a very important uh scientific area of study and it's so um I don't know how to predict how it's going to really play out uh so I I almost have to say I had no comment on this simply because it could be so amazing and then yet maybe it doesn't really reach the full potential that we think it might be able to reach so uh I think Advanced Computing is absolutely key to successful missions to Mars and to the surface of of the Moon uh and every time I struggle to get my little iPhone to work or or on my TV programmed I think golly uh we're gonna have trouble going to Mars but AI is going to help us solve that um that's about all I can say really yeah absolutely there's a lot of Advanced Technologies not just around the corner or coming up tomorrow they're here now you know we are using a lot of Advanced Technologies and so our next question from user tessellated on YouTube um is about not an advanced technology necessarily but one about using tissue culture and whether we can apply tissue culture to astrobotomy I think for myself first I will say you know I've talked to people out there who are you know in the process of developing companies to do things like lab grown meat um lab grown fish meat for instance making a sushi grade tuna in the laboratory or making beef hamburgers in the laboratory I do think eventually we're going to see people who are learning now how to do tissue culture we'll be going out with their friends who are organic chemists and things like this and learning how to develop lab grown Meats for the space station and Mars um but Dr sugar what do you think of using tissue culture in astrobotomy well there are many different types of tissue culture which you just mentioned there's tissue cultures have produced pathogen free plantlets that would be then propagated into your biogenerative life support system I think that's a done deal that will be used uh there's tissue culture to create uh perhaps genetically modified crops that have vitamins added in that might not normally be there one of the big concerns with humans going to Mars is a long period of time are we going to be able to preserve vitamins you know in the normal little pills they begin to degrade over a release and reasonable short periods of time so we might need to grow plants that have vitamin C in them that are genetically engineered for vitamin C and tissue culture has a role to play in that uh having the astronauts eat artificial fish and artificial Meats that's very very scenario although well I'd really hate not having a nice rib eye bone in rib eye over cooked over the Barbie so but but the technology will be a part of these space exploration efforts absolutely um our next question comes from user Haley Monaco on YouTube and it's an interesting one um how could we differentiate between geological methane and biologically produced methane on Mars is there a way for us given current technology to differentiate yeah we can do that now on Earth uh and it's really due to the isotopic fractionation it's called Uh carbon 12 is the primary carbon atom that makes all of us uh there's a small amount of carbon 13 which has one extra Neutron and then even a smaller amount of carbon 14 and biological methane has a different carbon 12 to 13 to 14 ratio then abiogenic methane generally speaking abiogenic methane will not be enriched in carbon 13 or carbon 14 it'll be sort of a straight ratio of you know I think it's I think it's 98 carbon 12. 1.9 percent carbon 13 and then 0.1 percent carbon 14. but biology has the ability to enrich some of those those Isotopes and so that's one way to tell the difference between biogenic methane and abiogenic methane yeah absolutely then that's important it's also important to know the source of the the carbon isotope reservoirs that we might have on Mars and so that will require a lot of work too figuring out you know what are we starting with for isotopic uh abundances on Mars when we have a sample the methane's coming from um now we do have a user Mark Lumsden on Twitter has asked a question if we have any evidence of Life possibly being based on different chemistry um people often often ask you know like carbon based life versus silicon based life could there be other solvents out there besides water I will personally say an answer to Mark um silicon based life is a possibility it might be that we actually create maybe post biological life on Earth will be silicon based because we've made it that way um it is worth looking into the chemistry though silicon silicon bonds are not nearly as strong as carbon carbon bonds and they're also not super stable in water like carbon is and so there might be a different environment a product cryosolvins for instance are a place where silicon silicon bonds are much stronger and can survive a lot better and so it's worth looking into the chemistry if you're really interested in this question mark however Andrew for you our next user THM on YouTube has said that they're interested in inter researching microbes living in lava tubes do you have any recommendations for them of what they might want to look into when it comes to understanding how microbes would thrive in a unique environment like that wow that that's a very good topic I sometimes think back on a discipline that I wish I would have gone into from a career standpoint and Cave microbiology is one of that one of those topics I've been into some caves in the southwest of the United States that uh on the outside of the cave there's it's dry hot of desert terrain desert ecosystems you drop down into the cave and it there's literally fog in the cave just just a few tens of meters from The Cave opening there's literally fog forming condensation on the walls with an incredible diversity of microbial species on the walls and on the ceilings uh when I first saw that you know 10 years ago on a field trip at a conference it was like wow that's so exciting uh how to get into it the best thing to do on any discipline of how to get into it is look into the literature on who's publishing in the last few years on your topic so if you find papers of a scientist that's published you know on the Southwest lava tube caves in a variety of locations contact them uh if they're if their literature is is not in your topical area but it's in cave microbiology and but what they're doing is not that interesting contact them and say this is what I'm interested in doing who would you might recommend that would be a different Professor uh and so the best thing is just get into it get find out what you're interested in and write to the people and ask for a little bit of advice they mostly will will respond to you that's fantastic and great advice one way to find really good mentors and advisors out there is just to reach out to people who are doing the work um but it's also a great way to make those connections to find people who can help you uh find the research and so I really appreciate that as well it's always advice that I love to hear given to people um our next question comes from astativa arai on YouTube um and I'm gonna change their question a little bit they want they want to know how important is the Criterion of salinity in the Martian soil when it comes to living things including growing um and so for the Martian and we call it regolith um for Martian regolith not just you know salinity but how important are the actual salts themselves for instance I know an astrobotonist who has pointed out that you know in the Martian that Mark Watney eating those potatoes would have been in trouble because he didn't clean the perchlorate salts out of the Martian regalith first so I wonder uh Dr sugar if you can speak to the Martian regolith it's chemistry and maybe how important some of these salts are right uh boy that that could be a whole topic an hour long topic just on the geochemistry of the Martian regolith uh the main thing is that the salts uh on Mars the regolith is composed of ground up basaltic material that's been weathered or acted upon over geological times with water water vapor um and other uh energy sources like UV irradiation with water vapor with mixing of minerals so there is actual weathering of the soils much more than on the moon and here's a great example I got to use my little my little show and tell here in this hand is a gray lunar simulant that I use in my lab this is a primary mineral it's just like ground up Basalt which is like lava okay this is the Martian stimulant and it is orange like now the chemistries of these two are very similar they're basic chemistry this is basaltic this is basaltic but what's happened here with the Martian stimulant is that water and oxygen have acted upon this material over geological time and have altered it such that it's more complex in its geochemistry it is has a lot more salts in it the salts are forming and dissolving and forming and changing because of this liquid water environment that's hap that's been on Mars in the past so these two little soil samples are very different but yet they started out at the same which is basalt and so on Mars there is a problem with some of these soils might have salts that are too high a concentration to use those soils immediately for growing plants in so we might have to figure out methods of leeching out the salts or chemically extracting the salts from the soils before they can be used to grow plants on so that's one thing the other thing is that the salts themselves the little tiny micro crystals of salts can land on a spacecraft surface and if they come into contact with a bacterial cell that little super Crystal of salt can actually kill a lot of different bacterial cells just by contacting you don't even need liquid water to have the salt dissolve in so salts are one of those biocidal factors that are on the in the Martian regolith they can kill bacteria and spacecraft surfaces and we might have to learn how to remove the salts before we can use the regulate for growth and that's actually a really important area of research that needs to be done yeah absolutely it's so important for us to know how we could use that regolith to grow and to use as a building material as well to you know to reinforce our habitats to things like that to build habitats um there's so much to learn our next question for you comes from Milton mendocha Jr at Ms mendocha Jr on Twitter uh they want to know that if there is life on Mars Martian life not earth life but it's not based on things like DNA and proteins would there still be a way for us to understand um biological things like how the resisting radiation salinity maybe even if they're there well uh I think the scientific Community believes or uses the definition of life that requires a series of steps that leads to Evolution adaptation so life has to be able to take in whatever liquid they're using as their medium in our case it's water life has to take in nutrients life has to have the mechanisms within the cell or cells to take those raw materials and make whatever they need to make in order to divide and then keep the process going through multiple cycles and that process requires a road map a genetic road map that could be DNA uh well in our case it's DNA but it could also be DNA on the surface of Mars because there's our two planets of exchanged Rock debris early in our in our history and continue to this day so if life was present on an early Earth it could have been transported to Mars and or vice versa uh so life requires this process and at the end of that process is evolution so if there is an extant microbiota on the surface of Mars or in the shallow subsurface it has to have those ingredients it has to be able to acquire nutrients which means we should be able to figure out what it needs as a set of nutrients it's going to be sensitive to some things and not to others and we should be able to figure that out um the real question is on Earth greater than 99 of the microorganisms that are in our environment are not a we're not able to grow them in the laboratory uh so that creates quite a lot of difficulty in looking at their basic metabolism basic methods of evolution and adaptation there are methods to doing that and I think those same methods can be applied to any microbes on Mars that are not cultural but the last point of this question is that like Earth Mars if there's life has a series of ecosystems it's not just a single bacterium sitting on a rock saying hey I hope I get sunlight today there's an ecosystem there and there has to be energy flow within that ecosystem and it has to be chemical flow and disequilibrium's uh creating the ability to do work in that ecosystem that is something that's really complex and it's it's like we should be able to see that if there's life then there's ecosystems and we should be able to detect those I believe without without invoking very unusual exotic silly based life or methane based life at you know minus 300 degrees or whatever that's awesome uh so I so much appreciate your time and joining us here um I apologize though it's been great then you have so many more questions but we are at the very top of the hour um if I could just ask for a really brief answer to one more question um I saw one that I really liked from kashish Gupta on YouTube um so so kashish has asked Dr sugar if you get to send a single microbial species on a future Mission to Mars which one would you pick wow I don't want to send any microbes to Mars um I would pick a cyanobacterium capable of starting the process of terraforming the planet if I was if if we were if we understood the environment on Mars enough and humanity is ready to take the step towards uh you know terraforming the surface of Mars my first thought would be to begin sending microbes I could take carbon dioxide out of the air produce oxygen maybe even utilize the nitrogen uh so that that would be I think the most intriguing but that's tens of years away if not hundreds of years away absolutely yeah well thank you so much for that answer um to the rest of our audience I apologize we couldn't get to all of your questions there were so many good ones there um if you are interested uh you can always ask your questions in the comments
