[Music] hi I'm Kimberly Sinclair I'm from the University of Washington department of Earth and space Sciences I'm working with David catling and Tim Elam I'm going to talk to you guys about this project the mineralogy of evaporites and sediments in the alkaline phosphate Rich Lakes of the Caribou Plateau which is work I've been doing with Sebastian Haas and is funded by the Simons Foundation okay so I want to give you a bit of background about the phosphorus problem in astrobiology because I know we're all coming from very different backgrounds uh there's a lot of biology talks this morning though so I'm sure a lot of you guys are caught up on this but uh so we all know DNA on the right hand side here has this sugar phosphate backbone and then you have your base pairs or if you zoom in closer you're seeing your phosphate group your sugar and your nuclear base here and in order to get this phosphate to incorporate into the nucleotide you need very high levels of phosphate and this has been shown by research done by powder at all in 2009 so this question we want to ask is how much phosphorus is actually available for Prebiotic phosphorylation on early Earth um and even though we need these very high concentrations of phosphate up to one molar in Prebiotic phosphorylation experiments we only see very low concentrations of phosphate in the environment close to the micromolar level and that's because in natural Waters phosphate will combine with calcium and fall out of solution as an insoluble mineral known as appetite or calcium phosphate before reaching very high concentrations so there's a bit of a problem here and that's what we call the phosphorus problem we've proposed a solution to the phosphorus problem in a paper by toner catling in 2020 the hypothesis was stated that abundant carbonate leads to calcite formation calcite being calcium carbonate thus suppressing the calcium phosphate mineral formation and leaving phosphorus in solution to concentrate to higher levels so in order to test this Theory we visited the most phosphorus rich lake in the world this plot on the right hand side is from toner and catling 2020 you see a very high phosphorus concentrations in these lakes on the top right side which are good enough in last chance Lake and so that's where we wanted to visit to understand why you're getting these very high concentrations of phosphorus we can then apply our understanding of these Lakes to possible analog Lakes on Prebiotic Earth where origin of life could have happened so a little bit about these Lakes last chance and good enough Lakes are carbonate Rich alkaline soda lakes on the Caribou plateau in British Columbia Canada left hand side you see the map of British Columbia here in this green swath is the Caribou Plateau it's right East of those coastal mountains not too far north of Vancouver if you were to zoom in on Google Maps you would see the lakes here good enough Lake here and last chance Lake here they both have very high phosphate concentrations but particularly Last Chance Lake gets up to 37 millimolar of phosphorus which is very high in comparison to that micro molar level that we're usually seeing in natural Waters and this is an image of Last Chance Lake taken in November 2021 which is what it looks like from the ground level so you're seeing it form into these sort of brine pools so a little bit of context from these Lakes they're too small less than kilometer squared shallow closed Basin lakes with sodium carbonate sulfate chlorine brines these are typical major ions of soda Lakes developed on basaltic Rock they're sulfate potassium phosphate and magnesium are abundant whereas calcium iron silicon and dissolved inorganic nitrogen are present at very low concentrations uh the salinity reaches up to 462 grams per liter which is about 13 times seawater salinity so they're very salty and the pH ranges from 9.7 to 10.7 in both of these Lakes depending on the time of year and the location in The Lakes because they do get spring in fed from surrounding rivers and such or sorry from groundwater not reverse so we wanted to go and visit these Lakes over different seasons in order to understand how the mineralogy of different precipitates and evaporites as well as precipitates in the sediments change so we went in winter summer and fall and you can see the corresponding pictures here in Winter 2021 you see these brine pools starting to freeze over um and summer 22 to 2022 it enters this ephemeral Lake stage where it has enough water that it actually covers the entire surface and then in Autumn 2022 these brine pools are drying out into Salt Flats and so there's basically no water left in this system at all it's just salt so we wanted to collect lots of different evaporites which are these salts that are forming around the lake shore as well as precipitates within the lake these are different fun examples of evaporites we collected so in our winter trip you get a lot of these salts forming on rocks Around the Lake Shores around the brine pools in June this is an example of a precipitate that formed and fell to the bottom of the lake and so you can pick it up from under the water it's a lot of salt mixed in with mud and clay and then in September when it's in that salt crust phase you can dig into the salt crust and take this out and that's what the cross section looks like so you're getting these very white opaque salts on the top that middle layer of translucent Neutron salt in the middle and then a layer of algae right above the mud we also wanted to collect sediments from the lake bottom and so these are pictures of us collecting different sediment samples with sediment cores we did it both around the lake shore as well as at the lake bottom and then the center picture you see is us taking those sudden cores and chopping off different depths in order to see how the mineralogy changes with depth in the sediments so we did a mineralogy analysis with x ray diffraction we used a Brooker d8 powder x ray diffractometer with a copper anode microfocus x ray source which is the Micro Focus x ray source is really useful when you have very small quantities of powder that you're trying to analyze and a plotus 100K large area 2D detector is really helpful when you want to increase the resolution of your diffraction patterns um just a quick note about sample preparation we tried to isolate the mineral phases visually as much as we could from our samples in order to simplify the pattern matching uh grind it up really fine you want to have good particle statistics for x ray diffraction and then dropping it onto a silica zero background sample holder to try and get that flat homogeneous surface that's so important and then for those of you who haven't seen xrd Data before this is sort of what it looks like uh you've got your two Theta on the x axis intensity and the y axis and your observed pattern is in blue this is using a software called gsas2 which is an open source code for xrd analysis and then you're trying to match database database patterns of different minerals to this observed pattern and so the calculated one pattern that's a conglomeration of all the different mineral phases we've identified as shown in green overlaid on top of that observed pattern um so this is an example of one evaporite and one sediment from these Lakes uh going through on this evaporite here we've identified multiple different sodium carbonate phases so there's a lot of thermom nitrite which is sodium carbonate with one water molecule at the 60 weight percent level and then for reference in this sample here the thermonitrite is this blue and so each mineral you're supposed to you expect to see different Peaks and um the two Theta range and so we're just matching those Peaks we're also seeing Toronto which is another sodium carbonate as well as the nardite sodium sulfate halide sodium chloride brookite which is a sodium carbonate sulfate and acolyte sodium bicarbonate so these mineral phases are all very common and these evaporates we're finding across these Lakes while in the sediment we're seeing a lot of feldspars like albeitgeite as well as an orthoclase and a northite and other samples around the 70 to 20 to 30 percent range um a secondary phase we're seeing a lot of in the sediments is Dolomite which is that calcium magnesium carbonate and that's very important I'll come back to that in a moment we're also seeing a lot of minor phases like quartz and vesuvianite and other things like that that are just present in the natural soil in the area so then you do this a bunch more times because you're a graduate student and you do a lot of Labor and you take a lot of samples and this comes together into the complete xrd results from the study so I've divided this into results for last chance Lake as well as good enough Lake and then in each respective like the sediments and the salts the salts being the evaporites around the lake shore as well as the precipitates and the lake on the left hand side we have all the different mineral phases we've identified so in the sediments the main phases of Interest were these feldspars both plagioclase feldspar as well as Alkali or k feldspars as well as Dolomite those calcium carbonates is and Mica the clay minerals we're also seeing some thermonitrite that sodium carbonate and the good enough Lake sediments but not in the last chance Lake sediments and then the main mineral phases we're seeing in the evaporates or the salts are those sodium carbonates both thermonitrite and Trona as well as burkite that sodium carbonate sulfate a quick word about hydrated minerals we only detected thermonitrite which is sodium carbonate with one water molecule in the xod patterns after sample preparation however previous studies of this area have identified Neutron salts as the predominant phase Natron is just sodium carbonate with 10 water molecules um and so if the relative humidity is below 60 percent at zero degrees Celsius or 70 percent at room temperature then Natron will lose its water and turn into therminatrite and so we're just anticipating that's what happened in our samples here since the relative humidity in indoor environments is around 50 percent so you can see this pot on the right hand side from Hanes at all showing Natron here turning into thermonitrite when you've decreased relative humidity and increased temperature so in summary we found that the evaporite so the salts are dominated by sodium carbonates sodium carbonate sulfate and sodium chloride demonstrating the predominance of that sodium ion in The Lakes whereas the sediments are dominated by carbonates both Dolomite and acry as well as feldspars plagioclase and kfeldspar quartz peroxine and Clay minerals however the big takeaway was we found no calcium phosphate which is that appetite I talked about earlier in any of the samples and this was confirmed by icpms data showing very low abundance of phosphorus and all of the different samples we've taken so it's not just an xrd fluke it's also backed up by Elemental abundances um these results are consistent with the hypothesis that calcium carbonates precipitate early in the mineralization sequence of these Lakes thus decreasing the dissolved calcium concentrations and allowing phosphate to accumulate to high concentrations instead of precipitating out as appetite which is that calcium phosphate um so phosphates accumulating to high concentrations in solution and that's great for that Prebiotic phosphorylation that you need very high phosphate concentrations to get that incorporation into your nucleotides and the potential origin of life so these could be really good environments for analogs for hidean Earth Lakes where life started and that's it thanks Kimberly we have plenty of time for questions I have a quick one for you yeah um do you know how good enough Lake was named question and when they win like yeast I was just curious because when we were in Australia there was a lot of strange Lake names out there like dead kangaroo uh Peaks Piggery and we didn't really understand like the history of them but yeah anyway there were a lot of jokes in the field uh about oh it's our last chance to get our last chance sample and stuff like that hi I'm Ellie from CU Boulder and I was wondering if the so I know you said your sediments are pledged all my Micah and feldspar dominated I was curious if you would think that the similar pattern that you saw here would happen even if your soda Lake was hosted by a different type of like set like Base Rock essentially like if we change instead of balsaltic or things like that like do you feel like the same pattern would hold in terms of the precipitation of the evaporites yeah um these Lakes are very dependent on the host mineralogy and so you wouldn't expect to see the same um aqueous chemistry and a different host environment and that's one of the reasons why these uh this environment is so interesting is because of that uh plagioclase bass Rock causing um this very specific aqueous chemistry um so even just like what is it 100 miles nearby is an incredibly sulfate rich Lake that people study for different reasons so slight change in geology big change in aqueous chemistry a really interesting talk uh I have kind of two questions um you mentioned that you collected samples seasonally ended sediment by death measurements do you see any variability um in your mineralization based on like seasons and was that reflected any depth transect yes we hoped we would see more variation but we didn't uh the only variation you really saw was that you could say and maybe this isn't even a statistically like significant conclusion is that you might see more Dolomite at the top of the sediment core so like right in the interaction Zone with the water you're getting less Dolomite at depth which makes sense for calcium carbonate precipitating out of solution whereas at depth in the sediment cores you're getting more of those feldspars which is just the host Rock but not as much in terms of seasonal variation two slides back yeah so like you have data for I think uh necklite and third nine diet which has uncertainty higher than the data so is it normal or how can you explain this sorry could you say the last part again so the uncertainty in the data is higher than the the value so can you explain this yes because a lot of these samples only have these minor phases and a couple of the samples um and so there's just not very good counting statistics we're talking about maybe three out of 100 samples or something that have these minor phases um so yeah a Taylor plattner at Georgia Institute of Technology this was really cool I had no idea that these Lakes were so high in phosphate um I know a couple people that are have studied like last chance Lake and then the basket Lakes um I was curious um because you're saying at the end you know interesting in terms of like the origin of Life have you thought about actually I have a couple questions um have you thought about like looking at what maybe preserved in in these salts or and I also have a question on I know you did xrd do you plan on doing any other analyzes um with your samples yeah so I guess your first question about if we're studying uh the present Life in The Lakes yeah yeah so um out of my macroscopic scale when you go there it's really interesting because you see all these brine flies that are just encrusted in the salt um which is kind of it's kind of freaky because in the summer you're like encompassed by flies and then in the winter it's like a fly cemetery and there's just a bunch of dead flies on the ground but um in a more astrobiology sense um there are other uh teams um at I think it's shoot University in Canada who are studying the current microbiology in the ice because there are living microbes in the ice in the winter and so we're not necessarily doing that work but there are colleagues who are um wait what was your second question yes okay so uh my section of the work was a lot about the mineralogy of the sediments and the evaporites but my colleague Sebastian hosted a lot more of the water chemistry um and so we're submitting a paper now and hopefully you'll be able to read that and hear all about his work as well thank you very much Kimberly yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music]
