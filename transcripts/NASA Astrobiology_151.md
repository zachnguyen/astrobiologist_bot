[Music] so hi I'm Zoe havlina I am a PhD candidate from New Mexico Tech um and I would like to just jump right in and introduce my field site for this project which are two cave systems located in central Italy so pictured here they're very pretty and what I can hopefully show you um I'm going to take us on a quick field trip there is why these are potentially very compelling sites for astrobiology or for geomicrobiologists such as myself and so these caves form through a somewhat rare mechanism which is known as sulfuric acid speliogenesis so this is a cave building process that's seen only in a handful of caves worldwide and only only a fraction of those can we actually access those caves and see this process actively happening today and so that's what I'm showing you here so these are all images from one of my field sites which is a Versace cave system and what you're looking at in this image here on the left this is a stream this is the groundwater level of the cave and it's enriched in hydrogen sulfide and this hydrogen sulfide degases where there's voids in the host Rock of the cave and this hydrogen sulfide fuels very a robust microbial communities that are thriving off of the energy in this otherwise very leukotrophic environment and this is seen kind of conspicuously in the forms of these charismatically named snodite biofilms which proliferate in these areas of the cave here's another picture of what they look like and we also sometimes see if you can see the yellow dots native sulfur that can precipitate in these areas as well and these are primarily composed of citythial bacillus which is a sulfur oxidizing bacteria but what I'm interested in for the context of my project are all of these white I don't know if you can see my pointer here these white clumpy minerals here and this is actually microcrystalline gypsum this precipitates in part kind of as a consequence of this microbial activity because the sulfur oxidizers are producing sulfuric acid which is obviously highly corrosive when you have a carbonate host Rock and so this gypsum is precipitating as a replacement as this host Rockets corroded and it's highly acidic so pH is usually zero to one and what happens is that this gypsum can build up in these cave systems and remain there essentially as long as you don't have any Waters that come in and wash it away and so that's what I'm showing on this image on the far right here this is one of these like massive gypsum deposits that exists in a part of the Versace cave that hasn't been exposed to this active sulfide degassing for maybe a hundred to two hundred thousand years and so we see sulfates and gypsum on other locations notably the surface of Mars so I'm showing you data here as it relates to the Gale crater and there's some evidence or some thinking that this sulfates could have also precipitated under acidic conditions so potentially these are thought of as places where we might look for for evidence of life and on the Earth's surface the analogs that we have there are several and these have been well studied by other teams of astrobiologists but what is novel um or the argument I'm making for these caves is that this is an ecosystem that as I just showed you is fueled by chemo litho autotrophy so these kind of alternative Lifestyles and so potentially studying the gypsum and its ability to preserve or not preserve biosignatures is is kind of a novel aspect and gets away from surface world where we sometimes see the signatures mostly of things that are photosynthetic and so in the context of this talk when I'm talking about life detection or I'm talking about signatures I'm talking about lipid biomarkers specifically and so what I'm showing you here are some types of these they were kind of explained earlier these ones on the left which are those hopenoids so these are produced by bacteria and these can be functionalized and then they have this very recalcitrant backbone structure this hoping that is this diagenetic structure that can persist in some terrestrial environments for potentially millions of years and then on the right these are gdgts from archaea so kind of a similar lipid biomarker and the these specific structures that I'm showing you are ones that have been classified from those snodite biofilms that I showed you in their earlier image and so knowing what we already know about these cave systems which is that we have gypsum that is precipitating in in very close association with microbial activity that's kind of these microbes that are using an alternative lifestyle and we know that some of these organisms like that aciditythyl bacillus are capable of producing these lipid biomarkers and this gypsum is kicking around in this cave for a little bit of time we sort of used what we know to form these questions about things that we don't know um we don't actually know or going into the study no one had ever looked at what microbes are colonizing the surface of the gypsum itself and we don't know if those organisms produce their own lipid biomarker Suite if we'll be able to characterize that or detect it in the gypsum at all and then if we do does that persist in this gypsum that has been existing in this cave for a longer period of time and so I won't go into the Weeds on these methods here but I just want to highlight that we're using kind of a few different approaches to answer some of these questions so using some sort of classic molecular biology techniques amplicon sequencing and metagenomics to characterize those microbial communities and then using some organic geochemical techniques to try to characterize those lipid biomarkers and so some of the data that I've had um is that these gypsum surfaces are in fact colonized by microbes and so what I'm showing you here is amplicon sequencing data so that's 16sr in our sequencing that tells us who's there and what I want you to take away from this graph is that I'm plotting two things here on the left to this access and the blue dots is showing the percent of that acid ethyl bacillus so that's that main sulfur at oxidizing bacteria that we see in those snodite biofilms and then on the right I'm showing in this orange I'm showing you the overall diversity of these samples and so all of these dots are gypsum samples that we're taking at kind of varying distances from that active lead degassing sulfate extreme and just a reminder so these biofilms that have been previously characterized are around 70 percent of citythal bacillus and so the main takeaway is that are samples of gypsum are far more diverse than that you know even at this kind of like best case scenario where we're the closest to the sulfate extreme we're really not seeing anywhere near 70 percent of city thal bacillus and so this is data from that other cave that I've studied and I don't have that nice distance gradient but again it's plotting the same things and I've just kind of broadly lumped these samples together in terms of like high level of sulfide medium level lower levels and again we see a similar Trend we also see low levels of acetyl bacillus and in fact we see a heck of a lot of archaea too so some of these samples were almost entirely archaea and why I talk about acetyl bacillus and I talk about the diversity of these samples is that you know we know acetyl bacillus is capable of producing lipid biomarkers but it's one of the bacteria that can and in fact a lot of them can't and so this potentially has implications when we think about you know are there things that is in this gypsum that is producing lipid biomarkers or aren't there and we can kind of get at this um indirectly through metagenomics and so again metagenomics is looking at all of the genes that are present in a particular environmental sample and so far I have only reconstructed a single metagenome and this is from a native sulfur deposit but I did do some Gene searching and I was looking for this squaly and hoping cyclase Gene which forms a critical precursor to making those hopenoid lipid biomarkers and I did find some copies of that but again I also found a ton of archaea and two of the high quality bins that I was able to assemble were these two kind of Novel archaea that have potentially an interesting symbiotic relationship and I would love to talk about that more but that's kind of a whole other talk so I'm just going to leave it at that with this complicated figure here on the right um so it you might be guessing or kind of wondering why I've only gotten one metagenome so far and really it's because the overall biomass in these gypsum samples is very low and so what I'm showing you in this picture here so this is microscopy this is dappy staining so looking at cells and so you see hopefully you can see just a few blue dots those are cells and on the right this is showing them sitting in a in a bathtub full of gypsum micro crystals and so when you just kind of contextualize this low number of cells in in the vast array of all of these minerals there's not a whole lot going on and in fact some of our preliminary total organic carbon measurements are less than one percent or even a fraction of a percent and so that all leads to kind of some complications with trying to actually extract some of these lipid biomarkers and so this side of the project is still an active protocol development we haven't seen anything yet um and so we've had to kind of scale up our extraction we're hoping to extract a lot more gypsum and and I'm hoping that that's something I'll be able to talk about more in the future but I just want to return to sort of The Guiding question of this of this study which is you know looking at these very um interesting microbial Dynamics the way that the stripsum is formed we see a lot of we see biofilms existing where where the gypsum is forming but we don't know if there's biomarkers that are preserved or not and I have to leave that question open at this time um but hopefully I can answer it in the future so I think I will just leave off there and um I wouldn't be able to do this work without I have a lot of very fantastic collaborators and funding sources and I would especially like to thank all the folks at the astrobiology analytical laboratory at Goddard and I think that I have some time for questions so thank you foreign [Applause] hey I'm bunny Chase I'm from the jet propulsion laboratory I really love this question you're asking and like the way that you're trying to attack it and I was wondering a lot of the lipid biomarkers that you talked about looking for they as you said can be preserved for a few millions of years but what about the more stable versions like looking for her pains rather than hope Knowles are you also looking for those yeah yeah we are I didn't really explain that super well but we are hoping to look for helping hoping to look for Hope pains as well yeah um what do you think like the Pres the precious in this cave would be for the molecules and how similar is that to Mars yeah I think that that is kind of the key question for sure um there I don't know if that's something that I want to dive into right now but I think we should talk about it later for sure I'm curious to hear your thoughts on it as well um obviously this is a oxidizing environment it's it's acidic it's wet so it has a lot that could maybe not be preserving things but um you know certainly folks have done similar research and and have found biomarkers in in Gypsum and other environments on Earth so it's a it's a good question any last questions for Zoe okay thank you so much oh wait there's Chad sorry hey so I have a question about the microcrystalline nature of that gypsum so what do you think that might what's your hypothesis for structurally how that might affect preservation of Bio signatures as opposed to other kinds of gypsum that might happen on the surface yeah I think that's a really question um I guess you know off the top of my head I would say that I don't know if we're gonna get it like doesn't really layer I think necessarily in the way that we see in like evaporated gypsum um how that may or may not you know factor into biosignature preservation I don't I can't really speak to that but it is I think it's definitely a really interesting difference um that we see in the strips on for sure and it's like it's I didn't really show any of the like there's that one picture that I showed of the gypsum but it's it's crazy it's like you know we call it Rock in name only um it's it's like goo um you go to sample it and it's almost like a non Newtonian fluid it like just kind of like oozes um which is super wild and and it's kind of difficult to work with to be honest yeah all right thank you so much Zoe [Music]
