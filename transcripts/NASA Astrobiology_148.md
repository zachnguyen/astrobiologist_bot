[Music] good morning everyone um we're at the awesome my name is Andrea Brian I'm a PhD student at University Chicago and today I will talk about investigating the use of long period seismology to explore Titan's interior I'm aware that um I'm actually quite new to seismology myself when we began a couple years ago so I will try to do a little bit of background for everyone all right so starting with Cassini we learned a lot about the saturnian system but especially for this study we learned a lot about Titan and so um there was actually a probe the hoyigan's probe that landed on the surface of Titan and you can if you go on YouTube you can Google it and or you can YouTube it and see the landing um there it's leaning through the haze and you see some water ice Pebbles on the surface um and there's so much I could say about Titan but for the sake of time I'll just say it's an amazing natural astrobiology Laboratory um and um I'm very excited to do some theory about it um okay so here is what we currently know about Titan um and so we know that there is a liquid water ocean underneath um a very thick shell of ice so it's between 50 and 150 kilometers deep um we don't know the exact compositions of this ice shell or the ocean but we do know that there's water there um and also there could be some high pressure ice underneath the ocean and this actually has very big astrobiological implications because it could actually act if there is high pressurized it could act as a barrier from there's the enrichment of the ocean for potential life um if it's there and so um yeah so that's something that seismology can help us to constrain whether or not that's there um okay so this brings me to NASA dragonfly and to dragonfly um is a rotor craft that will launch in 2027 um and it'll take about six years or so to get to Titan um but this instrument will be loaded with many many different instrument packages that are really there's a very large Focus for Astro bio and in particularly the seismometer um which is going to be on the other Underside you can see here it's like dangling or it's up under the rotocraft but it's going to be tethered it's tethered and so it'll be lowered down at each location on Titan that's going to visit and then measure the seismic activity there and there also these geophones which are essentially less sensitive seismometers and they're a bit smaller that are going to be there's two under the underside of the skids and so in particular the seismometer the geophones and other instruments within the this drag map package are going to be looking to measure habitability okay so um dragonfly says melody seismology in a nutshell will help us to constrain the interior structure of Titan more precisely and so seismology um similarly like on Earth has helped us to understand more about the actual interior of Earth um to like very great detail and so we hope to be able to do a bit of the same um on Titan and so some possible causes of Titan Quakes will be tidal flexing or Quail volcanoes and then also like ice cracking events of various kinds and this is of course not a non exhaustive list and so we'll be able to put like very precise um more precise hopefully measurements on what's actually going on there okay so now this brings me to the namesake of this talk long period seismology so um I'm talking about so if you're familiar with seismograms we have the Body Waves or those are the p waves compressive waves and the sheer waves S waves and then we have um later on we have these long these surface waves and so I'm looking as opposed to using Body Waves investigating um and particularly with these I'm looking at methane cloth rate models what if I were to use the surface wave information particularly dispersion information to be able to try to learn about Titan and maybe about the eyeshadow thickness so let's see what I found okay so starting with methane clathrates um I for those of you don't know what that is um so a clothway is essentially I like to say a water cage and so you can see um I don't know if you can see those um this is essentially um a structure of water molecules around and they're entrapping a single molecule and and the case of or in my the study the molecule we're looking at would be methane okay so imagine there's this molecule and now we have tens of kilometers of this these methane clathrates and we think that this could be very possible and very plausible for the Titan for Titan conditions um and I think I forgot to mention Titan surface is 94 Kelvin so on the surface methane we have a hydrological cycle but it's a methane hydrological cycle um six percent or five or six percent of the atmosphere is methane um and so we have instead of lakes of water lakes of hydrocarbons um and lakes of methane um so um when we have this liquid methane and ice under Titan temperatures and pressures they will readily form these methane clathrates and it's been shown in the laboratory so it's thought that they're most likely will be lots of these methane clathrates on Titan um and so the models that we considered um were essentially they were all the same so we were looking at 100 kilometer thick ice shell and just varying the um the clathrated lid thickness so um the cloth grades were just at the surface so hence the cloth rate lid um and um yeah these are all spherically symmetric models they were generated with an open source code called Planet profile if you're interested in generating this it's on GitHub also you can I couldn't show you how to get it or you can just Google it um and there's a ton of other bodies you can look at there as well and so we simulated a magnitude 3 quick and then these were the data that we'll be looking at come from a three kilometer Source step so three kilometers deep within the ice Okay so so um the from the study um I this was led by Angela marusiak at um who is now professor at University of Arizona uh and so we actually saw some small differences in dispersion between two of the models in particular that we're looking at and in that paper so that was the 10 kilometer cloth rate lid and the um pure water is shell and so just for this is a primer about dispersion it's related to the material properties of the ice shell and particularly in the case of elastic waves that we're looking at here and so this wave speed depends on frequency and that's kind of like the meat of what dispersion is is seeing how the wave speed or the group velocities they change as a function of frequency and so we saw like about two percent difference a two percent difference between the dispersion so that's looking at this group velocity curve here it's very small differences but they're small enough that if you have a really high Precision seismometer you could actually detect that which is actually I found that quite intriguing so I was like well let's dig deeper and see what else we can find um so this brings me to the setup of the um on the project of this long period study that I'm leading now so um I take theoretical dispersion curves so it's all theoretical but these are extra theoretical um and I can explain what that means later um or if you if you ask um so theoretical this version curve they're generated with a code called mineos and elaborate on that and then take these other axi Simmons it says that's another code so the different methods of doing these things um seismograms to create these mock observational data of which I would go and pick and calculate by hand um and with a computer the group velocities for each Titan input model I'm not sure that I'm across a range of distances um and frequencies so um now just I'll talk about the theoretical group velocities um and so these are looking at group velocity as a functional frequency so group velocity on the y axis and frequency on the X axes and I'm looking at different modes so I'll talk about what the screw velocities and phase velocities are and or group velocities are and then what the modes are um so group velocity um if we were to look if you look on the right hand side it's um the the actual velocity of the like wave packet that's encapsulating the like more the bigger larger scale structure of our seismograms and the phase velocities that's another measure of dispersion um it is the actual velocity of the Peaks and so when you have the groove velocity not equal to the phase velocity you you know you have a dispersive wave um and so um the terminal information so mode so if if you remember from physics the like wave on the string analogy um or it's not analogy but the wave on a string representation of modes um the fundamental modes will be here there's no node first overturn one node second third second and two and three nodes uh accordingly or respectively and then you can go all the way up to I mean as many nodes and modes as you'd like to um so for this study we actually looked at up to three thousand uh overtones to create an entire seismogram but here um we know that most of the information of this surface wave that we're looking at and I forgot to mention that it's a Rayleigh wave um it was it would normally be in the fundamental mode but um there's a surprise that I'll show you in the next slide um and so essentially what we found was that when we're comparing um when we're looking at the data and I I went and used actually some this other data set um and took the seismograms themselves and um calculated the group velocities as opposed to just them being spit out from a code for me um consistently that um the dispersion profiles um there when we look at the different interior structures they do like differ slightly but then when we lay them on top of each other essentially like there isn't various little differences and it's so small that you probably would not and not probably wouldn't they would be smaller than what we could observe on Titan um so and then also the Israeli waves we thought that they would be the information would be in the fundamental mode but actually it was in the first overtone which is a little interesting and it's consistently so that okay so there's this yellow line is the first overtone and so this blue little Cloud thing is the one Sigma standard deviation from these group velocity measurements which are taken over a range of just instances and frequencies um and so um yeah it's it's a pretty pretty strong uh thing that's happening or signal that we're seeing for it not being and the fundamental mode um and so then that just shows that this method um we wouldn't be able to use Body Waves to um this sorry the surface wave this particular surface wave as um to diagnose the thickness of Titan's eyeshadow so that's intriguing and so um I will dig deeper and and see um more about that in the future all right so a quick summary I use data driven models of Titan's Interiors or to compute Titan synthetic seismograms for comparison to real data that we'll get from dragonfly in the mid 2030s and in the study we investigate energy chat trapped in the eye shell to determine the structure of Titan and the presence of surface clathrates um and AKA long period seismology And while the surface waves observation that we saw in the study do not clearly determine thickness we can constrain it using body wave arrivals so P and S waves and if you're interested in learning more about isolation seismology and particularly about some of the methodology that we were implementing talk to me or also consult Simon staler's paper uh it's very looking also at other icy ocean worlds as well and then understanding the composition of Titan's interior especially the ice shell and ocean will have important implications for astrobiology and habitability studies so thank you so much [Music] all right yes good hi nice talk um so presumably like in the lab we don't have like kilometers of class rates so what does it take to extrapolate from just this lab made amount to how it'll behave when it's this much um as a medium yeah so we use this paper called by calasova and soton I think it's in like 20 20. um but that was their paper is where we got the actual thermal um thermal models to model to model this for the cloth rates yeah thank you for the talk um I I have a question that may be outside of the scope of what you do but um I know that the eye shelf thickness can be a proxy for for heat loss and that can also kind of um uh provide clues as to whether the ocean may be like a transient feature like a more long lived feature is that anything you can determine using the data that may be collected by dragonfly or anything like that or is that outside of the scope of because I mean the the longevity of the ocean like if there is like a like a liquid water ocean um beneath the ice layers that could have implications in the habitability whether it's like persisted over geologic time scales yeah I mean I mean we can constrain the with just what size seismology the composition and the depth but regarding yeah it's a little bit outside of my preview uh okay I apologize no it's okay yeah uh so I'm curious um what is the amount of confidence we have that there's a high pressure ice layer on the bottom instead of you know a direct contact with the ocean yeah I mean we don't have like any confidence to say I mean um we think that there could be um I think there's definitely a big Camp thinking there is um but it's highly debatable so if I were to like look at that diagram um I could put a big sorry going way back um there um for the high pressure eyes you could put like a big question mark there because we don't know if it's there we don't know how thick it is it's like really deep down we know there's no molten core in Titan from some Casini measurements but high pressure rise we have a zero idea um but it could be there um and so especially because it's so cold but then yeah and if it is there there's different scenarios also that if we have porous high pressure eyes and it's really saline and then it could still um we could still have some enrichment of the ocean so even if it is there depending on its composition they could still be enrichment of the ocean um so it may not necessarily be a barrier to life also if it is there thank you yeah hi nice talk I would like to ask you if you have considered the influenza of the titleistic patient in your models always the title dissipation oh do I incorporate that if you have considered that influence in the generation of a Titan earthquake Titan Quake sorry so have you considered the influenza of the tidal dissipation um no we're not considering tidal dissipation um in the models or we're assuming it's a very perfect Titan but I also don't think um we're assuming we're considering attenuation within the ice shell but title dissipation um we're not really thinking about I think and I don't think we need to yeah that that um about earthquake if you um synthesize the sex meet analysis and the influencing of the television so um I don't know how much is a contribution of the Titan so that's why I am asking you if you have considered this um we haven't considered this parameter in your mother yeah I don't know if it has like a huge um so so the title I don't think I will have uh like a large effect which is why we've left it out yeah yeah also that bang of the distance between the Titan and sat or so yeah I don't know that's why I was asking you yeah thank you so much yeah one more question so uh um I'm not a planetary geologist but I I do know that one of the limitations for our understanding of the interior of Mars with the Insight mission was that we only had a single seismometer yeah um in your data are you modeling uh basically seismology being measured by a single seismometer and you think having multiple seismometers on the surface of Titan would give you further resolution in terms of the thickness of methane clathrate lid yeah 100 it would be amazing to have multiple seismometers on Mars also on Titan but I think just with experimental Mission constraints like they can only have one have you done any modeling to see if you could get further resolution with multiple seismometers um so it's not so it's not really about like getting the resolution with um so we can generate perfect seismograms um it's just how well we'll be able to see and detect um things I see it's easier to like triangulate events and things with um when you have multiple seismometers um but yeah we can essentially if we we could see like deeper events if we have more seismometers we'd have just greater sensitivity overall um but we unfortunately don't have that yeah so we have to do what we can with one thank you Andrea yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music]
