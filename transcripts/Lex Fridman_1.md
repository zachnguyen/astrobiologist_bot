  So you have an original life event. It evolves for 4 billionyears, at least on our planet. It evolves a technosphere. The technologies themselves start having this property we call life, which is the phase we're undergoing now. It solves the origin of itself, and then it figures outhow that process all works, understands how to make more life and then can copy itselfonto another planet, so the whole structurecan reproduce itself.   The following is aconversation with Sara Walker, her third time in this podcast. She is an astrobiologistand theoretical physicist, interested in the origin of life and in discovering alienlife on other worlds. She has written an amazingnew upcoming book titled, "Life as No One Knows It: ThePhysics of Life's Emergence." This book is coming out on August 6th, so please go pre order it now. It will blow your mind. This is a Lex Fridman podcast, to support it, please check out oursponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Sara Walker. You open the book, "Lifeas No One Knows It: The Physics of Life's Emergence," with the distinctionbetween the materialists and the vitalists. So what's the difference?Can you maybe define the two?   I think the question there is about whether life can bedescribed in terms of matter and you know, physical things, or whether there is some other feature, that's not physical, thatactually animates living things. So for a long time peoplemaybe have called that a soul. It's been really hard topin down what that is. So I think the vitalistidea is really that, it's kind of a dualistic interpretation, that there's sort ofthe material properties, but there's somethingelse that animates life that is there when you're alive and it's not there when you're dead. And materialists kind of don't think that there's anything really special about the matter of life and the material substratesthat life is made out of. So they disagree on somereally fundamental points.   Is there a gray area between the two? Like maybe all there is is matter, but there's so much we don't know that it might as well be magic? (Sara laughs) That like whatever thatmagic that the vitalists see. Meaning like   Yeah.   There's just so much mystery that it's really unfairto say that it's boring and understood, and as simpleas quote unquote "physics."   Yeah, I think the entireuniverse is just a giant mystery. I guess that's whatmotivates me as a scientist. And so oftentimes whenI look at open problems like the nature of life or consciousness, or you know, what is intelligence? Or are there souls? Or whatever question that we have, that we feel like we aren't even on the tip of answering yet. I think, you know, wehave a lot more work to do to really understand theanswers to these questions. So it's not magic, it's just the unknown. And I think a lot of the history of humans coming to understand the world around us has been taking ideas thatwe once thought were magic or supernatural, and really understandingthem in a much deeper way, that we learn what those things are, and they still have an air of mystery even when we understand them. There's no sort of bottomto our understanding.   So do you think thevitalists have a point, that they're more eager and able to notice the magic of life?   I think that no tradition,vitalists included, is ever fully wrong about the nature of the thingsthat they're describing. So a lot of times whenI look at different ways that people have describedthings across human history, across different cultures, there's always a seed of truth in them, and I think it's really importantto try to look for those, because if there are narratives that humans have been telling ourselves for thousands of years, forthousands of generations, there must be some truth to them. You know, we've beenlearning about reality for a really long time, and we recognize the patternsthat reality presents us, we don't always understandwhat those patterns are. And so I think it's really important to pay attention to that. So I don't think thevitalists were actually wrong, and a lot of what Italk about in the book, but also I think about alot just professionally, is the nature of ourdefinitions of what's material, and how science has come toinvent the concept of matter. And that some of those thingsactually really are inventions that happened in a particular time, in a particular technology that could learn about certain patterns and help us understand them, and that there are some patternswe still don't understand. And if we knew how to measure those things or we knew how to describethem in a more rigorous way, we would realize that thematerial world, matter, has more properties thanwe thought that it did. And one of those might be associated with the thing that we call life. Life could be a material property and still have a lot of the features that the vitaliststhought were mysterious.   So we may still expand our understanding what is incorporated inthe category of matter that will eventuallyincorporate such magical things that the vitalists have noticed    Yeah   Like life.   Yeah, so I think about... I always like to useexamples from physics, so I'll probably do that to, (laughs) Like it's my go to place. But you know, in the historyof gravitational physics, for example, in the history of motion, you know like when Aristotle came up with his theories of motion, he did it by the materialproperties he thought things had. So there was a concept ofthings falling to Earth because they were solid like, and things raising to theheavens 'cause they were airlike, and things moving around the planet 'cause they were celestial like. But then we came to realizethat thousands of years later and after the inventionof many technologies that allowed us to actually measure time in a mechanistic way andtrack planetary motion, and we could, you know, rollballs down inclined planes and track that progress. We realized that if wejust talked about mass and acceleration, we couldunify all motion in the universe in a really simple description. So we didn't really haveto worry about the fact that my cup is heavy and the air is light, like the same laws describe them, if we have the right materialproperties to talk about what those laws areactually interacting with. And so I think the issue with life is, we don't know how tothink about information in a material way. And so we haven't been ableto build a unified description of what life is or the kind of thingsthat evolution builds, because we haven't really invented the right material concept yet.   So when talking about motion, the laws of physics appear to be the same everywhere out in the universe. You think the same is truefor other kinds of matter that we might eventually include life in?   I think life obeys universal principles. I think there is some deepunderlying exploratory framework that will tell us about thenature of life in the universe and will allow us to identify life that we can't yet recognizebecause it's too different.   You write about theparadox of defining life. Why does this seem to be so easy and so complicated at the same time?   You know, all the sortof classic definitions people want to use just don't work. They don't work in all cases. So Carl Sagan had this wonderful essay on definitions of life, where I think he talks about aliens coming from another planet, If they saw Earth, they might think that carswere the dominant life form because there's so manyof them on our planet, and like humans are inside them, and you might wanna exclude machines, but any definition, you know, like classic biology textbook definitions would also include them. And so, you know, hewanted to draw a boundary between these kind of thingsby trying to exclude them, but they were naturally included by the definitions people wanna give. And in fact, what he ended up pointing out is that all of the definitionsof life that we have, whether it's, life is aself reproducing system, or life eats to survive, or life requirescompartments, whatever it is, there's always a counter example that challenges that definition. This is why viruses are sohard or why fire is so hard. And so we've had a really hard time trying to pin down, from adefinitional perspective, exactly what life is.   Yeah, you actually bringup the zombie ant fungus. I enjoyed looking at this thing, (Sara laughs)as an example of one of the challenges. You mentioned viruses,but this is a parasite. Look at that.   Did you see this in jungle?  In fact, ants... Actually one of the interestingthings about the jungle, that everything is ephemeral. Like everything eatseverything really quickly. So if an organism dies,that organism disappears.   Yeah.  It's a machine that doesn't have... I wanted to say it doesn'thave a memory or a history, which is interestinggiven your work on history in defining a living being. The jungle forgets very quickly. It wants to erase the factthat you existed very quickly.   Yeah, but it can't erase it,it's just restructuring it. And I think the other thingthat is really, you know, vivid to me about thisexample that you're giving is, how much death is necessary for life. So I worry a bit aboutnotions of immortality and whether immortalityis a good thing or not. So I have sort of a broad conception that life is the only thingthe universe generates that actually has even thepotential to be immortal. But that's as like the sort of process that you're describing, where life is about memoryand historical contingency, and construction of new possibilities. But when you look at any instance of life, especially one as dynamicas what you're describing, it's a constant birth and death process. But that birth and death process is like, the way that the universe can explore what possibilities can exist, and not everything, notevery possible human or every possible ant orevery possible zombie ant or every possible tree will ever live. So it's, you know, it'san incredibly dynamic and creative placebecause of all that death.   So does this thing... This is a parasite that needs the ant. So is this a living thing or is this not a living thing? So this is    Yeah, so   It just pierces the ant. I mean it   Right.   And I've seen a lot of this by the way, organisms working together in the jungle, like ants protecting adelicious piece of fruit. So they need the fruit. But like if you touch that fruit, they're going to like... The forces emerge.   Yeah.  They're fighting you, they're defending that fruit.   Right.  To the death. Nature seems to findmutual benefits, right?   Yeah, it does. I think the thing that's perplexing for me about these kind of examples is, you know, effectively the ant's deadbut it's staying alive now 'cause it's piloted by this fungus. And so that gets back to this, you know, thing that we're talkingabout a few minutes ago about how the boundary oflife is really hard to define. So you know, anytime thatyou wanna draw a boundary around something and you say, "This feature is the thingthat makes this alive," or "This thing is alive on its own," there's not ever really a clear boundary, and these kind of examples arereally good at showing that, because it's like the thingthat you would've thought is the living organism is now dead, except that it has another living organism that's piloting it. So the two of them togetherare alive in some sense, but they're, you know, now in this kind of weirdsymbiotic relationship that's taking this ant to its death.   So what do you do with that in terms of when you try to define life?   I think we have to get rid of the notion of an individual as being relevant. And this is really difficult because you know, a lot of the ways that we think about life, like the fundamentalunit of life is the cell, individuals are alive, but we don't think about howgray that distinction is. So for example, you might consider, you know, self reproduction to be the most defining featureof life, a lot of people do. Actually like it's, you know, one of these standarddifferent definitions that a lot of peoplein my field like to use in astrobiology is, life is a self sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution. Which I was once quoted as agreeing with, and I was really offended,because I hate that definition. I think it's terrible, and I think it's terriblethat people use it. I think like every word in that definition is actually wrong as a descriptor of life.   Life is a self sustainingchemical system capable of Darwinian evolution. Why is that... That seems like a pretty good definition.   Yeah, I know. If you wanna make me angryyou can pretend I said that, (Sara laughs) and believed it.   So self sustaining chemical system, Darwinian evolution. What is self sustaining?What's so frustrating? I mean which aspect is frustrating to you, but it's also, those arevery interesting words.   Yeah, they're all interesting words and you know, togetherthey sound really smart and they sound like theybox in what life is. But you can use any ofthe words individually and you can come up with counter examples that don't fulfill that property. The self sustaining oneis really interesting, thinking about humans, right? Like we're not self sustaining, we're dependent on societies. And so, you know, I findit paradoxical that, you know, it might be that societies, because they are self sustaining units, are now more alive than individuals are. And that could be the case. But I still think we have some property associated with life. I mean that's the thing thatwe're trying to describe. So that one's quite hard. And in general, you know, no organism is really self sustaining. They always require an environment. So being self sustainingis coupled, in some sense, to the world around you. We don't live in a vacuum, so that part's already challenging, and then you can go to chemical system. I don't think that's good either. I think there's a confusion because life emerges inchemistry, that life is chemical. I don't think life is chemical. I think life emerges in chemistry because chemistry is the firstthing the universe builds where it cannot exhaustall the possibilities, because the combinatorial spaceof chemistry is too large.   Well but is it possible to have a life that is not a chemical system?   Yes.   Well, there's a guy Iknow named Lee Cronin, he's been on the podcast a couple times. He just got really pissed off   I know that guy too    Listening to this. (laughs)  What a coincidence. He probably just got reallypissed off hearing that. For people who somehowdon't know, he's a chemist.   Yeah, but he wouldagree with that statement.   Would he? I don't think he would. I don't think he would. He would broaden thedefinition of chemistry until it'll include everything.   Oh sure.  Okay, so you're    Or maybe, I don't know,  But wait, but you said that universe, the first thing it creates is chemistry.   Very precisely, it's not the first thing it creates, obviously like, it hasto make atoms first, but it's the first thing, like if you think about, you know, the universe originated, atoms were made in, you know,Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and then later in stars,and then planets formed, and planets become engines of chemistry. They start exploring whatkind of chemistry is possible. And the combinatorial spaceof chemistry is so large that even on every planetin the entire universe, you will never expressevery possible molecule. I like this exampleactually that Lee gave me, which is to think about Taxol, it has a molecular weight of about 853. It's got, you know, a lot of atoms but it's not astronomically large. And if you try to make one molecule with that molecular formula in every three dimensionalshape you could make with that molecular formula, it would fill 1.5 universes in volume. So with one unique molecule,that's just one molecule. So chemical space is huge, and I think it's reallyimportant to recognize that, because if you wanna ask a question of, why does life emerge in chemistry? Well life emerges in chemistry because life is the physicsof how the universe selects what gets to exist. And those things get created along historically contingentpathways and memory and all the other stuffthat we can talk about. But the universe has to actually make historically contingentchoices in chemistry, 'cause it can't exhaustall possible molecules.   What kind of things can you create that's outside the combinatorialspace of chemistry? That's what I'm trying to understand    Oh, if it's not chemical. So I think some of the things that have evolved on our biosphere, I would call as much aliveas chemistry, as a cell, but they seem much more abstract. So for example, I think language is alive. I think, or at least life. I think memes are. I think   You're saying language is life?   Yes.  Language is alive. Oh boy, I'm gonna haveto explore that one. (Sara laughs) Okay, but   Life, maybe not alive, but I don't... Actually, I don't know whereI stand exactly on that. I've been thinking about thata little bit more lately. But mathematics too, and it's interesting, 'cause people think that mathhas this platonic reality that exists outside of our universe. And I think it's afeature of our biosphere, and it's telling us something about the structure of ourselves. And I find that really interesting, 'cause when you would sort of internalize all of these things thatwe noticed about the world and you start asking, "Well,what do these look like if I was, you know,something outside of myself, observing these systemsthat all embedded in, what would that structure look like?" And I think we look really different than the way that we talk about what we look like to each other.   What do you think aliving organism in math is? Is it one axiomatic system or is it individual theorems or is it    I think it's the fact thatit's open ended in some sense. It's another open endedcombinatorial space. And the recursive properties of it allow creativity to happen. Which is what you see with, you know, like the revolution in the last century with Godel's theoremand Turing and you know, there's clear places where mathematics noticesholes in the universe.   So it seems like you're sneaking up on a different kind of definition of life. Open ended, large combinatorial space.   Yeah.  Room for creativity.   Definitely not chemical. I mean chemistry is one substrate.  Restrict to chemical.   Yeah.  Chemical. Okay, what about the third thing, which I think would be the hardest, 'cause you probably likeit the most, is evolution or selection.   Well, specificallyit's Darwinian evolution.   Darwinian, okay.  And I think Darwinian evolution is a problem. But the reason that thatdefinition is a problem is not because evolutionis in the definition, but because the implicationis that, you know, that most people would wanna make is that an individual is alive. And the evolutionary process, at least the Darwinianevolutionary process and most evolutionary processes, they don't happen at thelevel of individuals, they happen at the level of population. So again, you would be saying something, like what we saw with theself sustaining definition, which is that populations are alive, but individuals aren't, because populations evolveand individuals don't. And obviously like maybe you are alive because you know, your gutmicrobiome is evolving. But Lex as an entityright now is not evolving by canonical theories of evolution. In assembly theory, which is attempting to explain life, evolution is a much broader thing, so    So an individual organism can evolve under assembly theory.   Yes, you're constructingyourself all the time. Assembly theory is about construction and how the universeselects for things to exist.   What if you reformulate everything? Like a population isa living organism, so    That's fine too.  Right.   But this again gets back to... So I think what all of the... You know, like we cannitpick at definitions. I don't think it's likeincredibly helpful to do it. But the reason for me   It's fun.   Yeah, it is fun. It is really fun. And actually I do think it's useful, in the sense that when you see the ways that they all break down, you either have to keep forcing in, your like sort of conceptionof life you want to have, or you have to say, "All these definitions arebreaking down for a reason. Maybe I should adopt amore expansive definition that encompasses all the thingsthat I think and our life." And so for me, I think life is the process of how information structuresmatter over time and space, and an example of life iswhat emerges on a planet and yields an open ended cascadeof generation of structure and increasing complexity, and this is the thing that life is. And any individual isjust a particular instance of these lineages that are, you know, structured across time. And so we focus so muchon these individuals that are these short temporal moments in this larger causal structure that actually is the life on our planet. And I think that's why thesedefinitions break down, because they're not general enough, they're not universal enough,they're not deep enough, they're not abstract enough to actually capture that regularity.   Because we're focused onthat little ephemeral thing.   Yeah, it's like   That we call human life?   Aristotle focusing on, you know, heavy things fallingbecause they're earth like, and you know, things floating'cause they're airlike, it's the wrong thing to focus on.   So what exactly are we missing by focusing on such a short span of time?   I think we're missingmost of what we are. So one of the issues, I've been thinking about this like really viscerally lately, it's weird when you dotheoretical physics, because I think it like literally changes the structure of your brain, (laughs) and you see the world differently, especially when you're tryingto build new abstractions.   Do you think it's possible, if you're a theoretical physicist, that like it's easy to fall off the cliff and go descend into madness?   I mean I think you'realways on the edge of it, but I think what is amazingabout being a scientist and trying to do things rigorously,is it keeps your sanity. So I think if I wasn'ta theoretical physicist, I would be probably not sane, but what it forces youto do is hold the... Like you have to holdyourself to the fire of like, these abstractions in my mind have to really correspond to reality, and I have to reallytest that all the time. And so I love building new abstractions and I love going to thoselike incredibly creative, you know, spaces that people don't see as part of the way that weunderstand the world now. But ultimately, I have to make sure that whatever I'm pulling from that space is something that's really usable and really like relates tothe world outside of me. That's what science is.   So we were talking about what we're missing when welook at a small stretch of time in a small stretch of space.   Yeah. So the issue is, we evolve perception to see reality a certain way, right? So for us, space is really important and time feels fleeting and I, you know, I had a really wonderfulmentor, Paul Davies, most of my career. And Paul's amazing becausehe gives these like little seed thoughtexperiments all the time. Like, you know, somethinghe used to ask me all the time when I was a postdoc, this is kind of a random tangent, but was like, you know,how much of the universe could be converted into technology? If you were thinking about like, you know, long term futures and stuff like that. And it's like a weird thought experiment but like, there's a lotof deep things there. But I do think a lot about the fact that, we're really limited in ourinteractions with reality by the particulararchitectures that we evolved, and so we're not seeing everything. And in fact our technologytells us this all the time because it allows us tosee the world in new ways by basically allowingus to perceive the world in ways that we couldn't otherwise. And so what I'm getting at with this is, I think that livingobjects are actually huge. Like there're some ofthe biggest structures in the universe, but theyare not big in space, they're big in time. And we actually can'tresolve that feature. We don't interact withit on a regular basis. So we see them as these fleeting things that have this reallyshort temporal clock time without seeing how large they are. When I'm saying time here, I really like the way thatpeople could picture it is in terms of causal structure. So if you think about thehistory of the universe to get to you, and you imagine that thatentire history is you, that is the picture I have in my mind when I look at every living thing.   So you have a tweet for everything. (Sara laughs)You tweeted    Doesn't everyone?   You have a lot ofpoetic, profound tweets. Sometimes   Thank you.   They're puzzles that takea long time to figure out.   Well you know what the trick is, the reason they're hard to write is because it's compressinga very deep idea into a short amount of space, and I really like doingthat intellectual exercise, 'cause I find it productive for me.   Yeah, it's a veryinteresting kind of compression algorithm though.   Yeah, I like language. I think it's really fun to play with.   Yeah, I wonder if AI can decompress it. That'd be interesting    I would like to try this, but I think I use language in certain ways that are non canonical, andI do it very purposefully, and it would be interesting tome how AI would interpret it.   Yeah, your tweets wouldbe a good Turing test.   There you go.  For a super intelligence. Anyway, you tweeted that,"Things only look emergent because we can't see time. So if we could see time, whatwould the world look like?" You're saying you wouldbe able to see everything that an object has been, every step of the way thatled to this current moment, and all the interactions that are required to make that evolution happen. You would see this gigantic tale.   The universe is far largerin time than it is in space.   Yeah.  And this planet is one of the biggestthings in the universe.   Oh, so the more complexity, the bigger    Yeah, so like the technosphere, I think the modern technosphere is the largest object in time in the universe that we know about.   And when you saytechnosphere, what do you mean?   I mean the global integration of life and technology on this planet.   So all the things, all the technologicalthings we've created?   Mm hmm, but I don'tthink of them as separate. They're like very integrated with the structure that generated them. So you can almost imagine it, like time is constantly bifurcating, and it's generating new structures, and these new structures are, you know, locally constructing the future. And so things like you and I are very close together in time, 'cause we didn't diverge like very early in the history ofuniverse, it's very recent. And I think this is one of the reasons that we can understand each other so well and we can communicate effectively. And I might have some sense ofwhat it feels like to be you, but you know, otherorganisms bifurcated from us in time earlier, this is just the conceptof phylogeny, right? But if you take that deeper and you really think about that as the structure of thephysics that generates life, and you take that very seriously, all of that causation is still bundled up in the objects we observe today. And so you and I are are closein this temporal structure, but we're also... And we're so closebecause we're really big, and we only are very different in sort of like the mostrecent moments in the time that's like embedded in us. It's hard to use words to visualize what's in minds. (laughs) I have such a hard timewith this sometimes. I'm like, I like... I actually was thinkingon the way over here, I was like, you know, youhave pictures in your brain and then they're hard to put into words, but I realized I alwayssay I have a visual, but it's not actually I have a visual. It's, I have a feeling, 'cause oftentimes I cannotactually draw a picture in my mind for the things that I say, but sometimes they go through a picture before they get to words, but I like experimenting with words because I think they help paint pictures.   Yeah, it's again, somekind of compressed feeling that you can query to get a sense of the bigger visualization that you have in mind.   Yeah.  It's just like a really nice compression. But I think the idea of this object that in it contains all theinformation about the history of an entity that you see now, just trying to visualizethat is pretty cool.   Yeah.  I mean obviously the mind breaks downquickly as you step seconds and minutes back in time.  Yeah, for sure   I guess it's just a gigantic object    Yeah.  What you're supposed to be thinking about.   Yeah, I think so, and I think this is one of the reasons that we have such an abilityto abstract as humans, because we are so gigantic, that like the spacethat we can go back into is really large. So like the more abstract you're going, like the deeper you'regoing in that space.   But in that sense, aren't wefundamentally all connected?   Yes, and this is whythe definition of life cannot be the individual, it has to be these lineages, because they're allconnected, they're interwoven, and they're exchanging parts all the time.   Yeah, so maybe there's certainaspects of those lineages that can be lifelike, theycan be characteristics, they can be measured like withassembly theory that have    Yeah.  More or less life, but they're all just fingertips of a    Yeah.  Of a much bigger object.   Yeah, I think life isvery high dimensional. And in fact I think you canbe alive in some dimensions and not in others. Like if you couldproject all the causation that's in you in somefeatures of you, you know, very little causation is required,like very little history, and in some features a lot is. So it's quite difficult to take this really highdimensional, very deep structure, and project it into thingsthat we really can understand and say like, "This is theone thing that we're seeing," because it's not one thing.   It's funny, we're talking about this now and I'm slowly starting to realize, one of the things I sawwhen I took ayahuasca, afterwards actually, so the actual ceremonyis four or five hours, but afterwards you're still riding whatever the thing that you're riding. And I got a chance to, afterwards, hang out with some friends and just shoot the shit inthe, you know, in the forest. And I get to see their faces. And what was happening with their faces and their hair is, I wouldget this interesting effect. First of all, everything was beautiful and I just had so much love for everybody. But I could see their pastselves like behind them. It was this effect where... I guess it's a blurring effect? Of where like if I move like this, the faces that were justthere are still there and it would just float like this, behind them, which willcreate this incredible effect. But it's also another wayto think about that is, I'm visualizing a littlebit of that object, of the thing they werejust a few seconds ago.   Yeah.  It's a cool little effect.   That's very cool.   And now it's like givingit a bit more profundity to the effect that was justbeautiful aesthetically, but it's also beautifulfrom a physics perspective, because that is a past self. I get a little glimpse at the past selves that they were, but then you take that to its natural conclusion,not just a few seconds ago, but just to the beginning of the universe, and you can probably get to that   Yeah, billions of years, yeah.  Get down that lineage.   It's crazy thatthere's billions of years inside all of us.   All of us.  Yeah.   And then we connect obviously.   Yeah.  Not too long ago.   Yeah.   You mentioned just the technosphere and you also wrote that, "The most alive thing on this planet is our technosphere."   Yeah.  Why is the technology we create a kind of life form? Why are you seeing it as life?   Because it's creative, but with us obviously, likenot independently of us, and also because of thissort of lineage view of life, and I think about life often as a planetary scale phenomena, 'cause that's sort of the natural boundary for all of this causation that's bundled in every object in our biosphere. And so for me, it's justsort of the current boundary of how far life on our planet has pushed into the things that ouruniverse can generate. And so it's the furthestthing, it's the biggest thing. And I think a lot about the nature of life across different scales. And so, you know, we have cellsinside of us that are alive and we feel like we're alive, but we don't often thinkabout the societies that we're embedded in as alive or a global scale organization of us and our technology on the planet as alive. But I think if you have this deeper view into the nature of life, which I think is necessary alsoto solve the origin of life, then you have to include those things.   All of them. So you have to simultaneously think about    Every scale  Life at every single scale.   Yeah.  The planetary and the bacteria level.   Yeah, this is the hard thing about solving the problem of life, I think, is how many things you have to integrate into building a sort of a unified picture of this thing that we wanna call life, and a lot of our theories of physics are built on building deep regularities that explain a reallybroad class of phenomenon. And I think we haven'treally traditionally thought about life thatway, but I think to get at some of these hardest questions, like looking for life on other planets or the origin of life, you really have tothink about it that way. And so most of like my professional work is just trying to understandlike every single thing on this planet that mightbe an example of life, which is pretty much everything, and then trying to figure out like, what's the deeperstructure underlying that.   Yeah, Schrodinger wrote that, "Living matter, while noteluding the laws of physics as established up to date, is likely to involve other laws of physics hitherto unknown." So to him    I love that quote.   There was a sense that, at the bottom of thisare new laws of physics that could explain thisthing that we call life.   Yeah, Schrodinger really tried to do what physicists try to do, which is explain things, and his attempt was to try to explain life in terms of non equilibrium physics, because he thought thatwas the best description that we could generate at the time. And so he did come up withsomething really insightful, which was to predict the structure of DNA as an aperiodic crystal. And that was for a veryprecise reason that, you know, that was the only kindof physical structure that could encode enough information to actually specify a cell. We knew some things aboutgenes, but not about DNA and its actual structurewhen he proposed that. But in the book he tried to explain, life is kind of going against entropy. And so some people talked about it as like Schrodinger's paradox, how can life persist when the second law ofthermodynamics is there? But in open systemsthat's not so problematic. And really, the question is, why can life generate so much order? And we don't have aphysics to describe that. And it's interesting, you know, generations of physicists havethought about this problem. Oftentimes it's likewhen people are retiring, they're like, "Oh, nowI can work on life." Or they're like moresenior in their career and they worked on othermore traditional problems. And there's still a lot ofimpetus in the physics community to think that non equilibriumphysics will explain life, but I think that's not the right approach. I don't think ultimately the solution to what life is is there, and I don't really thinkentropy has much to do with it unless it's entirely reformulated.   Well, because you have toexplain how interesting order, how complexity emerges from the soup.   Yes, from randomness.   From randomness. Physics currently can't do that.   No, Physics hardly even acknowledges that the universe is randomat its base. (laughs) We like to think we livein a deterministic universe and everything's deterministic. But I think that's probably, you know, an artifact of the waythat we've written down laws of physics since Newtoninvented modern physics and his conception of motionand gravity, which, you know, he formulated laws thathad initial conditions and fixed dynamical laws, and that's sort ofbecome the standard canon of how people think the universe works and how we need to describeany physical system, is with an initial conditionand a law of motion. And I think that's not actually the way the universe really works. I think it's a good approximationfor the kind of systems that physicists have studied so far. And I think it will radically fail in the long term at describing reality at its more basal levels, but I'm not saying there's a base, I don't think that reality has a ground and I don't think there'sa theory of everything, but I think there are better theories, and I think there aremore explanatory theories, and I think we can get to something that explains much more thanthe current laws of physics do.   When you say theory of everything, you mean like everything, everything.   Yeah, you know, likein physics right now, it's really popular to talkabout theories of everything. So string theory is supposedto be a theory of everything because it unifies quantummechanics and gravity, and you know, people have their differentpet theories of everything, and the challenge witha theory of everything, I really love this quotequote from David Krakauer, which is, "A theory of everything is a theory of everything except those things that theorize."   Oh, you mean removing theobserver from the thing?   Yeah, but it's also weird because if a theory ofeverything explained everything, it should also explain the theory. So the theory has to be recursive, and none of our theoriesof physics are recursive. So it's a weird concept.   Yeah, but it's very difficult to integrate the observer into a theory.   I don't think so. I think you can builda theory acknowledging that you're an observerinside the universe,   But doesn't it becomerecursive in that way? And you're saying it'spossible to make a theory that's okay with that?   I think so. I mean, I don't think... There's always gonna be the paradox of another meta level you could build on the meta level, right? So like if you assumethis is your universe and you're the observer outside of it, you have some metadescription of that universe, but then you need a meta description of you describing that universe, right? So, you know, this is oneof the biggest challenges that we face being observersinside our universe. And also, you know, why the paradoxes and the foundations of mathematics and any place that we try tohave observers in the system or a system describing itself show up. But I think it is possibleto build a physics that builds in those things intrinsically, without having them be paradoxical or have holes in the descriptions. And so one place I thinkabout this quite a lot, which I think can give you sortof a more concrete example, is the nature of likewhat we call fundamental. So we typically definefundamental right now in terms of the smallestindivisible units of matter. So again, you have to have a definition of what you think materialis, and matter is, but right now the, you know, what's fundamental areelementary particles, and we think they're fundamental, because we can't break them apart further, and obviously we havetheories like string theory that if they're right, wouldreplace the current description of what's the most fundamentalthing in our universe by replacing it with something smaller, but we can't get to those theories, because we're technologically limited. And so if you look at thisfrom a historical perspective and you think about explanations changing as physical systems like us learn more about thereality in which they live, we once considered atoms tobe the most fundamental thing. And you know, it literallycomes from the word indivisible. And then we realizedatoms had substructure because we built better technology, which allowed us to quoteunquote, "see the world better," and resolve smaller features of it. And then we built even better technology, which allowed us to seeeven smaller structure and get down to thestandard model particles. And we think that there mightbe structure below that, but we can't get thereyet with our technology. So what's fundamental, the way we talk aboutit in current physics is not actually fundamental. It's the boundaries of what wecan observe in our universe, what we can see with our technology. And so if you wanna builda theory that's about us and about what's inside the universe that we can observe, notwhat's at the boundary of it, you need to talk about objectsthat are in the universe, that you can actually breakapart to smaller things. So I think the things that are fundamental are actually the constructed objects. They're the ones that really exist and you really understandtheir properties, because you know how theuniverse constructed them, because you can actually take them apart. You can understand theintrinsic laws that built them, but the things at the boundaryare just at the boundary, they're evolving with us, and we'll learn more aboutthat structure as we go along. But really, if we wanna talkabout what's fundamental inside our universe, we have to talk about all these things that are traditionallyconsidered emergent, but are really just structures in time that have causal historiesthat constructed them, and you know, are really actually what our universe is about.   So we should focus on the construction methodologyas the fundamental thing. But do you think there's a bottom to the smallest possible thingthat makes up the universe?   I don't see one.   And it'll take way too long. It'll take longer to find that, than it will to understand themechanism that created life.   I think so, yeah. I think for me, thefrontier in modern physics, where the new physics lies, is not in high energy particle physics, it's not in quantum gravity, it's not in any of thesesort of traditionally sold, "This is gonna be thenewest, deepest insight we have into the nature of reality." It is going to be in studyingthe problems of life, and intelligence, and thethings that are sort of also our current existentialcrises as a civilization or a culture that'sgoing through, you know, an existential trauma ofinventing technologies that we don't understand right now.   The existential trauma, and the terror we feelthat that technology might somehow destroy us, us meaning living,intelligent living organisms    Right.  And yet we don't understand what that even means.   Well, humans have always been afraid of our technologies though, right? So it's kind of a fascinating thing that every time we inventsomething we don't understand, it takes us a littlewhile to catch up with it.   I think also in part, humanskind of love being afraid.   Yeah, we love being traumatized.   It's weird, the drama.  We wanna learn more, and then when we learn moreit traumatizes us. (laughs) (Lex laughs) You know, I never thoughtabout this before, but I think this is one ofthe reasons I love what I do is because it traumatizesme all the time. (laughs) That sounds really bad, but what I mean is like, I lovethe shock of like realizing that like coming to understand something in a way that you neverunderstood it before. I think it seems to me, when I see a lot of the ways other people react to new ideas, that they don't feelthat way intrinsically. But for me that's like... That's why I do what I do. I love that feeling.   But you're also working on a topic where it's fundamentally ego destroying, because you're talking about like life. It's humbling to think that we're not... The individual human is not special.   Yeah.  And you're like very viscerally exploring that.   Yeah, I'm trying to embody that. I think you have to live thephysics to understand it. But there's a great quote about Einstein, I don't know if this is true or not, that he once said thathe could feel light beam in his belly. And I think...(both chuckle) But I think like, you gottathink about it though, right? Like if you're a really deep thinker, and you're really thinkingabout reality that deeply, and you are part of the reality that you're trying to describe, like you feel it, you really feel it.   That's what I was saying about, you're always likewalking along the cliff, and if you fall off, you'refalling into madness.   Yes, it's a constant,constant descent into madness.   The fascinating thing about physicists and madness is that you don't know if you've fallen off the cliff.   Yeah, I know. You don't know.   That's the cool thing about that.  I rely on other people to tell me. Actually this is very funny, 'cause like I have these conversations with my students often, like they're worried aboutgoing crazy, (laughs) and I have to like reassure them that like one of thereasons they'll stay sane is by trying to work on concrete problems.   Going crazy or waking up? I don't know which one it is.  Yeah.   So what do you think isthe origin of life on Earth, and how can we talk aboutit in a productive way?   The origin of life is like this boundary that the universe can only cross if a structure that emerges canreinforce its own existence, which is self reproduction,auto catalysis, things people traditionally talk about. But it has to be able to maintain its own existence against this sort of randomnessthat happens in chemistry, and this randomness thathappens in the quantum world. And like it's in some sense, the emergence of like adeterministic structure that says, you know, "I'm gonna exist andI'm gonna keep going." But you know, pinningthat down is really hard. We have ways of thinkingabout it in assembly theory that I think are pretty rigorous, and one of the thingsI'm really excited about is trying to actually quantify in an assembly theoretic way when the origin of life happens. But the basic process I have in mind is like a system that has no causal contingency,no constraints of objects, basically constraining theexistence of other objects or allowing the existenceof other objects. And so that sounds very abstract, but like you can just thinkof like a chemical reaction can't happen if there's nota catalyst, for example. Or a baby can't be bornif there wasn't a parent. So there's a lot of causal contingency that's necessary forcertain things to happen. So you think about this sortof unconstrained random system, there's nothing that reinforces the existence of other things. So the sort of resourcesjust get washed out in all of these different structures, and none of them exist again. Or they just, you know... They're not very complicatedif they're in high abundance, and some random events allow some things to start reinforcing the existence of a small subset of objects. And if they can do that, you know, like just molecules basicallyrecognizing each other and being able to catalyzecertain reactions. There's this kind oftransition point that happens, where unless you get aself reinforcing structure, something that canmaintain its own existence, it actually can't cross this boundary to make any objects in high abundance without having this sort of past history that it's carrying with us, and maintaining the existenceof that past history, and that boundary pointwhere objects can't exist unless they have theselection and history in them, is what we call the origin of life. And pretty much everythingbeyond that boundary, is holding on for dear lifeto all of the causation and causal structure that'sbasically put it there, and it's carving its waythrough this possibility space into generating more and more structure, and that's when you get theopen ended cascade of evolution. But that boundary pointis really hard to cross, and then what happens whenyou cross that boundary point and the way objects come into existence is also like really fascinating dynamics, because you know, like asthings become more complex, the assembly index increases. I can explain all these things, sorry. You can tell me what you want explained. (Sara laughs) Or what people will wanna hear. Sorry, I have like a veryvivid visual in my brain and it's really hard to articulate it.   Gotta convert it to language.   I know, it's so hard.(Sara laughs) It's like, it's going from like a feeling, to a visual, to language,is so stifling sometimes.   And then I have to convert it    Yeah.  From language to a visual.   Yeah.  To a feeling.   Yeah.  I think it's working.   I hope so.  I really like the self reinforcing objects. I mean, just so   Yeah.   Just so I understand, one way to create a lotof the same kind of object is make them self reinforcing.   Yes, so self reproductionhas its property, right? Like if that system can make itself, then it can persist in time, right? Because all objects decay, theyall have a finite lifetime. So if you're able to make acopy of yourself before you die, before the second law eats you or whatever people think happens, then that structure can persist in time.   So that's a way to sort ofemerge out of a random soup. Outta the randomness of soup.  Yes. Right, but things that cancopy themselves are very rare.   Yeah.  And so what ends up happening is that you get structures that enable the existence of other things, and then somehow, onlyfor some sets of objects, you get closed structuresthat are self reinforcing, and allow that entirestructure to persist.   Right, so the one... Object A reinforces theexistence of object B, but you know, object A can die.   Yeah.  So you have to like close that loop.   [Sara] Right, so this is the classic    And it's just all veryunlikely statistically, but you know, that's   Right.   Sufficiently... So you're saying there's a chance.   There is a chance.  It's low probability but once you solve that,once you close the loop, you can create a lot of those objects.   And that's what we'retrying to figure out, is what are the causalconstraints that close the loop. So there is this idea that'sbeen in the literature for a really long time, that was originallyproposed by Stuart Kauffman as really critical to the origin life called autocatalytic sets. So autocatalytic set isexactly this property. We have A makes B, B makes C, C makes A, and you get a closed system. But the problem with thetheory of autocatalytic sets is incredibly brittle as a theory and it requires a lotof ad hoc assumptions. Like you have to assume function, you have to say, "This thing makes B," it's not an emergent property, the association between A and B. And so the way I think aboutit is much more general, if you think about thesehistories that make objects, it's kind of like the structureof the histories becomes... Collapses in such a way that these things are all in the same sort of causal structure, and that causal structureactually loops back on itself to be able to generate some of the things that make the higher level structures. Lee has a beautiful example ofthis actually in molybdenum. It's like the firstnon organic autocatalytic set. It's a self reproducing molybdenum ring, but it's like molybdenum and basically like if youlook at the molybdenum, it makes a huge molybdenum ring. I don't remember exactly how big it is, it might be like 150molybdenum atoms or something. But if you think aboutthe configuration space of that object, you know,it's exponentially large, how many possible molecules? So like why does theentire system collapse on just making that one structure? If you start from like,you know, molybdenum atoms that are maybe just like acouple of them stuck together. And so what they see in this system is there's a few intermediate stages. So there's like some random events where the chemistry comestogether, makes these structures, and then once you getto this very large one, it becomes a templatefor the smaller ones, and then the whole system just reinforces its own production.   How did Lee find this molybdenum (both chuckle) closed loop.   If I knew how Lee's brain worked, I think I would understandmore about the universe, but I    [Lex] This is not an algorithmicdiscovery, it's a like    No, but I think it goes tothe deepest roots of like, when he started thinkingabout origins of life. So I like, I mean I don'tknow all his history, but like what he's told me is, he started out in crystallography, and you know, there's somethings that he would just... You know, like peoplewould just take for granted about chemical structures that he was like deeply perplexed about. Like just like why arethese like really intricate, really complex structures forming so easily under these conditions? And he was really interested in life, but he started in that field. So he's just carried with him these sort of deepinsights from these systems that seem like they're totally not alive, and just like these metallic chemistries, into actually thinking aboutthe deep principles of life. So I think he already knew a lot about that chemistry. And he also, you know... Assembly theory came from him thinking about how these systems work. So he had some intuitionabout what was going on with this molybdenum ring.   The molybdenum mightbe able to be the thing that makes a ring.   They knew about them for a long time, but they didn't know that the mechanism of why that particular structural form was autocatalytic feedback. And so that's what theyfigured out in this paper. And I actually think that paper is revealing some of the mechanism of the origin of life transition, 'cause really what you see, like the origin of life is basically like, you should have a combinatorial explosion of this space of possible structures that are too large to exhaust. And yet you see itcollapse on this, you know, really small space of possibilities, that's mutually reinforcingitself to keep existing. That is the origin of life.   There's some set of structures that result in thisautocatalytic feedback.   Yeah.  What is that? Some tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny percent?   I think it's a small space, but chemistry is very large, so    And so like   There might be a lot of them out there,but we don't know.   And one of them is the thing that probably started life on Earth.   That's right.  Or many, many starts.   Yes.  And it keeps starting maybe.   Yeah. I mean there's also all kindsof other weird properties that happen around thiskind of phase boundary. So this other project that I have in my lab is focusedon the origin of chirality, which is, you know, thinking about... So chirality is this property of molecules that they can come in mirror image forms. So like just like... Chiral literally means hand, so your left and right hand are what's called non super imposable, because if you try tolay one on the other, you can't actually lay themdirectly on top of each other, and that's the propertybeing a mirror image. So there's this sortof perplexing property of the chemistry life that no one's been able toreally adequately explain that all of the amino acidsin proteins are left handed, and all of the bases in RNAand DNA are right handed. And yet the chemistry ofthese building block units, the amino acids and nucleobases is the same for left and right handed. So you have to have like somekind of symmetry breaking, where you go from these chemistries that seem entirely equivalent to only having one chemistrytake over as the dominant form. And for a long time, I had been really... I actually did my PhD onthe origin of chirality. I was working on it as like a symmetry breakingproblem in physics. This is how I got startedin the origin of life, and then I left it for a long time, 'cause I thought it was like one of the most boringproblems in the origin of life, but I've come back it, 'cause I think there's somethingreally deep going on here related to this likecombinatorial explosion of the space of possibilities. But just to get to that point, like this feature of this handedness has been the main focus, but people take for granted the existence of chiral molecules at all, that this property of having a handedness. And they just assume that, you know, like it's just a genericfeature of chemistry. But if you actually look at molecules, if you look at chemical space, which is like the spaceof all possible molecules that people can generate, and you look at small molecules, things that have less thanabout seven to 11 heavy atoms, so things that are not hydrogen. Almost every single moleculein that space is achiral, like doesn't have a chiral center. So it would be like a spoon. A spoon doesn't have a... Like it's the same as its mirror image. It's not like a hand that'sdifferent than its mirror image. But if you get to likethis threshold boundary, above that boundary, almostevery single molecule is chiral. So you go from a universe where almost nothinghas a mirror image form. There's no mirror imageuniverse of possibilities, to this one where every single structure has pretty much a mirror image version. And what we've been looking at in my lab is that it seems to be the case that the origin of life transition happens around the time when youstart accumulating... You push your molecules toa large enough complexity that chiral moleculesbecome very likely to form, and then there's a cascadeof molecular recognition where chiral moleculescan recognize each other, and then you get this sortof autocatalytic feedback and things self reinforcing.   So is chirality in itselfan interesting feature or just an accident?   No, it's a super interesting feature. I think chirality breakssymmetry in time not space. So we think of it as a spatial property, like a left and right hand, but if I choose the left hand, I'm basically choosingthe future of that system, for all time, because I'vebasically made a choice between the ways that thatmolecule can now react with every other objectin its chemical universe.   Oh, I see.  And so you're actually... Like when you have thissplitting of making a molecule that now hasanother form it could have had, by the same exact atomic composition, but now it's just a mirror image isometry, you're basically splittingthe universe of possibilities every time.   Yeah, in two.  In two, but molecules can have morethan one chiral center, and that's not the onlysymmetry that they can have. So this is one of the reasons that Taxol fills 1.5 universes of space. It's all of these spatial permutations that you do on these objects that actually makes the space so huge. So the point of thissort of chiral transition that I'm putting out is, chirality is actually a signature of being in a complex chemical space. And the fact that we thinkit's a really generic feature of chemistry and it's really prevalent, is because most of thechemistry we study on Earth is a product already of life. And it also has to do withthis transition in assembly, this transition in possibility spaces, because I think there'ssomething really fundamental going on at this boundary, that you don't really need to go that far into chemical space if you can... To actually see life interms of this depth in time, this depth in symmetries of objects, in terms of like chiral symmetries, or this assembly structure. But getting past this boundary that's not very deep inthat space requires life. It's a really weird property, and it's really weird thatso many abrupt things happen in chemistry at that same scale.   So would that be thegreatest invention ever made on Earth in its evolutionary history? So I really like that formulation of it. Nick Lane has a bookcalled, "Life Ascending," where he lists the 10 greatinventions of evolution, the origin of life being first, and DNA, the hereditary material that encodes the genetic instructions for all living organisms. Then photosynthesis, theprocess that allows organisms to convert sunlight into chemical energy, producing oxygen as a byproduct. The complex cell, eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus and organelles, arose from simple bacterial cells. Sex, sexual reproduction. Movement, so just the ability to move, under which you have the predation, the predators and abilityof living organisms    Oh, I like that movement's  To find food.   In there, that's cool.   Yeah, but movement includes a lot of interesting stuff in there, like predator prey dynamic.   Right.  Which, not to romanticize, nature is metal. That seems like an important one. I don't know. It's such a computationally powerful thing to have a predator and prey.   Well, it's efficient for things to eat other thingsthat are already alive, 'cause they don't haveto go all the way back to the base chemistry.   Well that, but maybeI just like deadlines, but it creates an urgency. You're gonna get eaten.   You gotta live.   Yeah, like the survival. It's not just the static environment you battle against, you're like    Yeah.  The dangers against which you're tryingto survive are also evolving. This is just a much faster way to explore the space of possibilities.   I actually think it's a giftthat we don't have much time.   Yes. Sight, the ability to see. So the increasing complexifyingof sensory organisms. Consciousness and death. The concept of programmed cell death. These are all inventions.   Yeah.  Along the line.   I like invention as a wordfor them. I think that's good.   Which are the moreinteresting inventions to you? Origin of life? Because you kind of are not glorifying the origin of life itself. There's a process   No, I think the origin of life is a continual process, that's why. I'm interested in the first transition in solving that problem, 'cause I think it's the hardest, but I think it's happening all the time.   When you look back atthe history of Earth, like what are you impressed happened?   I like sight as an invention, 'cause I think having sensory perception and trying to "comprehend the world," to use anthropocentric terms, is like a really critical feature of life. And I also... It's interesting the way that sight has complexified over time, right? So like if you thinkat the origin of life, nothing on the planet could see, right? So like for a longtime, life had no sight. And then, you know, likephoton receptors were invented. And then when multicellularity evolved, those cells eventually grew into eyes and we had the multicellular eye. And then it's interesting,when you get to societies, like human societies, that we invent even bettertechnologies of seeing, like telescopes and microscopes, which allow us to seedeeper into the universe or at smaller scales. So I think that's pretty profound, the way that sight hastransformed the ability of life to literally see the realityin which it's existing in. I think consciousness is also obviously deeply interesting. I've gotten kind ofobsessed with like octopus. I don't like, I... They're just so weird, and the fact that like theyevolved complex nervous systems kind of independently islike, seems very alien.   Yeah, there's a lotof alien like organisms. That's another thing I saw in the jungle.   Yeah.  Just things that are like, "Oh, okay. They make one of those, huh?" It just feels like there's   Do you have any examples?   There's a frog that's asthin as a sheet of paper.   Oh wow.  And I was like, "What?" And it gives birththrough like pores, like    Oh, I've seen videos of that. It's so gross when the babies come out.   Yes.  Did you see that? Like in person   Yes.   Like the babies coming out?  Oh no, no. I saw the... Without the   Have you seen videos of that? It's so gross. It's one of the grossestthings I've ever seen. (laughs)   Well, gross is just the otherside of beautiful I think.   Yeah.  'Cause it's like, "Oh wow, that's possible."   I guess if I was one of those frogs, I would think that wasthe most beautiful event I'd ever seen. Although like human childbirthis not that beautiful either. (Sara laughs)  Yeah, it's all a matter of perspective.   Well we come intothe world so violently, it's just like... It's amazing.   Well, I mean the worldis a violent place.   Yeah.  So again, another... It's just another side of the coin.   You know what, this actually makes me thinkof one that's not up there, which I do find really incredibly amazing, is the process of likethe germline cell in... You know, in organisms. Like basically like everyliving thing on this planet at some point in its life hasto go through a single cell, and this whole issue of like development, like the developmentalprogram is kind of crazy. Like how do you buildyou out of a single cell? How does a single cellknow how to do that? Like, you know, pattern formation of a multicellular organism, obviously like evolves with DNA. But there's a lot of stuff happening there about when cells takeon certain morphologies and things that people don't understand, like the actual shape formation mechanism. And a lot of people study that and it's... And there's a lot of advancesbeing made now in that field. I think it's pretty shocking though that like how little weknow about that process. And often it's left off of people's lists. It's just kind of interesting. Embryogenesis is fascinating.   Yeah, 'cause it... You start from just one cell.   Yeah, and the genes in allthe cells are the same, right? So like the differentiation has to be something that's like much more about like theactual like, you know, expression of genes over time, and like how they get switched on and off, and also the physical environment of like the cell interactingwith other cells, and there's just a lot of stuff going on.   Yeah, the computation, theintelligence of that process    Yes.  Might be like the most important thing to understand, and we just kind of don'treally think about it.   Right.  We think about the final product.   Yeah.  Maybe the key to understanding the organismis understanding that process, not the final product   Probably, yes. I think most of the things about understanding anything about what we are, are embedded in time.   [Lex] Well of course you would say that.   I know, so predictable. (laughs) It's turning into adeterministic universe.   It always has been. Always was, like the meme.   Yeah, always was, butit won't be in the future.   Well that's... Before we talk about the future, let's talk about thepast, the assembly theory.   Yes.  Can you explain assembly theory to me? I listened to Lee talkabout it for many hours and I understood nothing. No, I'm just kidding.(Sara laughs) I just wanted to take another... Well, you've beenalready talking about it, but just another   Yeah.   What from a big picture view is the assembly theory wayof thinking about our world, about our universe.   Yeah. I think the first thing is, you know, that like the observation that, life seems to be the onlything in the universe that builds complexity inthe way that we see it here, and complexity is obviouslylike a loaded term. So I'll just use assembly instead, 'cause I think assembly is more precise. But the idea that like, you know, all the things on your desk here, from your computer, to the pen, to, you know, us sitting here, don't exist anywhere else inthe universe as far as we know. They only exist on this planet. And it took a long evolutionaryhistory to get to us, is a real feature thatwe should take seriously as one that's deeply embeddedin the laws of physics and the structure of theuniverse that we live in. Standard physics would say that, you know, all of that complexity traces back to the infinitesimal deviations in like the initial state of the universe, that there was some order there. I find that deeply unsatisfactory, and what assembly theory says, that's very different, is that the universe isbasically constructing itself. And when you get to thesecombinatorial spaces like chemistry, where the space ofpossibilities is too large to exhaust them all, you can only construct things along historically contingent paths. Like you basically have causalchains of events that happen to allow other thingsto come into existence. And that this is the way that complex objects get formed, is basically on scaffolding onthe past history of objects, making more complex objects, making more complex objects. That idea in itself iseasy to state and simple, but it has some reallyradical implications as far as what you think isthe nature of the physics that would describe life. And so what assembly theory does formally, is try to measure the boundary in the space of all things that, you know, chemicallycould exist, for example, like all possible molecules. Where is the boundaryabove which we should say, "These things are too complex to happen outside of anevolutionary chain of events, outside of selection." And we formalize thatwith two observables, one of them is the copynumber of the object. So how many of the object did you observe? And the second one is,what's the minimal number of recursive steps to make it? So if you start fromelementary building blocks like bonds for molecules and you put them together, and then you take thingsyou've made already and built up to the object, what's the shortest numberof steps you had to take? And what Lee's been able toshow in the lab with his team is that for organic chemistry,it's about 15 steps. And then you only seemolecules that, you know... Only molecules that we observe, that are past that threshold,are ones that are in life. And in fact, one of thethings I'm trying to do with this idea of like trying to actuallyquantify the origin of life as a transition in... Like a phase transition assembly theory, is actually be able to explain why that boundary is where it is, 'cause I think that'sactually the boundary that life must cross. So the idea of going back to this thing we were talking about before about these structures that can reinforce their own existence and move past that boundary. 15 seems to be thatboundary in chemical space. It's not a universal number. It will be different fordifferent assembly spaces, but that's what we'veexperimentally validated so far, and then    So literally 15, likethe assembly index is 15?   It's 15 or so for theexperimental data, yeah.   So that's when you startgetting the self reinforcing?   That's when you haveto have that feature in order to observemolecules in high abundance in that space.   So copy number is thenumber of exact copies. That's what you mean by high abundance, and assembly index or thecomplexity of the object is how many steps it took to create it. Recursive   Recursive, yeah. So you can think of objects in assembly theory asbasically recursive stacks of the construction steps to build them. So they're like, it's like... You take this step and then you make this object,and you make it this object, and make this object, and then you get up to the final object, but that object is all of that history rolled up into the current structure.   What if you took the long way home    You can't take the long way.   Why not?  The long way doesn't exist.   It's a good song though. What do you mean thelong way doesn't exist? If I do a random walk from A to B, I'll eventually... If I start at A, I'lleventually end up at B, and that random walk would bemuch longer than the short.   No, if you look at objects and you... So we define something wecall the assembly universe, and assembly universe is ordered in time. It's actually ordered in the causation, the number of steps to produce an object, and so all objects in theuniverse, are in some sense... Exist at a layer that's definedby their assembly index, and the size of each layeris growing exponentially. So what you're talking about, if you wanna look at the longway of getting to an object, as I'm increasing theassembly index of an object, I'm moving deeper and deeper into an exponentially growing space. And it's actually also the case that the sort of typicalpath to get to that object is also exponentially growing with respect to the assembly index. And so if you want to try to make a more and more complex object, and you wanna do it by a typical path, that's actually anexponentially receding horizon. And so most objectsthat come into existence have to be causally very similarto the things that exist, 'cause they're close by in that space, and they can actually get to it by an almost shortestpath for that object.   Yeah, the almost shortestpath is the most likely like by a lot.   By a lot.  Okay. So if you see a high copy number.   Yeah, imagine yourself   A copy number of greater than one.   Yeah, I mean basically we live... The more complex we get, we live in a space that isgrowing exponentially large, and the ways of getting to objects in the space are alsogrowing exponentially large. And so we're this kind of recursively like stacked structure of like all of these objects that are clinging ontoeach other for existence, and then they like grab something else, and are like able to bringthat thing into existence, 'cause it's kind of similar to them.   But there is a phase transition. There is a    There is a transition.  There is a place where you would say, "Oh "   I think it's actually abrupt. I've never been able to saythat in my entire career before. I've always gone back and forth about whether the originof life was kind of gradual or abrupt, I think it's very abrupt.   Poetically, chemically   Life snaps into existence.   Oh it snaps, okay, that's very beautiful.  It snaps.   Okay, but   We'll be poetic today. But no, I think there's likea lot of random exploration and then there's a like... And then the possibility space just collapses on thestructure kind of really fast. That can reinforce its own existence, because it's basicallyfighting against non existence.   Yeah, you tweeted, "Themost significant struggle for existence in the evolutionary process is not among the objects that do exist, but between the ones that do, and those that never have the chance to.   Yeah.  This is where selection does most of its causal work." The objects that neverget a chance to exist.   Yeah.  The struggle between the ones that never get a chance toexist and the ones that... Okay, what's that line exactly?   I don't know, we can makesongs out of all of these.   What are the objects that never get a chance to exist? What does that mean?   So there was this website, I forgot what it was, but it's like a neural network that just generates a human face, and it's like, "Thisperson does not exist." I think that's what it's called, right? So you can just click on that all day, and you can look at peopleall day that don't exist.   Yeah.  All of those people exist in that space ofthings that don't exist.   Yeah, but there's the real struggle.   Yeah, so the struggle of the quote, the struggle for existence is, you know, that goes all the way back to Darwin's writing aboutnatural selection, right? So like the whole idea ofsurvival of the fittest is everything struggling to exist, this predator prey dynamic, and the fittest survive, and so the struggle for existence is really what selection is all about. And that's true, we dosee things that do exist competing to continue to exist. But each time that... Like if you think aboutthis space of possibilities and you know, each time the universe, you know, generates a new structure, or like an object that exists, generates a new structurealong this causal chain. It's generating something that exists, that never existed before. And each time that we makethat kind of decision, we're excluding a hugespace of possibilities. And so actually like as this process of increasing assembly index, it's not just that like the space that these objects exist inis exponentially growing, but there are objects in that space that are exponentiallyreceding away from us. So they're becoming exponentially less and less likely to ever exist, and so existence excludesa huge number of things.   Just because of the accidentof history, how it ended up.   Yeah, it is in part an accident, because I think some of the structure that gets generated isdriven a bit by randomness. I think a lot of it, you know, so... You know, one of theconceptions that we have in assembly theory is, you know, the universeis random at its base. You can see this in chemistry, like unconstrained chemicalreactions are pretty random. And also quantum mechanics, you know, like there's lots of placesthat give evidence for that. And deterministic structures emerge by things that can causallyreinforce themselves and maintain persistence over time. And so we are some of themost deterministic things in the universe. And so like we can generatevery regular structure, and we can generate new structure along a particular lineage. But the possibility spaceat the sort of tips, like the things we cangenerate next is really huge. So there's some stochasticityin what we actually, you know, instantiate as like the next structures that get built in the biosphere. It's not completely deterministic, 'cause the space of future possibilities is always larger than thespace of things that exist now.   So how many instantiationsof life is out there, do you think? So how often does this happen? What we see happen here on Earth? How often is this process repeated throughout our galaxy,throughout the universe?   So I said before, like right now, I think the origin of life isa continuous process on Earth. Like, I think this idea oflike combinatorial spaces that our biosphere generates,not just chemistry, but other spaces, oftencross this threshold where they then allow themselves to persist with particularregular structure over time. So language is anotherone where, you know, like the space of, you know,possible configurations of the 26 letters of the English alphabet is astronomically large, but we use with very highregularity, certain structures. And then we associate meaning to them because of the regularity of like how much we use them, right? So meaning is an emergentproperty of the causation and the objects and likehow often they recur, and what the relationshipof the recurrence is to other objects.   Meaning is the emergent property. Okay, got it.  Well this is why you can play withlanguage so much actually. So words don't really carry meaning, it's just about howyou lace them together.   Yeah, but from where does the    But you don't have a lot of room... Obviously, as a speakerof a given language, you don't have a lot of roomwith a given word to wiggle. But you have a certain amount of room to push the meanings of words.   Yeah.  And I do this all the time and you have to do it withthe kind of work that I do. Because if you want todiscover an abstraction, like some kind of concept that we don't understand yet, it means we don't have the language. And so the words that we have are inadequate to describe the things. This is why we're having a hard time talking about assembly theory, 'cause it's a newly emerging idea. And so I'm constantly playing with words in different ways to tryto convey the meaning that is actually behind the words, but it's hard to do.   So you have to wigglewithin the constraints.   Yes, lots of wiggle.   The great orators arejust good at wiggling.   Do you wiggle? (laughs)   I'm not a very good wiggler, no. This is the problem. Thisis part of the problem.   No, I like playing with words a lot. You know, it's very funny 'cause you know, like I know you talkedabout this with Lee, but like, people were so offended by the writing of the paperthat came out last fall, and it was interesting because the ways that we use words were not the way thatpeople were interacting with the words. And I think that was part of the mismatch, where we were trying touse words in a new way, 'cause we were trying to describesomething that, you know, hadn't been described adequately before. But we had to use the wordsthat everyone else uses for things that are related, and so it was really interesting to watch that clash play out in real time, for me, being someone that tries to be so precise with my word usage, knowingthat it's always gonna be vague.   Boy, can I relate. It's like, what is truth? Is truth the thing you meantwhen you wrote the words? Or is truth the thingthat people understood when they read the words?   Oh yeah.  I think that compression mechanism into language is a really interesting one, and that's why Twitter is a nice exercise    I love Twitter.  You get to write a thing, and you think a certainthing when you write it, and then you get to see allthese other people interpret it all kinds of different ways.   I use it as an experimentalplatform for that reason.   I wish there was a higher diversity of interpretation mechanismsapplied to tweets. Meaning like   Oh.   All kinds of differentpeople would come to it. Like some people that seethe good in everything and some people that are ultra cynicals.   Yeah.  A bunch of haters and a bunch of lovers and a bunch of    Maybe they could do better jobs with presenting material to people. Like, you know, they ran like... How things, you know, it'slike usually based on interest, but I think it would bereally nice if you got like, 10% of your Twitter feed was random stuff sampled from other places,that'd be kind of fun.   True. I also would love tofilter, just like bin, the response to tweets by like the people thathate on everything.   Yes.  The people that are    Oh, that would be fantastic.   The people that are likesuper positive about everything, and then that'll just kind of, I guess, normalize the response.   Yeah.  Because then it'd be cool to see if the people that are usuallypositive about everything are hating on you, or like totally don't understand, or completely misunderstood.   Yeah, usually takes a lotof clicking to find that out. Yeah, so it'd be betterif it was sorted, yeah.   The more clicking you do, the more damaging it is to the soul.  Yeah. It's like instead of like... Like you could have the blue check, but you should have like, areyou a pessimist, an optimist?   There's a lot of   Chaotic neutral? (laughs)   A whole rainbow of checks. And then you realizethere's more categories than we can possibly express in colors.   Yeah, of course. People are complex.   That's our best feature. I don't know how we gotto the wiggling required, given the constraints of language, because I think we started aboutme asking about alien life, which is, how many different times did the phase transition happen elsewhere? Do you think there's otheralien civilizations out there?   This goes into like the, you know, like are you on theboundary of insane or not? But you know, when youthink about the structure of the physics of what we are that deeply, it really changes yourconception of things. And you know, going tothis idea of the universe, you know, being kind ofsmall in physical space compared to how big it is intime and like how large we are. It really makes me question about whether there's any other structure that's like this giant crystal in time, this giant causal structure, like our biosphere/technosphere is, anywhere else in the universe.   Why not?  I don't know.   Just because this one is gigantic doesn't mean there'sno other gigantic ones    Right, but I think when theuniverse is expanding, right? It's expanding in space, but in assembly theory it'salso expanding in time. And actually that's drivingthe expansion in space, and expansion in time isalso driving the expansion in the sort of combinatorialspace of things on our planet. So that's driving the sort of, you know, pace of technology andall the other things. So time is driving all of these things, which is a little bit crazy to think that the universe is just getting bigger because time is getting bigger. But like this sort of visual that gets built in my brain about that is like this structure that we're building on this planet is packing more and more time in this very small volume of space, right? 'Cause our planet hasn'tchanged its physical size in 4 billion years, but there's like a ton ofcausation and recursion and time, whatever word you wanna use, information, packed into this. And I think this is also, you know, embedded in sort of thevirtualization of our technologies or the abstraction of language and all of these things, these things that seem really abstract are just really deep in time. And so what that looks like is, you have a planet that becomesincreasingly virtualized, and so it's gettingbigger and bigger in time, but not really expanding out in space, and the rest of space is likekind of moving away from it. Again, it's a sort ofexponentially receding horizon. And I'm just not sure how far into this evolutionaryprocess something gets, if it can ever see that there's anothersuch structure out there.   What do you mean byvirtualized in that context?   Virtual as sort of aplay on virtual reality and like simulation theories, but virtual also in a sense of, you know, we talk about virtualparticles in particle physics, which, you know, they are very critical to doing calculations aboutpredicting the properties of real particles, but wedon't observe them directly. So what I mean by virtual here is, virtual reality for me, things that appearvirtual, appear abstract, are just things thatare very deep in time, in the structure ofthe things that we are. So if you think about you asa 4 billion year old object, the things that are a part of you, like your capacity uselanguage or think abstractly or have mathematics,are just very, you know, like deep, temporal structures. That's why they look likethey're informational and abstract, is because they're like... They're existing in thistemporal part of you, but not necessarily spatial part.   Just because I have a 4billion year old history, why does that mean I can'thang out with aliens?   There's a couple ideasthat are embedded here. So one of them comes, again, from Paul, he wrote this book yearsago about, you know, like the eerie silenceand why we're alone. And he concluded the book withthis idea of quintelligence or something, but likethis idea that like, really advanced intelligence would basically just builditself into a quantum computer and it would wanna operatein the vacuum of space, 'cause that's the best placeto do quantum computation, and it would just like run out all of its computations indefinitely, but it would look completely dark to the rest of the universe. And I don't think.... As typical, like, I don'tthink that's actually like the right physics, but I think something about that idea, as I do with all ideas,is partially correct. And Freeman Dyson alsohad this amazing paper about how long life could persist in a universe that wasexponentially expanding. And his conception was like, if you imagine analog life form, it could run slower andslower and slower and slower and slower as a function of time. And so it would be ableto run indefinitely, even against an exponentiallyexpanding universe, because it would justrun exponentially slower. And so I guess part ofwhat I'm doing in my brain is putting those two things together along with this ideathat we are building... You know, like if youimagine, with our technology, we're now buildingvirtual realities, right? Like things we actuallycall virtual reality, which required, you know,four billions years of history and a whole bunch of data to basically embed them ina computer architecture. So now you can put like, youknow, an Oculus headset on and think that you'rein this world, right? And what you really are embedded in is in a very deep temporal structure. And so it's huge in time,but it's very small in space, and you can go lots of placesin the virtual space, right? But you're still stuck inlike your physical body and like sitting in the chair. And so, you know, part of it is, it might be the case thatsufficiently evolved biospheres kind of virtualize themselves, and they internalize their universe and their sort oftemporal causal structure, and they close themselves offfrom the rest of the universe.   I just don't know if adeep temporal structure necessarily means that you're closed off.   No, I don't either. So that's kind of my fear. So I'm not sure I'magreeing with what I say. I'm just saying like, thisis one sort of conclusion and you know, like inmy most sort of like... It's interesting, 'cause Idon't do psychedelic drugs, but when people describe to me, like your thing with the faces and stuff, and like I have... You know, I've had a lot ofdeep conversations with friends that have done psychedelicdrugs for intellectual reasons and otherwise, but I'm always like, "Oh, it sounds like you'rejust doing theoretical physics. Like that's what brains do ontheoretical physics." (laughs) So I live in these likereally abstract spaces most of the time, but there's also thisissue of extinction, right? Like extinction eventsare basically pinching off an entire, like, causal structure. One of these like... I'm gonna call them time crystals, I don't like know what... But there's like thesevery large objects in time, pinching off that wholestructure from the rest of it. And so it's like, if youimagine that sort of same thing in the universe, you know, I once thought that sufficientlyadvanced technologies would look like black holes.   That would be justcompletely imperceptible to us.   Yeah. So there might be lotsof aliens out there. Maybe that's the explanationfor all the singularities, they're all pinched off causal structures that virtualized their reality and kind of broke off from us.   Black holes in every way,so like untouchable to us or unlikely to be detectable by us    Right.  With whatever sensory mechanisms we have.   Yeah, but the otherway I think about it is, there is probably,hopefully life out there. So like I do work onlife detection efforts in the solar system, and I'm trying to help with theHabitable Worlds Observatory mission planning right now, and working with like thebio signatures team for that. Like to think aboutexoplanet bio signatures. So like I have some optimismthat we might find things, but there are the challenges that we don't know thelikelihood for life, like, which is what you were talking about. So if I get to a more grounded discussion, what I'm really interested in doing is trying to solve the origin of life so we can understand howlikely life is out there. So I don't think that the... I think that the problemof discovering alien life and solving the origin oflife are deeply coupled, and in fact are one and the same problem. And that the first contact with alien life will actually be in anorigin of life experiment, but that part I'm super interested in. And then there's this other feature that I think about a lot, which is, our own technological phase ofdevelopment as sort of like, what is this phase in theevolution of life on a planet. If you think about abiosphere emerging on a planet and evolving over billions of years and evolving into a technosphere, when a technosphere can move off planet and basically reproduceitself on another planet, now you have biospheresreproducing themselves, basically. They have to go throughtechnology to do that. And so there are ways of thinking about sort of the nature of intelligent life and how it spreads in that capacity, that I'm also really excitedabout and thinking about. And all of those thingsfor me are connected. Like we have to solve the origin of life in order for us to get off planet, because we basically have tostart life on another planet, and we also have tosolve the origin of life in order to recognizeother alien intelligence. Like all of these things are like literally the same problem.   Right, understanding theorigin of life here on Earth is a way to understand ourselves and to... Understanding ourselves is a prerequisite for being able to detect otherintelligent civilizations. I, for one, take it for whatit's worth, on ayahuasca, one of the things I did iszoom out, like aggressively, at like a spaceship. And it would always goquickly through the galaxy, and from the galaxy to thisrepresentation of the universe. And at least for me,from that perspective, it seemed like it was full of alien life. Not just alien life, but intelligent life    I like that.  And conscious life. So like, I don't know howto convert it into words. It's more like a feeling,like you were saying.   Yeah.  A feeling, convert it to a visual,to convert it to words. So I had a visual with it, but really it was a feeling, that it was just fullof this vibrant energy, that I was feeling when I'm looking at the people in my life    Yeah.  And full of gratitude, but that same exact thing iseverywhere in the universe.   Right.  So    I totally agree with this, like that visual, I really love. And I think we live in a universe that like generates life and purpose, and like it's part of thestructure of just the world. And so maybe like this sortof lonely view I have is, I never thought about it this way until you were describing that. I was like, "I wannalive in that universe." And I'm like a very optimistic person and I love building visions of reality that are positive, but I think for me right now,in the intellectual process, I have to tunnel through thisparticular way of thinking about the lonelinessof being like separated in time from everything else, which I think like we also all are, because time is whatdefines us as individuals.   So part of you is drawn to the trauma of being alone deep   Yeah.   In a physics sense.  Yeah, but also part of what I mean is, like you have to go through ideas you don't necessarily agree with to work out what you'retrying to understand. And I'm trying to be inside this structure so I can really understand it. And I don't think I'vebeen able to like... Like I'm so deeply embedded in what we are intellectually, right now, that I don't have an abilityto see these other ones that you're describing, if they're there.   Well, one of the thingsyou kind of described that you already spoke to, you call it the great perceptual filter.   Yeah.  So there's the famous great filter, which is basically the idea that there's some really powerful moment in every intelligent civilization where they destroy themselves.   Yeah.  That explains why we have not seen aliens. And you're saying thatthere's something like that in the temporal history of thecreation of complex objects, that at a certain pointthey become an island, an island too far to reachbased on the perceptions.   I hope not, but yeah,I worry about it, yeah.   But that's basically meaning, there's something fundamentalabout the universe, where the more complex you become, the harder it will be toperceive other complex    Yeah, I mean just think about us with microbial life, right? Like we used to once be cells, and for most of human history, we didn't even recognizecellular life was there until we built a newtechnology, microscopes, that allowed us to see them, right? So it's kind of weird, right? Like things that we   And they're close to us.   They're close, they're everywhere.   But also in the historyof the development of complex objects, they're pretty close.   Yes, super close. Super close. Like yeah, I mean everything on this planet is like. (laughs) It's like pretty much the same thing. Like the space ofpossibilities is so huge, it's like we're virtually identical.   So how many flavors or kinds of life doyou think are possible?   I'm like trying to imagine all the little flickeringlights in the universe. Like in the way that you were describing, that was kind of cool.   I mean, it was awesome to me. It was exactly that. It was like lights.  Yeah.   The way you maybe see a city, but yeah, a city from like up above, you see a city with the flickering lights, but there's a coldness to the city.   Yeah.  There's some... You know that, you know, humansare capable of good and evil and you could see like there's a complex feeling to the city. I had no such complex feelingabout seeing the lights of all the galaxies, whatever,the billions of galaxies.   Yeah, this is kind of cool. I'll answer the question in a second, but I just maybe like... This idea of flickering lights and intelligence isinteresting to me, because I... You know, like we havesuch a human centric view of alien intelligences, that a lot of the work thatI've been doing with my lab is just trying to take inspiration from non human life on Earth. And so I have this reallytalented undergrad student that's basically building a model of alien communication based on fireflies. So one of my colleagues, Orit Peleg, she's totally brilliant, but she goes out with like GoPro cameras and like, you know,films in high resolution, all these firefly flickering. And she has like this theory about how their signaling evolved to like maximally differentiatethe flickering pattern. So like she has a theorybasically that predicts, you know, like this species should flash like this. If this one's flashing like this, this other one's gonnado it at a slower rate, so that they... You know, like they candistinguish each other living in the same environment. And so this undergrad'sbuilding this model where you have like a pulsar background of all these like giantflashing sources in the universe and an alien intelligence, you know, wants to signal it's there, so it's flashing like a firefly. (laughs) And I just like the idea of thinking about non humanaliens, so that was really fun.   The mechanism of theflashing, unfortunately is... Like the diversity of that is very high and we might not be ableto see it, that's what    Yeah, well I think there's some ways we might be able todifferentiate that signal. I'm still thinking about this part of it. So one is, like if you have pulsars and they all have a certain spectrum to their pulsing patterns, and you have this onesignal that's in there, that's basically tried tomaximally differentiate itself from all the othersources in the universe. It might stick out in the distribution. Like there might be ways of actually being able to tell if it's an anomalous pulsar, basically. But I don't know if thatwould really work or not. So, still thinking about it.   You tweeted, "If one wants to understand how truly combinatorially and compositionallycomplex our universe is, they only need step intothe world of fashion."   Yeah.  "It's bonkers how big the constructablespace of human aesthetics is." Can you explain? Can we explore the spaceof human aesthetics?   Yeah, I don't know. I've been kind of obsessed with the... I never know how to pronounce it. Is it Schiaparelli? Like, you know, like theyhave ears and things. Like it's such like aweird, grotesque aesthetic, but like it's totally bizarre. But what I meant... Like I have a visceral experience when I walk into my closet. I have like a lot of  (laughs)   [Lex] How big is your closet?   It's pretty big. It's like, I do assemblytheory every morning when I walk in my closet, because I really like a very large, combinatorial, diverse palette, but I never know what I'mgonna build in the morning.   Do you get rid of stuff?  Sometimes.   Or do you have troublegetting rid of stuff? Like    I have trouble gettingrid of some stuff. It depends on what it is. If it's vintage, it's hard to get rid of, 'cause it's kind of hard to replace. It depends on the piece, yeah.   So you have... Your closet is one of thosetemporal time crystals that    Yeah, it's like   You get to visualize the entire history of the   It's a physical manifestation of my personality.   Right. So why is that a good visualization of the combinatorial andcomposition and complex.   I think it's an interestingfeature of our species that we get to express ourself through what we wear, right? Like if you think about all those animals in the jungle you saw, like they're born the way they look, and then they're stuck with it for life.   That's true, I mean, it is one of the loudest, clearest, most consistent ways wesignal to each other    Yeah.  It's the clothing we wear.   Yeah, and it's highly dynamic. I mean you can be dynamic if you want to. Very few people are... There's a certain bravery, but it's actually more about confidence, willing to play with style and like... And play with aesthetics. And I think it's interesting when you start experimenting with it, how it changes the fluidityof the social spaces and the way that you interact with them.   But there's also commitment. Like you have to wearthat outfit all today.   I know, I know. A big commitment. Do you feel like thatevery morning? (laughs)   No. That's why   I feel like, this is a life commitment. (laughs)   So all I have is suits andthe black shirt and jeans. Those are the two outfits.   Yeah. Well see this is the thing though, right? It's simplifies your thoughtprocess in the morning. So like I have other ways I do that. I park in the same exact parking spot when I go to work on the fourthfloor of a parking garage, because no one ever parkson the fourth floor. So I don't have to rememberwhere I park my car. But I really like aestheticsand playing with them. So I'm willing to spend part of my cognitive energy every morning trying to figure outwhat I wanna be that day.   Did you deliberately think about the outfit you're wearing today?   Yep.  Was there backup options? Or were you going backand forth between some    Three or four, but I really like    Were they drastically different?   Yes.  Okay.(laughs) Okay.  And then even this one could have been really different, because like, you know, it's not just the sort ofjacket and the shoes and like, and the hairstyle. It's like the jewelry and the accessories. So like any outfit is alot of small decisions.   Well I think your current outfit is like a lot of shades of yellow. There's like a theme.  Yes. Yeah.  It's nice. I'm grateful that you did that.   Thanks.  It's like it's own art form.   Yeah, yellow's mydaughter's favorite color, and I never reallythought about yellow much, but she's been obsessed with yellow. She's seven now and I don'tknow, I just really love it.   I guess you can pick a color and just make that the constraint, and just go with it and understand the beauty   I'm playing with yellow a lot lately. Like this is not even the most yellow, 'cause I have black pants on, but I have... I've worn outfits that have probably fiveshades of yellow in them.   Wow.(Sara laughs) What do you think beauty is? We seem to... So underlying this idea ofplaying with aesthetics is, we find certain things beautiful.   Yeah.  What is it that humans find beautiful? And why do we need tofind things beautiful?   Yeah. You know, it's interesting. I mean I am attractedto style and aesthetics, because I think they're beautiful, but it's much more because Ithink it's fun to play with. And so I will get to the beauty thing, but I guess I wanna justexplain a little bit about my motivation this space, 'cause it's really anintellectual thing for me. And you know, Stewart Brandhas this great infographic about the layers of like human society. And I think it starts withlike the natural sciences and like physics at the bottom, and it goes through all these layers, and it's like economics andthen like fashion is at the top, it's like the fastest movingpart of human culture. And I think I really like that, because it's so dynamic and so short in it's temporal longevity, contrasted with likestudying the laws of physics, which are like, you know, likethe deep structure reality, that I feel like bridging those scales tells me much more aboutthe structure of the world that I live in.   That said, there'scertain kinds of fashions, like a dude in a blacksuit with a black tie seems to be less dynamic.   Yeah.  It seems to persist through time.   Are you embodying this?  Yeah, I think so. (both laugh) I think it just   I'd like to see you wear yellow, Lex. (laughs)   I wouldn't even knowwhat to do with myself. I would freak out. I wouldn't know how to    You wouldn't know howto be you, yeah, I know. This is amazing though, isn't it? Amazing, like you havethe choice to do it. But one of my favorite... Just on the question of beauty, one of my favorite fashion designers of all time is Alexander McQueen. And he was really phenomenal, but like his early... And actually, I kind of usedlike what happened to him in the fashion industryas a coping mechanism with our paper when... Like the nature paper in the fall when everyone was sayingit was controversial and how terrible thatlike, you know like... But controversial is good, right? But like when Alexander McQueen,you know, first came out with his fashion lines, hewas mixing horror and beauty, and people were horrified. It was so controversial. Like it was macabre. He had like... You know, like it looked likethere were blood on the models and like    [Lex] That is beautiful. We're just looking at some pictures here.   Yeah, no, I mean his stuff is amazing. His first like runway line,I think, was called Nihilism. I don't know if you could find it. You know, I mean he was really dramatic. He carried a lot of trauma with him. There you go, that's... Yeah. Yeah.  Wow.   But he changed the fashion industry. His stuff became very popular.   That's a good outfit toshow up to a party. (laughs)   Right, right. But this gets at the question like, is that horrific or is it beautiful? And I think, you know,he had a traumatic... He ended up committing suicide, and actually he left his death note on the descent of man. So he was a really deep person.   So I mean great fashion certainly has that kind of depth to it.   Yeah, it sure does. So I think it's theintellectual pursuit, right? Like it's not... So this is like very highly intellectual, and I think it's a lot likehow I play with language, is the same way that I play with fashion, or the same way that I play with ideas in theoretical physics. Like there's always this space that you can just push things just enough. So they look like somethingsomeone thinks is familiar but they're not familiar, and yeah, and I think that's really cool.   It seems like beauty doesn'thave much function, right? But it seems to alsohave a lot of influence on the way we   It has tons of function. What do you mean it doesn't have function?   I guess sexual selectionincorporates beauty somehow. But why? Because beauty is a signof health or something? I don't even    Oh, evolutionarily? Maybe. But then beauty becomes asignal of other things, right? So it's really not like... And then beauty becomes an adaptive trait, so it can change with different... Like, you know, maybesome species would think, well you thought the frog having babies come outof its back was beautiful and I thought it was grotesque. Like there's not a universaldefinition of what's beautiful. It is something that isdependent on your history and how you interact with the world. And I guess what I like about beauty, like any other concept, iswhen you turn it on its head. So, you know, maybe the traditionalconception of, you know, why women wear makeup andthey dress certain ways is because they wanna look beautiful and, you know, pleasing to people. And I just like to do it'cause it's a confidence thing. It's about embodying theperson that I want to be and about owning that person, and then the way that peopleinteract with that person is very different thanif I didn't have the... Like, if I wasn't usingthat attribute as part of... And obviously, that's influencedby the society I live, and like what's aestheticallypleasing things. But it's interesting to beable to turn that around and not have it necessarilybe about the aesthetics, but about the power dynamicsthat the aesthetics create.   But you're saying there'ssome function to beauty, in that way. In the way you're describing, and the dynamic it createsin the social interaction.   Well the point is, you're saying it's an adaptive trait for like sexual selection or something. And I'm saying that the adaptation that beauty confers isfar richer than that. And some of the adaptationis about social hierarchy and social mobility andjust plain social dynamics. Like why do some people dress goth? It's 'cause they identify with a community and a culture associated with that, and they get, you know... And that's a beautiful aesthetic. It's a different aesthetic,some people don't like it.   So it has the samerichness as does language.   Yes.  It's the same kind of    Yes, and I think toofew people think about the way that they... The aesthetics they buildfor themselves in the morning and how they carry it in the world, and the way that otherpeople interact with that, because they put clothes on, and they don't think aboutclothes as carrying function.   Let's jump from beauty to language. There's so many ways toexplore the topic of language. You called it... You said that language is parts of language or language in itself, and the mechanism of languageis a kind of living life form. You've tweeted a lot about thisin all kinds of poetic ways. Let's talk about thecomputation aspect of it. You tweeted, "The worldis not a computation, but computation is ourbest current language for understanding the world. It is important we recognize this so we can start to see thestructure of our future languages that will allow us to see deeper than computation allows us." So what's the use of language in helping us understandand make sense of the world?   I think one thing that I feel like I notice much more viscerally than I feel like I hearother people describe is that the representations in our mind and the way that we use language are not the things like... Actually, I mean, thisis an important point, going back to what Godel did, but also this idea of signs and symbols and all kinds of ways of separating them. There's like the word, right? And then there's like what theword means about the world. And we often confuse those things. And what I feel very viscerally, I almost sometimes think I have some kind of likesynesthesia for language or something, and I justlike don't interact with it like the way that other people do. But for me, words are objects, and the objects are not thethings that they describe, they have like a differentontology to them. Like they're physical things, and they carry causationand they can create meaning, but they're not what we think they are. And also like the internalrepresentations in our mind, like the things I'm seeing about this room are probably, you know, likethey're small projection of the things that areactually in this room. And I think we have such a difficult time moving past the way thatwe build representations in the mind, and the way that westructure our language, to realize that those are approximations to what's out there, and they're fluid, and wecan play around with them, and we can see deeperstructure underneath them, that I think, like, we're missing a lot.   Yeah, but also the lifeof the mind is in some ways richer than the physical reality.   Sure.  What's going on in your mind, it might be a projection    Right.  Actually here, but there's also all kinds ofother stuff going on there.   Yeah, for sure. I love this essay by Poincare about like mathematical creativity, where he talks about thissort of like frothing of all these things, and then like somehow youbuild theorems on top of it, and they become kind of concrete. But like, and I also thinkabout this with language, it's like there's a lot ofstuff happening in your mind, but you have to compress itin this few sets of words to try to convey it to someone. So it's a compactification of the space, and it's not a very efficient one. And I think just recognizing that there's a lot that'shappening behind language is really important. I think this is one of the great things about the existential traumaof large language models, I think is the recognition that language is notthe only thing required. Like there's something underneath it. Not by everybody.   Can you just speak to the feeling you have whenyou think about words? So is there... Like what's the magic of words to you? Is it like... It almost sometimes feels likeyou're playing with it? Like    [Sara] Yeah, I was just gonnasay it's like a playground.   But you're almost like... I think one of the things you enjoy, maybe I'm projecting, is deviating, like using words in waysthat not everyone uses them. Like slightly sort of deviatingfrom the norm a little bit.   I love doing that in everything I do, but especially with language.   But not so far thatit doesn't make sense.   Exactly.  So you're always like tethered to reality, to the norm, but like are playing with it, like basically fucking withpeople's minds a little bit. I mean like, you know, and in so doing, creating a different perspective on another thing that'sbeen previous explored in a different way.   Yeah, it's literallymy favorite thing to do.   Yeah. Use words as one way to make people think.   Yeah, so I, you know... A lot of my sort of like, what happens in my mind whenI'm thinking about ideas is I've been presentedwith this information about how people think about things, and I try to go aroundto different communities and hear the ways that different... Whether it's like, you know, hanging out with a bunch of artists or philosophers or scientists, thinking about things, like they all thinkabout it different ways, and then I just try to figure out like, how do you take the structure of the way that we're talking about it and turn it slightly, so you have all the same pieces that everybody sees are there, but the descriptionthat you've come up with seems totally different. So they can understand that there's... Like they understand thepattern you're describing, but they never heard thestructure underlying it described the way that you describe it.   Is there words or terms you remember that disturbed people the most? Maybe the positive sense of disturbed. Assembly theory, I suppose, is one.   Yeah, I mean the first couple sentences of that paper disturbed people a lot, and I think they werereally carefully constructed in exactly this kind of way.   What was that? Let me look it up.   Oh, it was really fun. But I think it'sinteresting, 'cause I do... You know, sometimes I'mvery upfront about it. I say I'm gonna use the same word in probably six differentways in a lecture, and I will.   You write, "Scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution with immutable laws of theuniverse defined by physics. These laws underpin life's origin, evolution and the " (Sara faintly speaking)   [Sara] When he was here too. (laughs)   "The development of human culture." Well he was... I think your for wordsruns deeper than Lee's.   Yeah, for sure. I mean this is part of the sort of brilliant thing aboutour collaboration is, you know, complimentary skillsets. So I love playing with theabstract space of language, and it's a really interesting playground when I'm working with Lee, because he thinks at a much deeper level of abstraction than canbe expressed by language. And the ideas we work on are hard to talk about for that reason.   What do you think aboutcomputation as a language?   I think it's a very poor language. A lot of people thinkis a really great one, but I think it has some nice properties, but I think the feature of itthat you know is compelling is this kind of idea of universality, that like you can... If you have a language, you can describe thingsin any other language.   Well, for me, one of the people who kind of revealed theexpressive power of computation, aside from Alan Turing, is Stephen Wolfram, throughall the explorations of like cellular automata type of objects that he did in a new kindof science and afterwards. So what did he get from that? Like the kind of computational worlds that are revealed through even something as simpleas cellular automata. Like, it seems likethat's a really nice way to explore languages that are far outside our human languages, and do so rigorously, and understand how thosekinds of complex systems can interact with each other, can emerge, all that kind of stuff.   I don't think that they'reoutside our human languages. I think they define the boundary of the space of human languages. They allow us to explorethings within that space, which is also fantastic. But I think there is aset of ideas that takes... And Stephen Wolfram hasworked on this quite a lot and contributed very significantly to it. And you know, I reallylike some of the stuff that Stephen's doing withlike his physics project, but don't agree with a lotof the foundations of it. But I think the space isreally fun that he's exploring. You know, there's this assumption that computation is atthe base of reality, and I kind of see it at the topof reality, not at the base, because I think computationwas built by our biosphere. It's something that happened after many billion years of evolution, and it doesn't happen inevery physical object. It only happens in some of them. And I think one of the reasons that we feel like theuniverse is computational is because it's so easy for us as things that have the theoryof computation in our minds, and actually in some sense, it might be related to thefunctioning of our minds and how we build languagesto describe the world and sets of relationsto describe the world. But it's easy for us togo out into the world and build computers, and then we mistakeour ability to do that, with assuming that theworld is computational. And I'll give you a really simple example. This one came from John Conway. I, one time had a conversation with him, which was really delightful. He was really fun. But he was pointing out that if you, you know, string lightsin a barn, you know, you can program them to have your favorite one dimensional CA, and you might even be ableto make them, you know, do a like... Be capable of universal computation. Is universal computation afeature of the string lights?   Well, no.  No, it's probably not. It's a feature of the factthat you as a programmer had a theory that you could embed in the physical architectureof the string lights. Now what happens though is we get confused bythis kind of distinction between us as agents in the world that actually can transfer things that life does onto otherphysical substrates, with what the world is. And so for example, you'llsee people, you know, studying the mathematics ofchemical reaction networks and saying, "Well, chemistryis turning universal," or studying the laws of physics and saying, "The laws ofphysics are turning universal." But anytime that you wanna do that, you always have toprepare an initial state. You have to, you know... You have to constrain the rule space, and then you have to actually be able to demonstrate theproperties of computation. And all of that requires an agent or a designer to be able to do that.   But it gives you anintuition if you look at a 1D or 2D cellular automata, it allows you to build an intuition of how you can have complexity emerge from very simple beginnings, very simple initial conditions.   I think that's the intuition that people have derived from it. The intuition I get from cellular automata is that the flat spaceof an initial condition in a fixed dynamical law is not rich enough to describe an open ended generation process. And so the way I see cellular automata, is they're embedded slices in a much larger causal structure. And if you wanna lookat a deterministic slice of that causal structure,you might be able to extract a set of consistent rules that you might call a cellular automata, but you could embed themas much larger space, that's not dynamical and isabout the causal structure and relations between allof those computations, and that would be the spacecellular automata live in. And I think that's the spacethat Stephen is talking about, when he talks about his Ruliad and these hypergraphs of allthese possible computations. But I wouldn't takethat as my base reality, because I think again, computation itself, this abstract property, computation, is not at the base of reality.   Look, can we just lingeron that Ruliad, this    [Sara] Yeah, one Ruliadadd to rule them all.   Yeah, so what... This is part of Wolfram    Yeah.  Physics project. It's what he calls theentangled limit of everything that is computationally possible.   Yeah.  So what's your problem with the Ruliad?   Well, it's interesting. So Stephen came to a workshopwe had in the Beyond Center in the fall, and the workshop theme was, "Mathematics: Is It Evolved or Eternal." And he gave a talk about the Ruliad, and he was talking about how,you know, a lot of the things that we talk about in the Beyond Center, like does reality have a bottom? You know, if it has a bottom, what is it? You know, like what's the    I need to go to   We'll have you to one sometime.   This is great. Does reality have a bottom?   Yeah, so we had one that was... It was called infiniteturtles are ground truth. And it was really just about this issue. But the thing that was interesting, I think Stephen was tryingto make the argument that, you know, fundamentalparticles aren't fundamental, gravitation is not fundamental. You know, these are just turtles, and computation is fundamental. And I just, I rememberpointing out to him, I was like, "Well,computation is your turtle." And I think it's a weird turtle to have.   First of all, isn't itokay to have a turtle?   It's totally fine to have a turtle. Everyone has a turtle. You can't build a theory without a turtle.   Yep.  It's just... So it depends on theproblem you wanna describe. And actually, the reasonI can't get behind Stephen's ontology is I don't know what questionhe's trying to answer. And without a question to answer, I don't understand why you'rebuilding a theory of reality.   And the question you'retrying to answer is    What life is.  What life is, which another simpler way of phrasing that is how did life originate?   Well, I started workingon the origin of life, and I think what my challenge was there, was no one knew what life was. And so you can't reallytalk about the origination of something if you don't know what it is. And so the way I would approach it is, if you wanna understand what life is, then proving that physics issolving the origin of life. So there's the theory of what life is, but there's the actual demonstration that that theory is anaccurate description of the phenomena you aim to describe. So again, they're the same problem. It's not like I candecouple origin of life from what life is. It's like that is the problem. And the point I guess I'm making about having a question is, no matter what slice of reality you take, what regularity of natureyou're gonna try to describe, there will be an abstraction that unifies that structure of reality, hopefully. And that will have afundamental layer to it, right? 'Cause you have to explain something in terms of something else. So if I wanna explain life for example, then my fundamental description of nature has to be something I think that has to do with time being fundamental. But if I wanted to describe, I don't know, the sort of interactions ofmatter and light, you know, I have elementaryparticles be fundamental. If I wanna describe electricity and magnetism in the 1800s, I have to have wavesbe fundamental, right? So like you... Or in quantum mechanics, like it's a wave functionthat's fundamental, 'cause that's the sortof explanatory paradigm of your theory. So I guess I don't knowwhat problem saying, "Computation is fundamental" solves.   Doesn't he want to understand how does the basic quantum mechanics and general relativity emerge?   Yeah, but that   And cause time    Right, so I think   Then that doesn't really answer an important question for us?   Well, I think that the issue is, general relativity and quantummechanics are expressed in mathematical languages, and then computation isa mathematical language. So you're basically saying that maybe there's a moreuniversal mathematical language for describing theories ofphysics that we already know. That's an important question, and I do think that'swhat Steven's trying to do and do well. But then the question becomes, does that formulation ofa more universal language for describing the laws ofphysics that we know now tell us anything new aboutthe nature of reality? Or is it a language?   And to you, languages are fundamental... It can't be fundamental.   The language itself isnever the fundamental thing. It's whatever it's describing.   So one of the possibletitles you were thinking about originally for the book is"The Hard Problem of Life," sort of reminiscent of thehard problem of consciousness. So you are saying that assembly theory is supposed to be answering thequestion about what is life. So let's go to the other hard problems. You also say that's theeasiest of the hard problems, is the hard problem of life. So what do you think isthe nature of intelligence and consciousness? You think something like assembly theory can help us understand that?   I think if assembly theory is an accurate depictionof the physics of life, it should shed a lot oflight on those problems. And in fact, I sometimes wonder if the problems of consciousness and intelligence are at all different than the problem of life generally. And I'm of two minds of it, but I in general try to... You know, like the process of my thinking is trying to regularizeeverything into one theory. So pretty much everyinteraction I have is like, "Oh, how do I fold that into..." And like, so I'm just buildingthis giant abstraction, that's basically trying totake every piece of data I've ever gotten in my brain into a theory of what life is. And consciousness and intelligence are obviously some of themost interesting things that life has manifest. And so I think they're very telling about some of the deeper featuresabout the nature of life.   It does seem like they'reall flavors of the same thing. But it's interesting towonder like at which stage does something that wewould recognize as life, in a sort of canonical, silly human way, and something that we wouldrecognize as intelligence. At which stage does that emerge? Like at which assemblyindex does that emerge? And at which assemblyindex is a consciousness something that we wouldcanonically recognize as consciousness?   Is this the use... Like this use of flavors, the same as you meant when you were talkingabout flavors of alien... Like alien life.   Yeah, sure. Yeah. I mean it's same as theflavors of ice cream and the flavors of fashion.   Yeah, like, but we weretalking about in terms of colors and like very nondescript. But the way that you justtalked about flavors now is more in like the space ofconsciousness and intelligence. It was kind of like much more specific.   It'd be nice if there'sa formal way of expressing    Quantifying flavors?  Quantifying flavors.   Yeah.  It seems like, I would order it life,consciousness, intelligence probably. As like the order in which things emerge, and they're all just the same    They're the same thing.  We're using the word life differently here. I mean life sort of, when I'm talking about, what is a living versus a non living thing at a bar with a person, I'm already like four or fivedrinks in, that kind of thing.   Just that. (laughs)  Like we're not being too philosophical. Like here's the thing that moves, and here's the thing that doesn't move. But maybe consciousness precedes that. It's a weird dance there with like... Is life proceed consciousness or consciousness proceed life. And I think thatunderstanding of what life is in the way you're doing, will help us disentangle that   Depending on what you wanna explain. As I was saying before, you have to assumesomething's fundamental. And so because people can'texplain consciousness, there's a temptation for some people to wanna take consciousnessas fundamental, and assume everything elseis derived out of that. And then you get some people that wanna assumeconsciousness preceded life. And I don't find either of those views particularly illuminating, I think... 'Cause I don't wanna assume a feminology before I explain a thing. And so what I've tried really hard to do is not assume, that Ithink life is anything, except hold on to sort of the patterns and structures that seem tobe the sort of consistent ways that we talk about this thing, and then try to build aphysics that describes that. And I think that's a reallydifferent approach than saying, you know, "Consciousness is this thing, you know, we all feel andexperience about things." I would wanna understand the regularities associated with that, and build a deeperstructure underneath that, and build into it. I wouldn't wanna assume that thing and that I understand that thing, which is usually how Isee people talk about it.   The difference betweenlife and consciousness.   Yeah.  Which comes first.   Yeah, so I think ifyou're thinking about this sort of thinking about living things as these giant causal structures, or these objects that are deep in time, or whatever language we endup using to describe it, it seems to me thatconsciousness is about... The fact that we havea conscious experience is because we are thesetemporally extended objects. So consciousness and the abstraction that we have in our minds is actually a manifestationof all the time that's rolled up in us, and it's just because we're so huge, that we have this very large inner space that we're experiencing, that's not... And it's also separated offfrom the rest of the world because we're the separate thread in time. And so our consciousnessis not exactly shared with anything else, because nothing else occupiesthe same part of time that we occupy. But I can understand something about you maybe being conscious because you and I didn'tseparate that far in the past, in terms of our causal histories. So in some sense we caneven share experiences with each other through language, because of that sort ofoverlap in our structure.   Well then if consciousness is merely temporal separateness, then that comes before life.   It's not merely temporal separateness, it's about the depth in that time. So it's   Yes.   The reason that my conscious experience is not the same as yours isbecause we're separated in time. The fact that I havea conscious experience is because I'm an objectthat's super deep in time, so I'm huge in time, and that means that there's a lot there that I am basically in somesense, a universe onto myself, because my structure is so large relative to the amountof space that I occupy.   But it feels like that's possible to do before you get anything like bacteria.   I think there's a horizon, and I don't know howto articulate this yet, it's a little bit like thehorizon at the origin of life, where the space insidea particular structure becomes so large that it has some access to a space that doesn't feel as physical. It's almost like thisidea of counterfactuals. So I think like the pasthistory of your horizon is just much largerthan can be encompassed in like a small configuration of matter. So you can like pull thisstuff into existence. This property is maybea continuous property, but there's something really different about human level physical systems, and human level abilityto understand reality. I really love David Deutsch's conception of universal explainers, and that's related to thetheory of universal computation. And I think there's sometransition that happens there. But maybe to describethat a little bit better, what I can also say is like, what intelligence is in this framework? So you have these objects that are, you know, large in time. They were selected to exist by constraining thepossible space of objects to this particular... Like all of the matter is funneled into this particularconfiguration of object over time, and so these objectsarise through selection, but the more selection thatyou have embedded in you, the more possible selectionyou have on your future. And so selection and evolution, we usually think about in the past sense, where selection happened in the past, but objects that are highdensity configurations of matter that have a lot of selection in them are also selecting agents in the universe. So they actually embodythe physics of selection, and they can select on possible futures. And I guess what I'm sayingwith respect to consciousness and the experience we have, is that there's somethingvery deep about that structure and the nature of how weexist in that structure that has to do with howwe're navigating that space, and how we generate that space, and how we continue topersist in that space.   Is there shortcuts we can take to artificially engineeringliving organisms? Artificial life, artificial consciousness, artificial intelligence. So maybe just looking pragmatically at the LLMs we have now, do you think those canexhibit qualities of life, qualities of consciousness, qualities of intelligence in the way we think of intelligence?   I mean I think they already do, but not in the way Ihear popularly discussed. So they're obviouslysignatures of intelligence and a part of a ecosystemof intelligence systems. But I don't know thatindividually, you know, I would assign all the propertiesto them that people have. It's a little like, so, you know, we talked about thehistory of eyes before, and like how eyes scaled upinto technological forms, and language has also had areally interesting history, and got much more interesting, I think, once we started writing it down, and then, you know, ininventing books and things. But like, you know, everytime that we started storing language in a new way, you know, where we're kind ofexistentially traumatized by it. So like, you know, the idea of writtenlanguage was traumatic, because it seemed like thedead were speaking to us even though they were deceased, and books were traumatic because, you know, like suddenlythere were lots of copies of this information available to everyone and it was gonna somehow dilute it. And large language modelsare kind of interesting, because they don't feel as static. They're very dynamic. But if you think about language in the way I was describing it before as, language is this verylarge in time structure, and before it had beensomething that was distributed over human brains as a dynamic structure, and occasionally westore components of that very large dynamic structure in books or in written language. Now we can actually store the dynamics of that structure in a physical artifact, which is a large language model. And so I think about it almost like the evolutionof genomes in some sense, where, you know, there might've been like really primitive genes onthe first living things, and they didn't storea lot of information, or they were like really messy. And then we, you know, like by the time you getto the eukaryotic cell, you have this reallydynamic genetic architecture that's read writeable, right? And has all of these different properties. And I think large language models are kind of like thegenetic system for language in some sense, where it's allowing a sort of archiving that's highly dynamic. And I think it's very paradoxical to us, because obviously in human history, we haven't been used toconversing with anything that's not human. But now we can converse basically with a crystallizationof human language in a computer, that's ahighly dynamic crystal, because it's a crystallization in time of this massive abstract structure that's evolved over human history, and is now put into a small device.   I think crystallization kind of implies a limit on its capabilities.   I think there's not a... I mean it very purposefully, because a particularinstantiation of a language model trained on a particular data set becomes a crystal of thelanguage at that time it was trained, but obviously we'reiterating with the technology and evolving it.   I guess the question is, when you crystallize it,when you compress it, when you archive it, you're archiving some slice of the collective intelligence  Yes. of the human species.  That's right.   And the question is,like how powerful is that?   Right? It's a societallevel technology, right? We've actually put collectiveintelligence in a box.   Yeah, I mean, how much smarter is thecollective intelligence of humans versus a single human? And that's the question of AGI versus human level intelligence. Super human level intelligence versus human level intelligence. Like how much smarter can this thing... When done well, when we solve a lot of thecomputation complexities, maybe there's some data complexities, and how to really archive this thing, crystallize this thing really well.   Yeah.  How powerful is this thing gonna be? Like what's your thought?   I actually... I don't like the sort oflanguage we use around that, and I think the language really matters. So I don't know how to talk about how much smarter one humanis than another, right? Like usually we talk about abilities or particular talent someone has. And you know, going back to,you know, David Deutsch's idea of universal explainers, it like... You know, adopting theview that, you know, we're the first, you know, kinds of structuresour biosphere has built that can understand the rest of reality. We have this universalcomprehension capability. You know, he makes an argument that basically, we're the first things that actually are capableof understanding anything. It doesn't mean an individualunderstands everything, but like we have that capability. And so there's not adifference between that and what people talk about with AGI. In some sense, AGI isa universal explainer, but you know, like itmight be that a computer is much more efficient at doing, you know, I don't know, primefactorization or something, than a human is, but it doesn't mean thatit's necessarily smarter or has a broader reachof the kind of things that it can understand, than a human does. And so I think we reallyhave to think about, is it a level shift? Or is it, we're enhancing certain kindsof capabilities humans have in the same way that we enhanced eyesight by making telescopes and microscopes. Are we enhancing capabilitieswe have into technologies, and the entire global ecosystemis getting more intelligent? Or is it really that we're building some super machine in a box that's gonna be smart and kill everybody? That sounds like a science... It's not even a science fiction narrative, it's a bad science fiction narrative. I just don't think it's actually accurate to any of the technologies we're building, or the way that we shouldbe describing them. It's not even how we shouldbe describing ourselves.   So the benevolence stories,there's a benevolence system that's able to transform our economy, our way of life by just, youknow, 10X ing the GDP of    Well, these are human questions, right? I don't think they'renecessarily questions that we're gonna like outsource to an artificial intelligence. I think what is happening and will continue to happen, is there's a co evolution between humans and technology that's happening. And we're coexisting inthis ecosystem right now, and we're maintaininga lot of the balance, and for the balance toshift to the technology would require some very bad human actors, which is a real risk. Or some sort of... I don't know, some sortof dynamic that favors... Like I just don't know how that plays out without human agency actually trying to putit in that direction.   It could also be how rapid the rate    The rapid rate is scary. So like, I think thethings that are, you know, terrifying are, you know,the ideas of deep fakes or you know, like, you know, all the kinds of issuesthat become legal issues about artificialintelligence technologies. And using them to control weapons or using them for, you know, like child pornographyor you know, like the... Or like, you know, fakingout that someone's, you know, loved one was kidnapped orkilled and it, you know... Like, there's all kinds of things that are super scary in this landscape. And all kinds of newlegislation needs to be built, and all kinds of guardrailson the technology to make sure that people don'tabuse it need to be built, and that needs to happen. And I think one function of sort of the artificialintelligence doomsday, sort of, part of our culture right now, is it's sort of our immuneresponse to knowing that's coming and we're over scaring ourselves, so we try to act morequickly, which is good. But I just, you know, it'sabout the words that we use versus the actual thingshappening behind the words. I think one thing that's good is when people are talkingabout things different ways, it makes us think about them. And also when things areexistentially threatening, we wanna pay attention to those. But the ways that they'reexistentially threatening, and the ways that we'reexperiencing existential trauma, I don't think that we'rereally gonna understand for another century or two, if ever. And I certainly think they're not the way that we're describing them now.   Well, creating existential trauma is one of the things thatmakes life fun, I guess.   Yeah, it's just what wedo to ourselves. (laughs)   It gives us really exciting,big problems to solve.   Yeah, for sure.  Do you think we'll see these AI systems become conscious, or convince us that they're conscious, and then maybe we'll haverelationships with them? Romantic relationships?   Well, I think people are gonna have romantic relationships with them, and I also think that some people would be convinced already that they're conscious. But I think in order... You know, what does ittake to convince people that something is conscious? I think that we actuallyhave to have an idea of what we're talking about, that we have to have a theory that explains when thingsare conscious or not, that's testable, right? And we don't have one right now. So I think until we have that, it's always gonna bethis sort of gray area, where some people think it hasn't, and some people think it doesn't, because we don't actually know what we're talking aboutthat we think it has.   So do you think it's possibleto get out of the gray area and really have a formaltest for consciousness?   For sure.  And for life, as you were    For sure.  As we've been talking about for assembly theory?   [Sara] Yeah.   Consciousness is a tricky one.   It is a tricky one. I mean, that's why it'scalled the hard problem of consciousness, because it's hard. And you know, it might even be outside of the purview of science, which means that we can't understand it in a scientific way. There might be other waysof coming to understand it, but those may not be the ones that we necessarily wantfor technological utility, or for developing laws with respect to, because the laws are, you know, the things that are gonnagovern the technology.   Well I think that's actually where the hard problem of consciousness, a different hard problemof consciousness is that, I fear that humans will resist. That's the last thing they will resist, is calling something else conscious.   Oh, that's interesting. I think it depends on the culture though, because I mean, somecultures already think like everything's imbued with,you know, a life essence or a kind of conscious.   I don't think thosecultures have nuclear weapons.   No, they don't, and they're probably not building the most advanced technologies.   The cultures that are primed for destroying the other, constructing a veryeffective propaganda machine of what the other is, the group to hate, are the cultures that I worry would    Yeah, I know.  Would be very resistant to label something, and to sort of acknowledgethe consciousness laden in a thing thatwas created by us humans.   And so what do youthink the risks are there? That the conscious thingswill get angry with us and fight back?   No, that we would torture and kill conscious beings.   Oh yeah. I think we do that quitea lot anyway, without... I mean it goes back to your... And I don't know how to feel about this, but you know, like we talked already about the predator prey thing that like, in some sense, you know, being alive requires eatingother things that are alive. And even if you're a vegetarian or you know, like try to have like... Like you're still eatingliving things, yeah.   So maybe part of the story of Earth will involve a predatorprey dynamic between humans    That struggle for existence.  And human creations.   Yeah.  And all of that is part of the technosphere.  But I don't like thinking about them as like, our technologies as a separate species. 'Cause this again goesback to this sort of levels of selection issue. And you know, if you thinkabout humans individually alive, you miss the fact thatsocieties are also alive. And so I think about itmuch more in the sense of... An ecosystem's not the right word, but we don't have the right words for these things of like... And this is why I talkabout the technosphere, it's a system that is bothhuman and technological. It's not human or technological. And so this is the part thatI think we are really good for the like... And this is driving in part a lot of the sort of attitude of like, "I'll kill you firstwith my nuclear weapons." We're really good atidentifying things as other, we're not really good atunderstanding when we're the same, or when we're part of an integrated system that's actually functioning together in some kind of cohesive way. So even if you look at like, you know, the division in American politicsor something, for example, it's important that there's multiple sides that are arguing with each other, because that's actually howyou resolve society's issues. It's not like a bad feature. I think like some of thesort of extreme positions and like the way people talkabout it are maybe not ideal, but that's how societies solve problems. What it looks like for an individual is really different thanthe societal level outcomes. And the fact that like, there is... I don't wanna call itcognition or computation, I don't know what you call it, but like there is a process playing out in the dynamics of societies, that we are all individual actors in, and like, we're not part of that. You know, like it requiresall of us acting individually, but like this higher level structure is playing out some things, and like things are getting solved for it to be able to maintain itself. And that's the level thatour technologies live at. They don't live at our level, they live at the societal level, and they're deeply integratedwith the social organism, if you wanna call it that. And so I really get upsetwhen people talk about the species of artificial intelligence. I'm like, "You mean welive in an ecosystem of all these kind of intelligent things and these animating technologiesthat we're, you know, in some sense helping to come alive. We are generating them, but it's not like the biosphere eliminated all of its past history when it invented a new species." All of these things get scaffolded, and we're also augmenting ourselves at the same time that we'rebuilding technologies. I don't think we can anticipate what that system's gonna look like.   So in some fundamental way, you always want to bethinking about the planet as one organism.   The planet is one living thing.   What happens when itbecomes multi planetary? Is it still just the    Still the same causal chain.  Same causal chain.   It's like when thefirst cell split into two. That's what I was talking about. When a planet reproduces itself, the technosphere emergesenough understanding. It's like this recursive... Like the entire history oflife is just recursion, right? So you have an original life event. It evolves for 4 billionyears, at least on our planet. It evolves the technosphere, the technologies themselvesstart to become... Having this property we call life, which is the phase we're undergoing now. It solves the origin of itself, and then it figures outhow that process all works, understands how to make more life, and then can copy itselfonto another planet. So the whole structurecan reproduce itself. And so the origin of lifeis happening again right now on this planet in the technosphere, with the way that our planet is undergoing another transition. Just like at the origin of life when geochemistry cantransition to biology, which is the global... For me, it was a planetaryscale transition. It was a multi scale thing, that happened from the scale of chemistry, all the way to planetary cycles. It's happening now, all the way from individualhumans to the internet, which is a global technology, and all the other things. Like there's this multi scaleprocess that's happening and transitioning us globally. And it is really likea dramatic transition. It's happening really fast.   And you think   And we're living in it.   You think thistechnosphere that we created, this increasingly complex technosphere will spread to other planets. It'll just be   I hope so. I think so   You think we'll become a typetwo Kardashev civilization?   I don't really like the Kardashev scale, and it goes back to like, I don't like a lot of thenarratives about life, 'cause they're very like, youknow, survival of the fittest, energy consuming this,that and the other thing. It's very like, I don'tknow, sort of old world, you know, like conqueror mentality.   What's the alternative to that exactly?   I mean, I think it does require life to use new energy sources inorder to expand the way it is. So that part's accurate. But I think this sort of process of life like being the mechanism that the universecreatively expresses itself, generates novelty, explores the space of the possible, is really the thing that'smost deeply intrinsic to life. And so, you know, these sort of energy consuming scales of technology, I think is missing thesort of actual feature that's most prominent about any alien life that we might find, which is that it's literally our universe, our reality, trying tocreatively express itself, and trying to find out what can exist and trying to make it exist.   See but past a certain levelof complexity, unfortunately, maybe you can correctme, but we're built... All complex life on Earth is built on a foundation ofthat predator prey dynamic.   Yes.  And so like, I don't know if we can escape that. I don't know   No, we can't. But this is why I'm okay with having a finite lifetime. And, you know, one of the reasons I'm okay with that, actually   Yeah.   Goes back to this issue of the fact that we're resource bound. We live in a... You know, like we have afinite amount of material, whatever way you wanna define material. I think like for me, youknow, material is time, material is information, but we have a finite amount of material. If time is a generating mechanism, it's always gonna be finite, because the universe is, you know, like it's a resourcethat's getting generated, but it has a size. Which means that all thethings that could exist don't exist, and in fact, most of them never will. So death is a way tomake room in the universe for other things to exist that wouldn't be able to exist otherwise. So if the universe, overits entire temporal history, wants to maximize the number of things... Wants is a hard word, maximize is a hard word, allthese things are approximate, but wants to maximize thenumber of things that can exist, the best way to do it is to make recursively embeddedstacked objects like us, that have a lot of structureand a small volume of space. And to have those thingsturn over rapidly, so you can create asmany of them as possible.   So there for sure is a bunch of those kinds ofthings throughout the universe.   Hopefully. Hopefully our universeis teaming with life.   This is like early on inthe conversation you mentioned that we really don't understand much. Like there's mystery all around us.   Yes.  If you had to like bet money on it, like what percent? So like say a million years from now, the story of scienceand human understanding that started on Earth, is written. Like, what chapter are we on? Is this like 1%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 90%? How much do we understand? Like the big stuff? Not like the details of like... Like big important questions    Yeah.  And ideas.   I think we're in our twenties and    20% of the 20?  No, like age wise. Let's say we're in our twenties, but the lifespan is gonnakeep getting longer.   You can't do that.  I can. You know why I use that though? I'll tell you why. Why my brain went there, is because you know, anybody that gets an education in physics, you know, has this sort of trope about how all the greatphysicists did their best work in their twenties, and then you don't doany good work after that. And I always thought it was kind of funny, because for me physics is not complete, it's not nearly complete, but most physiciststhink that we understand most of the structure of reality. And so I think I... Actually, I think I putthis in the book somewhere, but like this idea to me that societies would discovereverything while they're young is very consistent with the way we talkabout physics right now. But I don't think that's actually the way that things are gonna go, and you're finding that people that are making major discoveries are getting older in somesense than they were, and our lifespan is also increasing. So I think there is something about age and your ability to learn, and how much of the world you can see, that's really importantover a human lifespan, but also over the lifespan of societies. And so I don't know howbig the frontier is, I don't actually think it has a limit. I don't believe in infinityas a physical thing, but I think as a receding horizon, I think because theuniverse is getting bigger, you can never know all of it.   Well, I think it's about 1.7%.   1.7, where does that come from?   And it's a finite... I don't know, I just made it up. But it's like   That number had to come from somewhere.   I think seven is the thingthat people usually pick   7%?  So I wanted to say 1%, but I thought it would be funnier    Yeah, I see.  To add a point, you know, so inject alittle humor in there. So the seven is for the humor, one is for how much mysteryI think there is out there.   99% mystery, 1% known?   In terms of like reallybig important questions.   Yeah.  It's like, the list... Say there's gonna be like 200 chapters, like the stuff that's gonna remain true.   But you think thebook has a finite size?   Yeah, yeah.  And I don't. I mean, not that I believe in infinities, but I think the sizeof the book is growing.   Well, the fact that thesize of the book is growing is one of the chapters in the book.   Oh, there you go. Oh, we're being recursive. (laughs)   I think you have to, youcan't have an ever growing book.   Yes, you can.  I mean you just... I mean, I don't even... Because then   Well, you couldn't have been asking this at the origin of life, right? Because obviously, like you wouldn't haveexisted at the origin of life.   Right.  But like the question of intelligence and artificial general... Like those questions did not exist then. And they in part existed because the universe inventeda space for those questions to exist through evolution.   But like, I think thatquestion will still stand a thousand years from now.   It will, but therewill be other questions we can't anticipate now,that we'll be asking.   Yeah, and maybe we'lldevelop the kinds of languages that'll be able to askmuch better questions.   Right, or like the theory oflike gravitation for example. Like when we invented that theory, like we only knew about the planets in our solar system, right? And now, you know, many centuries later, we know about all these planets around other stars and black holes, and other things that wecould never have anticipated. And then we can ask questions about them. You know, like wewouldn't have been asking about singularities and like, can they really be physicalthings in the universe several hundred years agothat question couldn't exist.   Yeah, but it's not... I still think those arechapters in the book. Like I don't get a sense from that.   So do you think the universe has an end? If you think it's a book with an end?   I think the number ofwords required to describe how the universe works has an end, yes. (Lex laughs) Meaning like, I don't careif it's infinite or not.   Right.  As long as the explanation is simple and it exists.   Oh, I see.   And I think there isa finite explanation for each aspect of it. The consciousness, the life.   Yeah.  I mean very probably, there's like some... The black hole thing islike, what's going on there?   Oh, I know.  Where's that going? Like what are they... What? And then you know, why the Big Bang? Like what   Right.   It's probably, there's justa huge number of universes and it's like, universes inside universes   You think so? I think universes insideuniverses is maybe possible.   I just think it's... Every time we assume this is all there is, it turns out there's much more.   The universe is a huge place   And we mostly talked about the past and the richness of the past. But the future, I mean withmany worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, so    Oh, I'm not a many worlds person.   You're not?  No. Are you? How many Lexes are there?   Depending on the day. Well   Do some of them wear yellow jackets?   At the moment you asked the question, there was one. At the moment I'm answering it, there's now near infinity, apparently. I mean the future isbigger than the past, yes?   Yes.  Okay, well there you go. And the past, according toyou, it's already gigantic.   Yeah, but yeah, I mean that's consistentwith many worlds, right? 'Cause like there's thisconstant branching, so. But it doesn't really havea directionality to it. I don't know, many worlds is weird. So my interpretation of reality is like if you folded up like all that bifurcation of many worlds, and you just fold it intothe structure that is you, and you just said, you areall of those many worlds and like that sort of, youknow, like your history, like converged on you. But like you're actually... An object exists that's like... That you know, was selected to exist, and you're self consistentwith the other structures. So like the quantum mechanical reality is not the one that you live in. It's this very deterministic,classical world and you're carving apath through that space. But I don't think thatyou're constantly branching into new spaces. I think you are that space.   Wait, so to you at, at thebottom it's deterministic. I thought you said the universe    No, it's random at the bottom, right? But like this randomness that we see at the bottom of reality,that is quantum mechanics, I think like people haveassumed that is reality. And what I'm saying is like all those things you see in many worlds, all those versions of you, just collect them up and bundle them up, and like they're all you. And what has happened is, you know, like elementary particles don't have... They don't live in adeterministic universe, the things that we studyin quantum experiments, they live in this fuzzy random space. But as that structure collapsed and started to build structuresthat were deterministic and evolved into you, you are a very deterministic,macroscopic object. And you can look down on that universe that doesn't have time init, that random structure. And you can see that allof these possibilities look possible, but they don't look... They're not possible for you, because you're constrained by this giant like causal structural history. So you can't live in all those universes. You'd have to go all the way back to the very beginning of the universe, and retrace everythingagain to be a different you.   So where's the source of the free will for the macro object?   It's the fact that you'redeterministic structure living in a random background, and also, all of thatselection bundled in you, allows you to select on possible futures. So that's where your will comes from, and there's just always alittle bit of randomness because the universe is getting bigger and you know, like this idea that the past and the presentis not large enough yet to contain the future. The extra structure hasto come from somewhere. And some of that is because, outside of those giant causal structures that are things like us, it's fucking random out there, (both laugh) and it's scary, and we're all hanging onto each other, because the only way tohang onto each other, like the only way to exist, is to like clinging on to all of these causal structures that we happen toco inhabitate existence with, and try to keep reinforcingeach other's existence.   All the selection bundled in.   But free will's totallyconsistent with that.   I don't know what I think about that. That's complicated to imagine. Just that little bit ofrandomness is enough. Okay.   Well it's also... It's not just the randomness. There's two features. One is, the randomness helps generate some novelty and some flexibility. But it's also that like, because you're the structurethat's deep in time, you have this combinatorialhistory that's you, and I think about timeand assembly theory, not as linear time, but as combinatorial time. So if you have all of the structure that you're built out of, you in principle, you know, your future can becombinations of that structure. You obviously need to persistyourself as a coherent you, so you wanna optimize for a common, like a future in that combinatorial space that still includes you, most of the time for most of us. And when you make those kinds... And then that gives youa space to operate in, and that's your sort of horizon where your free will can operate, and your free will can't be instantaneous. So for like example, like I'm sitting heretalking to you right now, I can't be in the UK andI can't be in Arizona, but I could plan, I couldexecute my free will over time, because free will is atemporal feature of life, to be there, you know,tomorrow or the next day if I wanted to.   But what about like theinstantaneous decisions you're making? Like to, I don't know... To put your hand on the table, that's    I think those werealready decided a while ago. I don't think that the... I don't think free willis ever instantaneous,   But on a longer time horizon    Yep.  There's some kind of steering going on?  Mm hmm. And who's doing the steering?   You are.  Hmm. And you being this macroobject that encompasses    Or you being Lex. (laughs) Whatever you wanna call it. (laughs)   There you are, assigningwords to things once again.   I know.  Why does anything exist at all?   Ugh, I don't know.  You've kind of taken that as a starting point.   Yeah.  That it exists.   I think that's the hardest question.   Isn't it just hard questionsstacked on top of each other?   It is.  Wouldn't it be the same kind of questionof, what is life? It is the same. Well that's sort of like, I try to fold all of thequestions into that question, 'cause I think that one's really hard, and I think the nature ofexistence is really hard.   You think actually likeanswering, what is life? Will help us understand existence? Maybe it's turtles all the way down and it'll just... Understanding the nature of turtles will help us kind of march down even if we don't have theexperimental methodology of reaching before the Big Bang.   Right. So, well I think there'ssort of two questions embedded here. I think the one that we can'tanswer by answering life is, why certain things exist and others don't. But I think the sort of ultimate question, the sort of like prime mover question of why anything exists, we will not be able to answer.   What's outside the universe?   Oh, there's nothingoutside the universe. So I am a very, like... I am like the most physicalistthat like anyone could be. So like for me, everythingexists in our universe and I like to like think it like, everything exists here. So even when we talk aboutthe multiverse, I don't... Like, to me it's not likethere's all these other universes outside of our universe that exists. The multiverse is a conceptthat exists in human minds here, and it allows us to havesome counterfactual reasoning to reason about our own cosmology, and therefore it's causal in our biosphere to understanding thereality that we live in, and building better theories. But I don't think that themultiverse is something like... And also math. Like I don't thinkthere's a platonic world that mathematical things live in. I think mathematical thingsare here on this planet. Like I don't think it makessense to talk about things that exist outside of the universe. If you're talking about them, you're already talkingabout something that exists inside the universe, andis part of the universe, and is part of like whatthe universe is building.   It all originates here. It all exists here in some    I mean, what else would there be?   There could be things youcan't possibly understand outside of all of thisthat we call the universe.   And you can say that, and that's an interesting philosophy, but again, this is sort oflike pushing on the boundaries of like the way that we understand things. I think it's more constructive to say the fact that I cantalk about those things is telling me something about the structure ofwhere I actually live and where I exist.  Just because it's more constructivedoesn't mean it's true.   Well, it may not be true. It may be something that allowsme to build better theories I can test, to try tounderstand something objective.   And in the end, that's agood way to get to the truth.   Exactly.  Even if you realize    So I can't do experiments   You were wrong in the past.   Yeah. So there's no such thingas experimental Platonism, but if you think math is an object that emerged in our biosphere, you can start experimentingwith that idea. And that to me is really interesting. Like to think about... Well people, I mean, mathematicians do think about math sometimesas an experimental science, but to think about mathitself as a object for study by physicists, rather than a tool physicistsused to describe reality, it becomes the part of realitythey're trying to describe, to me is a deeply interesting inversion.   What to you is most beautiful about this kind of explorationof the physics of life that you've been doing?   I love the way it makes me feel.   And then you have to try to convert the feelings into visuals and the visuals into words?  Yeah. So I think I love... Yeah, I love the way itmakes me feel to have ideas that I think are novel. And I think that the dual side of that is the painful process oftrying to communicate that with other human beings, to test if they have anykind of reality to them. And I also love that process. I love trying to figure out how to explain reallydeep, abstract things that I don't think that we understand, and trying to understandthem with other people. And I also love the shock value of you... Like this kind of idea wewere talking about before, of like being on the boundaryof like what we understand, and so people can kind ofsee what you're seeing, but they haven't eversaw it that way before. And I love the shock valuethat like people have, like that immediate moment of recognizing that there's something beyond the way that they thought about things before. And being able to deliver that to people, I think is one of the biggest joys that I have, it's just like... And maybe it's that sense of mystery, like to share that there's something beyond the frontier of how we understand, and we might be able to see it.   And you get to seethe humans transformed    Yeah.  Like a new idea?   Yes. And I think my greatest wish in life is to somehow contribute to an idea that transforms the way that we think. Like, you know, I havemy problem I wanna solve, but like the thing thatgives me joy about it is really changing something, and ideally getting toa deeper understanding of how the world works and what we are.   Yeah, I would say understandinglife at a deep level    Yeah.  Is probably one of the most exciting problems. One of the most exciting questions. So I'm glad you are tryingto answer just that, and doing it in style. (Sara laughs)   It's the only way to do anything.   Thank you so much forthis amazing conversation. Thank you for being you,Sara.

And now, let me leave you with some words from Charles Darwin. "In the long history ofhumankind and animal kind too, those who learned to collaborate and improvise mosteffectively, have prevailed." Thank you for listening, andhope to see you next time.
