[Music] thank you uh so yeah I'm Sarah Miller I'm working with Professor Brittany Schmidt at Cornell University and I am working to build a global circulation model for the ocean at Europa um so before we move on I wanted to kind of point out the cover image I chose which is primarily because I thought the colors made for a pretty PowerPoint theme and secondarily because it shows some interesting kind of structures that exist on the ice crust on Europa so as you can see it's not a smooth ice skating rink it's a very interesting and geologically active Zone which hints that probably the interior is a dynamic and very interesting place to study which is what I'm going to talk about next before I dive into the science I do want to take a moment to thank my team and kind of the people who have helped me bring my understanding um in this field up so I have a background in fluid dynamics and aerospace engineering which I'll talk a little bit about throughout this talk but these people have been really instrumental in kind of working with me on the planetary aspect as well as my funding sources through an NSF grfp and a NASA finest in an Amelia Earhart fellowship and some wonderful people who support this work okay so as I mentioned uh Europa has a very interesting surface and it hints that there is a dynamic ocean interior and I think that the ocean circulation the physical oceanography piece of this puzzle is a really interesting one in terms of habitability because when we look at Earth's ocean um the transport of heat and salt and nutrients throughout the ocean column is really what sustains our biosphere so I think it has really interesting habitability implications on other planets as well and specifically I want to narrow this down even further the region of our ocean that separates the glacial glacially covered parts of our ocean from the liquid layer that ice ocean boundary layer is really instrumental in setting far field ocean properties so that tiny boundary layer region between the ice and the ocean actually has an outsized effect on affecting Global Mass Water mass transport and so I think that's very much worthy of intense study in the modeling realm for Europa so I'm not the first person to attempt to build a global circulation model for Europa um but the the state of the field is really kind of Divergent so um models of Europa generally fall into one of two categories depending on kind of how you set your boundary conditions and really how you set up this ice ocean interface mathematically so usually there's kind of an outsized effect of either the rotation driven or buoyancy driven so kind of temperature salinity gradients in the model and the results are very different so Global circulation models exist they usually fall into one of these two categories and they do not agree with each other now if we look at terrestrial Ocean Models on the other hand they look very different and that's because they've had a lot more scientific Manpower in years of study and actual data so how nice for them so their models are very sophisticated compared to what we see in planetary Ocean Models that being said there are still kind of parts of Earth's ocean that we don't understand so it's very much ocean modeling is an active area of research and there's still some mechanisms that remain poorly constrained which is really humbling to think about doing this on a body that we have zero data for and know a lot less about but I'm going to try anyway um so let me introduce you to the tool that I'm using so I'm using the MIT General circulation model so it's a 3D circulation model that employs the full non hydrostatic incompressible navier Stokes equations it also has some really interesting and very useful packages for Europa so an ice shelf package um a deep convection package which is really helpful because Europa unlike Earth has a really deep ocean compared to its planetary radius and that is important when you're talking about large scale flow features so I won't kind of dive into the nitty gritty it's written in Fortran um so if you're a modeler you're probably just cringed uh but yeah it's a very powerful very useful tool so there's lots of knobs that you can turn within this model and I'm working on turning kind of all of these through sensitivity studies throughout my PhD but what I want to focus on in this talk is the role of topography underneath the ice shelf so in this case I'm talking about both the small scale topography so surfness roughness surface roughness of the ice which affects things like turbulence in the boundary layer as well as large scale features on the ice that can form large scale flow features now you might be thinking like why would a turbulent boundary layer affect global ocean circulation and specifically habitability for this interest and I want you to remember that the ocean time scales operate a lot faster than planetary time scales and that could be an important link for a habitability argument so quick review of kind of boundary layer of physics um I took out the full equations because they're pretty ugly and I just have these like nice kind of simplified relationships that I want to discuss um so I'm using kind of a widely adopted parameterization called the three equation parameterization it's very creatively named and essentially it's just looking at this fluxes those are those Q values between a solid ice shelf which is fresh water or fresh ice a mixed boundary layer region and then the mixed layer the liquid ocean so we're looking at kind of the three unknowns in these equations are the temperature and salinity of the boundary layer as well as a melt rate or MDOT which is negative if it's melting positive if it's freezing and that's kind of how we're constraining the phase change that's happening at this region so I'm using a model that's um kind of an ongoing International effort within the MIT GCM Community to uh model this kind of physics um for Earth's ocean and so this is a simplified version of that map and so it's a two equation parameterization that's assuming the salinity of the boundary layer and the mixed layer is the same um current research and kind of more recent results since submitting this abstract I've been able to like use the three equation parameterization but those graphs are still pretty ugly so maybe next at gradcon um yeah and kind of one other thing that's very common on Earth but not a great approximation for Europa is that often in Ocean Models the pressure dependence of density is approximated by depth dependence I mentioned that europa's ocean is a lot deeper than Earth's so this is something that I've removed as well because I think no longer holds for europa's ocean so I mentioned it's probably not like a flat ice skating rink under europa's eye shell we don't know what it looks like but it's probably not that beautiful and simple um it's probably not this beautiful and simple either but to start with to kind of demonstrate some of the flow features that might develop with ice shelf topography here's like a very simple ramp that I'm introducing so it's not a global model quite yet it's just a rectangular domain starting at a fixed initial temperature um and we're going to introduce a heat gradient and a flow through ice melting and see what develops so we're seeing some already just with very simple geometry interesting and kind of recognizable flow features so we see the development of what looks kind of like a western boundary current on the left and an ocean gyre on the right and these are happening because there is melting happening at depth so if you remember the phase diagram of water there is a pressure dependence on the melting point of ice and so we see melting happening on the bottom of this ramp and then as the fresh waters Rising along the Melt water the ramp it's circulating and that's creating a circular flow feature this dryer so we have on the left these are just stream functions the barotrope extreme function and then the right and overturning stream function just in a couple different directions so maybe more importantly uh the Melt rate what's happening so we're seeing both regions of melting and freezing The Contours got a little dense for the melting so I just kind of outlined that where that's happening there but that's happening um kind of as the warmer Ocean mixed layer water is interacting with this Frozen ramp and so we see that kind of um already just very simple geometry there's lots of Dynamics happening there's freezing there's melting there's flow features um but this is probably not very realistic maybe more realistic is something like this so this is a almost Global um topography that I stole from what Earth's ice shelves look like I cut out the poles because of convergence issues and it's a pretty coarse resolution but it still captures a lot of the large scale flow features that we see on Earth as well as some turbulence and mixing events effects from small scale features that are missing and so I think it's really important to think that like when you're modeling um heat transfer like your grid resolution is really important so the size of your grid cell in your model affects kind of how quickly heat is transferred through your ocean and so this is really too course to understand um what's happening in turbulence and Boundary layer effects so I'm kind of accommodating that in the model by modifying the MIT GCM to have like spatial grid remeshing so I'm slicing up the grid cells so that I can have melting and freezing happening within a single model run which is not kind of the standard configuration within the boundary layer so this has been kind of very helpful in understanding um turbulence and more quick time scale melting and freezing physics now this is kind of one of several things that needs to happen to have a more realistic ice shells like greater spatial grid density in the boundary layer um there's also but even so you know it's not going to be a simple ramp um there's other things to introduce like salt different heat and salt transfer coefficients um a mushy layer there's interesting work that's being done by this on this by Jacob buffo if you want to look at his work um so in my model currently the ice is assumed as a completely fresh water layer that's probably not the case there might be zones or brines and interesting kind of pockets of heterogeneities that will affect these processes but this is kind of all just taking steps to like introduce more realistic features into an ice shell model and then look at the global circulation effects of those features so kind of to kind of wrap up this little bit that I've discussed um terrestrial models I think can be very valuable in the planetary Community within those models specifically I think there still needs to be a lot of work done on the ice ocean boundary layer which is what I've been focusing on this past year of my PhD and the potential impacts for habitability of this kind of great uh resolution on an ISO student boundary layer could be very important for habitability all right and I'm happy to take questions [Applause] so if you are assuming uh so with the mushy layer you know like a slurry for instance is the Assumption of uh incompressible fluid still valid and does that change that makes never Stokes much more complicated right so how would that really affect the your modeling would you have to change some things or yeah no that's a really good question so um realistically yes you would change uh the kind of forcing equations so the model as it currently runs it assumes that um kind of backing up a little bit the equation of state of seawater is a linear function of salinity so if you introduce something like a brine it's removing that kind of linear assumption that said like the model as it currently stands it does have a solid ice layer so it doesn't look at brine Pockets or mushy layers yet um if you wanted to do that I do think that yeah you'd need to change the equation of State at seawater locally yeah to accommodate those and what about the incompressibility assumption I think that's a small enough one where if you're looking at the effects on overturning in flow it wouldn't have an effect but it would be a very cool sensitivity study so it's a good question thank you thank you sorry a really ignorant question so Europa it seems like there's a very kind of notice notice gradient is that just due to pressure kind of like what what's the middle of Europa oh interesting question okay I think I have um a backup slide that might help so yeah so the mechanisms that are kind of important for Europa Heating and what's sustaining the ocean are like tidal heating that it bottom heating from residual heat of formation internal heat if there is this Dynamic eye shell that's freezing and melting like I think it is then you have heat fluxes from freezing and melting um yeah so there's a lot going on um the kind of Weights of these effects is still very much unknown and so that's why I'm really trying to use observations from Earth so for instance I'm using like turbulent turbulent transfer coefficients of freezing and melting from Antarctic field studies to kind of influence this model but yeah it's really like there's a lot going on so it's really kind of the challenge is trying to figure out which one is driving um the thermal gradient thanks okay we have time for one more question Taylor plattner at Georgia Tech great talk Sarah um you were talking about Brian Pockets to like make it the model more realistic did you have do you plan on doing that with your model and have they done it on earth like with like Earth models have they even thought of like incorporating bride pockets yeah it's a good question so the answer is like no most um like glacial models and Earth Global ocean circulation models don't include brine Pockets because on Earth those are more seen in like Lake environments or kind of like the like hyper saline lakes and Flash bows and lakes that like Jacob works on um they might Europe as a yeah different conditions though um and so they could exist there so at most I think I would do a like a case study on what would happen if Brian Pockets exist so it's something I'm working on now um but it's not something I'd include in every run because it's just still very much an unknown yeah I was going to say that was kind of like a loaded question but I was curious no it's a good question yeah thank you so much for the time [Music] thank you [Music]
