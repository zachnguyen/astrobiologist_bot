[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] greetings friends fellow earthlings and explorers of the unknown welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science as well as the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life I'm your host Dr Graham Lau also known as the cosmo biologist this month we want to highlight one of our past guests actually shared about today's episode so very very a very huge thank you to Morgan cable on Twitter at stars are calling for sharing about this episode you might recall that Morgan was our guest on episode 16 of the show and we talked about worlds like Enceladus and Europa and Titan and so that's especially fitting for today's show which is going to be most excellent I'm super excited tomorrow is the the 368th anniversary of the discovery of the Moon Titan the largest moon of Saturn and indeed the second largest moon of our solar system it is a world that is obscured by a thick hazy atmosphere rich in hydrocarbons and organic molecules and as we'll discuss in today's show there is an upcoming Mission being developed by NASA and through the John Hopkins University Applied Physics laboratory called dragonfly that's going to allow us to better explore the geology the chemistry the atmosphere the world of Titan and so that's super exciting I'm so glad to have today the principal investigator the lead on the team for dragonfly joining us Dr Zibby turtle is here uh Dr Turtle earned her BS in physics at MIT before going on to earn a PhD in planetary science at the University of Arizona she spent some time as a postdoc at U of A as well as with the planetary Science Institute before then joining APL in 2006 she's been involved in a number of missions like Galileo and Cassini the lunar reconnaissance Orbiter the upcoming Europa Clipper and like I said now dragonfly and so thank you so much for joining us for ask an astrobiologist Dr Turtle it's a pleasure to have you here thank you I'm so happy to be here talking with you today uh this is super exciting so tomorrow is the 368th anniversary of the discovery of Titan uh we've had a few spacecraft fly by Titan and one visited in the past but of course this is going to be a really cool Mission with dragonfly uh and with you as the lead um before we jump into my questions though about dragonfly and Titan and all of those cool things one thing we love to do on this show is celebrate the scientists and the career Pathways that we follow to to develop these careers in planetary science and astrobiology and so I'm wondering for our audience could you share with us kind of what was the beginning for you your your science origin story that really got you into this realm of planetary science um yeah absolutely I've I have always been um uh interested in astronomy since since uh since I can remember I don't actually remember learning the names of the planets they've always been kind of part of the part of the geography um my grandma mother knew all the mythology of the you know the constellations my father had majored in astronomy worked for you worked for the Air Force studying atmospheric phenomena uh you're on Earth and so we were always looking up as kids uh my sister and I even had a game called space hop where you got to um uh you would get different uh missions and so it had the board was a you know was a map of the solar system and the missions would be you know go to the planet that has this or go to you know the the world that has this um and one of the fascinating things that we got to see as we played that game growing up was that at the same time uh the Voyager spacecraft were moving out through the solar system and uh so we got to we learned you know the answers to the questions so that we could do our missions in the game and then we learned what what was updated as Voyager discovered that Jupiter had more than 12 moons and things like that and so it was is not only uh you know not only a fun game that we played all the time but it was also just so exciting to see how much we still had to learn about the the solar system and how to get to watch that and and uh and see it happening in real time um so that was that's what you know kind of you know um and it grabbed me into uh into that uh this uh this field I love that so much um and honestly I I almost steer clear of ever mentioning how many moons Saturn and Jupiter have anymore because we keep finding new ones um and also I was just speaking to some school students in California the other day and I mentioned how like they have Star Wars Legos now and when I was a kid I had to use a model rocket engine igniter and melt the Lego plastic myself to make my Star Wars Legos are there things that the kids these days have um to learn about planetary science that kind of makes you maybe a little jealous or maybe inspired to know that they have a brighter future here um I'm certainly jealous of all the Legos in fact I still I still uh build Lego models uh I did that a lot as a kid as well and uh uh all the the different kinds of of blocks you have these days compared to a few decades ago is uh um there's there's certainly a lot a lot more there that's uh that's really fun to play with which uh which I enjoy um I I mean we know a lot more um you know there's just so much we've discovered about our own solar system and solar systems now Beyond ours uh in the last few decades but a lot of times what that tells us is how much more we have to learn um and so they're you know they're just more Stepping Stones now I think uh especially as we learn about more and more extra solar solar systems which is just uh thrilling yeah absolutely I mean over 5 000 EXO planets now are are known to exist it's mind boggling and that's a good transition to talk a bit about planetary science when in your career so you went to MIT and then went on for a PhD in planetary science but when did you realize that you know you really wanted to pursue a career in research and planetary science uh so when I um when I started uh at uh in college um I I knew I was interested in astronomy um I chose to major in physics because it was broad because I knew with a Physics degree I could go in a number of different directions and in fact initially I took a bunch of astrophysics courses which is fascinating right cosmology is is spectacular and mind bending but as uh as I took more uh courses uh going through my undergraduate degree I I started taking more planetary classes planetary science classes um and uh the accessibility of the solar system was kind of what brought me back into the solar system from uh you know from the broad or astronom the broader field of astronomy in particular um the uh uh kind of again still watching the voyagers go out through the the solar system uh was uh was very inspirational and so that's uh that's um kind of what what uh prompted me to to continue study in planetary science specifically um but again I actually uh I I went to a graduate program that was very broad uh because um I wasn't sure which area of planetary science it's such a broad you know a broad field it's basically all of the fields that we have here on Earth but then applied to you know the solar system together so um uh so I went to a broad program so that I would have you know still some some uh opportunity to explore different areas uh and see see what I wanted to uh to study as you know moving forward in my career that's fantastic yeah I think for our audience you know who are interested in astrobiology they likely know that you know in the Realms of planetary science and astrobiology geobiology these kind of larger diverse Realms of study they really do include so many different Pursuits from different Sciences different Realms of engineering um now in your career like I mentioned earlier you've been involved with Galileo and Cassini lro and now the upcoming Europa Clipper what was the pathway for you to get involved in Mission science and then to kind of take on leadership roles in Mission science as well uh as a graduate student um for my dissertation I was studying impact cratering the the impact cratering process and I was using uh numerical models to simulate uh impact creators on the formation of impact craters on other planets to understand uh what we can learn about the planet itself what the the final morphology of an impact grader can tell us about the uh about the the planet itself and another graduate student a colleague of mine at the University of Arizona Cynthia Phillips and I were she was working with the Galileo Mission and she was studying images of the surface of Europa and Europa of course is a fascinating Target from a perspective of impact cratering because the ice shell on Europa may be relatively thin and so we started collaborating on uh um you know on modeling cratering into uh um into ice shells uh you know and uh using the data that Galileo was sending back at the time and another colleague Betty piratso and I uh model different aspects of the impact cratering so the you know so there was a uh kind of a project there and then that kind of started that connection to the you know the mission that was sending the data back and uh after I finished my graduate degree I did a postdoctoral at a postdoctoral position supporting the um Galileo program but planning the observations for Io which is a another totally fascinating Moon we could talk about but um but that was the first mission role I had um was uh planning the Imaging observations with Galileo of uh of the Moon IO um and uh from that uh the next step in my career was um after the end of the Galileo Mission I started working with the Cassini Mission um again using working with the the Imaging Team Planning the observations of Titan and so that was my first uh you know my first connection to uh to Titan uh and exploring that um which was uh spectacular right we went from and it's we did this so quickly right you know just two decades ago we didn't know what was on the surface of Titan we were you know uh just getting ready for Cassini to arrive in 2004 and we had this uh incredible Whirlwind of going from knowing very little about the nature of the geography and the geology of Titan to mapping it and understanding how Titan works as a system in just several years so that was uh that was spectacular um uh to to get to participate in um and of course an exceedingly valuable experience uh in terms of uh um future you know planning future future missions oh that's fantastic a great time just to drop in a quick Poll for our audience as well on YouTube since he just mentioned um Cassini arriving uh in the saturnian system we had of course the Huygens Lander uh which went down through the atmosphere of Titan and it really was an atmospheric probe not really intended to be a Lander but it did land and we have an image from it um and it did a lot of research and so we have a question for our audience with dragonfly we're looking at spending at least two years if not more uh on Titan and so our question for the audience is how long did the Huygens probe survive on the surface of Titan and we have a few answers popping up right now in the chat uh one year six months two weeks four hours uh tell us what you think and I'll come back to that in a little bit of course you know in talking about the Huygens probe and Cassini and talking about dragonfly we did have Melissa trainer on the show back in 2020 in November of 2024 our 37th episode um and so much has changed since then bringing us up now to have Dr turtle on to talk about where dragonfly is now um so it's so cool to hear this kind of this connection of Galileo and Cassini of course you worked on lro and Europa Clipper now as well which is also another incredible Mission coming up very soon but I think for for time sake and for our audience I know they want to hear about dragonfly I wonder if you can speak to us now a little bit about the mission of dragonfly uh what we will be observing with dragonfly and how much how much knowledge it could bring to us oh absolutely um so after the Cassini mission right we spent 13 years in the saturnian system you know with a 126 flybys of Titan uh we know a lot about Titan but we one of the big outstanding questions is what the solid surface materials are are made of um and when NASA added Titan to uh the New Frontiers Mission Target list uh in 2016. um as as a you know an ocean worlds Target uh in the New Frontiers program uh we you know started brainstorming about how you know how we could uh best find answers to the question of what these materials are um and the reason this is important is that Titan um is a very special Target uh from an astrobiological perspective uh Titan's atmosphere which is unique among moons in the in the solar system in fact its atmosphere is denser than Earth's atmosphere um the second most common constituent in the atmosphere after nitrogen at Titan is car is methane and the methane breaks down at the top of the atmosphere uh and the more the and the molecules recombine to form very very complex carbon Rich molecules these are what form the haze and Titans atmosphere but they ultimately fall out onto the surface and Titan being an icy satellite when that surface melts at the site of an impact crater say or if there is cryovolcanism on the surface now you have all of the ingredients we know to be necessary for life in terms of these there's abundant carbon rich material that's all over the surface liquid water at the surface in the past as well as in the present day in the Deep interior ocean in inside of Titan uh and energy and so what we want to do with with dragonfly is go to Titan surface and see and pick up the results basically of these chemistry experiments that Titan has been running for US these Prebiotic chemistry experiments if you put all of this together um you know for some period of Time how far does the chemistry uh the the chemistry progress the organic the organic synthesis and um because we know what Titan's surface is like we know there are a number of different places that we'd like to go to make these measurements of the different in different geologic environments environments with different geologic histories uh and the atmosphere again uh gives us this opportunity uh to travel on Titan by flying instead of driving and so dragonfly came out of this thought process uh and is uh an octocopter uh a rotor craft Lander um that is designed to like the Rovers on Mars take everything with us from place to place uh and to make measurements of the chemistry uh and the uh and observe aspects of the Titan environment uh in a variety of of places on the surface and it's so awesome um just looking at the pictures of dragonfly it looks like it's going to be a very cool spacecraft it must be so cool to be involved in that process too of development and design I've read that it's going to land somewhere in the Shangri La Dune fields and um the primary Mission phase is maybe 100 miles worth of of flight maybe 20 different Landing sites um was there how much went into landing site selection um are we sure of even the pathway that we're going to follow yet or will that kind of like come you know as we're exploring know the the targeted landing area yeah um so the Titan uh environment is surprisingly Earth like in terms of its geology uh right it's an an icy satellite in the outer solar system with a surface temperature of 94 Kelvin uh and yet the features we see on the surface are very familiar and Titan's equatorial region is covered in the spectacular organic sand dunes we don't know how you form organic sand but Titan does uh and it's there waiting for us um and so we want to land in the in and among the sand dunes for a couple of reasons one is that the sand is organic in composition um uh and uh and it's very widely sourced and so this will give us uh information about materials across the surface of of Titan kind of like the Mars Pathfinder Landing site was chosen to be a place where a lot of different materials came together in a you know at the the base of a outflow uh Channel um to uh you know so you had opportunities to to make measurements and materials that came from much further away than you can travel the other reason the dunes are great is that this is these are very specific kind of Dune these longitudinal dudes uh and so uh they have very broad flat inter dune areas between them uh compositionally these are these areas have water ice as a component and so they will be able to tell us about the kind of primordial crust of Titan um in terms of its composition but they're also big broad flat areas and so that's perfect for initial Landing sites and so that's why we're Landing in the in the sand dunes because we've characterized these areas well with Cassini and we can design a Lander to land in these uh in these areas site is close to close to Silk impact crater which is an 80 kilometer diameter impact crater runes and inner dunes and then into the deposits associated with the impact crater itself will be able to make measurements of the composition of the chemistry in these environments where impact liquid water and uh and complex carbon molecules will have had the opportunity to mix well that's very cool and also so there there is some potential that there is an ocean under Titan's surface based on Cassini measurements do you think that that impactor might have even interacted with the subsurface ocean and potentially done some mixing as well from that material is that possible um so the The Ice crust on Titan is very thick uh probably at least 100 kilometers thick if not if not thicker so this impact crater may not have you know been able to affect the the entire that entire ice shell um although there is always fracturing beneath you know beneath impact cratering uh and we don't know the you know the um structure of you know of ice shells in you know in general in detail on on these uh these satellites um so we don't necessarily expect that this crater will would have had a direct connection to the the Deep interior ocean but one of the things we want to understand is what the opportunities are for exchange through the through the ice shell so in addition to taking uh images to understand the you know the details of the geology and what that can tell us uh whether we see evidence of fractures for example at the at the surface one of the the other things uh dragonfly will carry is a seismometer and this will allow us to listen for Titan Quakes uh to understand how seismically active uh you know this icy ocean world is and that will help us uh you know constrain the the possibility for for exchange between the Surface and the Deep interior liquid water ocean you know it's fantastic I do want to come back for our audience real quick too that poll we asked earlier for how long Huygens survived on the surface we offered you options of one year six months two weeks or four hours and roughly sixty percent almost 60 percent of the respondents got that correct around four hours um that's including going down through the atmosphere and then the actual arrival at the surface there was a lot we didn't know with Legends when I got there um you know did we think there was any potential of Huygens just sinking into one of those ethane Lakes um or just sinking into the surface because we really didn't know what the organic surface would be like at that point right we didn't we didn't know what the surface was going to be like and there were uh we did know that uh there was likely to be liquid in the system in fact Titan has a methane cycle like our water cycle right it's rainy here today right Titan has methane clouds and rain and lakes and rivers and seas um and we didn't know how much of the surface would be covered in liquid and how and where that liquid might be um so so Huygens the probe was actually this is this is spectacular Huygens was designed to be able to make measurements of a solid surface if it landed on a solid surface and to be able to float if it landed in uh in a liquid on the surface of Titan and make measurements of that liquid which is a a great feat of of engineering to be able to design a probe to land in two such different environments and make measurements and of course it landed on a solid surface uh and uh and sent us back into uh images as well as data about that surface absolutely and there's that one famous image I think that I've shared in so many of my own talks when speaking about Titan itself where we see just like this this surface with the haze above and then these Boulders of ice covered in organic goop um it's so incredible I'm so excited for dragonfly and also we just today before our show we can now talk about this dragonfly just passed a very momentous period in Mission design development and planning uh called the the preliminary design review I wonder if you could just speak to that process especially for those who maybe are more science focused and don't really understand how Mission development and the engineering side of things goes yeah uh so dragonfly was selected uh in 2019 um that that was a selection uh by NASA to be the next mission in the New Frontiers program and at that point we started our uh preliminary design phase uh so um there's a series of phases one goes through in terms of the mission uh development uh and so this this phase we spend more time looking at uh the aspects of the design really refining that design doing some of our testing of some of the hardware that's going to need to survive in the Titan environment for example and so it's been a very busy uh period of time and that culminates in a series of reviews uh of uh preliminary design reviews of our subsystems and our instruments and we had all of those last year there were uh more than 20 individual reviews uh through last summer and fall uh and then we had a full up Mission review this is a week long review with an independent standing review board who come here to APL and we spend a week talking about all things dragonfly and presenting the the current design getting feedback from them uh that then we carry forward as we move into the next phase and so uh so that's what we're uh that's that that's the Milestone of that preliminary design review or PDR and the team did a spectacular job uh and uh and everyone's really uh um you know the review board was very uh uh gave us great feedback uh and uh we passed our preliminary design review and are now looking ahead toward uh toward the next steps uh fantastic um I do briefly want to mention another poll that we had online on Twitter through at Nasa astrobio which is the NASA astrobiology programs Twitter account we asked everyone who was tuning in um during dragonfly's primary mission of roughly two years exploring the surface in clouds of Titan what aspects of the Moon most excited them or we could learn about um and over half of respondents said surface sampling but a large number also said aerial imagery and Atmospheric measurements and we had a much smaller number who are interested in seismic studies that's kind of sad for me you know since I also love geophysics and geochemistry and understanding the interior of a word I think is super important but it was very interesting to see that from our audience as well so thank you for everyone out there who voted in that poll and who again Tunes in for our show um Dr Turtle I do want to just change now just a little bit I I do want to jump to our audience questions as soon as I can so I do want to hear a little bit from you if you wouldn't mind for our audience speaking to the value of mentorship in your own career as well as this process of now kind of becoming a leader of such a large team developing a mission that is taking it'll take time to develop and launch and land and then do the science I mean these are our long term you know parts of your career and that you're now leading so I wonder if you could speak to especially our younger audience members who might want to follow in a similar pathway yes um and and especially uh in terms of outer planet exploration right this is a very these are long term processes uh long term projects and they give us uh the opportunity and I feel the responsibility to really um work with you know work with generations of uh you know of scientists and and Engineers as we go through the process and one of the things with dragonfly uh that we're able to do is Bridge the um you know Bridge from the the generation of scientists that uh designed and built and operated the Cassini and huygen's Mission uh to you know to the current uh generation and then forward uh to the Next Generation uh dragonfly is scheduled to arrive at Titan by 2034. um and so uh we will you know be working with uh students um and early career scientists along the way and that's something that we have built into our uh into our program uh to be able to um uh provide mentorship to provide experience to broaden participation in missions uh and find ways to give people opportunities to learn about missions even now in the mission development phase we're not getting data from Titan but there's so much to learn about how uh you know what's needed to put the you know to to design and and uh eventually you know integrate and test to the the hardware before we you know before we launch dragonfly to Titan and what we want to be able to do is bring people in at each each step of the way uh to give experience to the next generation of uh planetary Explorers I love that and so those watching right now maybe in the future you'll be part of the dragonfly Mission uh we've had past viewers of previous episodes reach out and find possible PhD mentors and guides and advisors along the way in their own careers through our show um so keep an eye out um another place Dr Turtle where you kind of been in this role of team work and and being part of a team um is in your own kind of Realm of of rowing of doing crew rowing and uh we always love hearing the human stories about the scientists who join us and so I'd love to hear about your rowing experience and how it's been part of your life as well as you're also a Tycho drummer um so I'd love to hear about these things and how they help make you kind of round out your life absolutely yeah I was uh I was fortunate enough to be able to learn Taiko when I was a uh when I was in Arizona in Tucson Arizona with a with a group there would I go Sonora um and it was a lot of you know a lot of fun uh and a very different dimension right to uh you know getting to getting to play drums uh to perform it was just such a different dimension from um uh you know from doing computer modeling during the day uh and it's always nice to have these you know these other kinds of outlets uh and when I moved uh I actually rode for a little bit in college uh and uh when I moved back from Arizona um there's not a lot of rowing in Tucson Arizona um uh given the climate there but moving back here to the east coast I was uh um I joined the um the Rowing Club up in uh everyone Club up in Baltimore uh and I've been uh rowing together uh with a team there and competing uh for um well for for quite a while now uh and it's uh it's really um it's really excellent to um again to kind of balance things you know to kind of balance things out right to you know if I'm out in the the boat you can't really be thinking about work or something's going to go wrong about um and so it's uh it's been a great balance in that sense and also in terms of the teamwork I love working uh together with teams um and uh so you know rowing in a you know in a boat together with a team where you're all all have to be in sync and you know uh everyone uh kind of playing their own role right and that's the same thing we do on you know on planetary missions these are very large and very broad teams with wide arrays of uh of expertise um and uh and I I really love that in uh whether it's for for play or or for work that's awesome um and it's always fun to hear but there's things that we all have in our lives that kind of bring us down to earth and give us a chance to be part of teams you know and whatever that looks like and have these other interests you know all of us who studied science and pursued careers in science and engineering have things that make us very human um I do really want to get to our audience questions I see a lot of them flowing in already from our YouTube audience and from Twitter um before that though we have our faster than light segment some fun rapid fire questions just to hear a bit more about your interest in astrobiology but as well as other things that have interested you in your career um so first off what is your favorite answer to fermi's question where are they so I um I think it's a an intriguing question um you know from the perspective of of trying to understand our place in the you know in the universe and where we fit in I think that it's that there are a lot of aspects I think it's telling us there are a lot of things we don't know yet um and so a lot of the a lot of the answers get at you know what what aspects of the the universe of the development of Life Etc don't we know and I I think uh I think it really helps to helps us to kind of uh compile that uh you know a set of things we we still need to learn about uh and and use as a as a guide to uh uh to look for answers to some of those unknown factors wonderful um what stories be they novels and television shows whatever what stories have inspired you to want to learn more about the universe uh most of the stories I think that have really have really deep really inspired me or the or the um uh are the the real ones of our of our you know exploration of space so so far um in terms of watching as you know getting to watch as we you know saw the voyagers go further and further out through the the solar system and discover things uh that were new um I took a class as an undergraduate about what we were going to learn at the Neptune uh flyby by Voyage or based on what we knew so far and when we had the Neptune fly by six months later so many of the things we thought we were going to learn we learned very different things and so that uh those constant surprises and the fact that the solar system and the you know beyond uh has a better imagination than we sometimes do uh is one of the things that uh that really you know inspires me to to keep looking outward and and looking beyond the next Horizon wow fantastic yeah there's so much Serendipity in some of our exploration you know from from you know plumes out of Enceladus the surface of Titan you know all these discoveries and things you know we always think we're gonna find it one way and then it's completely different um there's so much for us to learn um so another question if you could go back in time and visit yourself at the very beginning of your career what advice would you give yourself it's okay if it's not easy right it's often we look at at people in careers uh and and think that um because they are you know because of where they are that it must have been easy for them to get there um and and uh it's not it's not always easy and that's okay if something takes multiple times to get it it's you know can be really worth putting the effort in to keep trying to get there um but just because something doesn't come easily the first time you try it doesn't mean you can't do it uh and and it doesn't mean that by persevering and pushing through that you won't be able to do it even better um as you uh as you move ahead so I think that would be the the biggest thing um that uh it's not things don't always come easy and that's that's okay uh it's it's okay to keep trying when they don't that's wonderful um what is something that excites you I mean Beyond dragonfly about the future I'm really excited about a lot of the the upcoming exploration we're doing uh and the next generation of explorers and uh what people are going to think about uh I think about next we have been we are so fortunate in our solar system um in terms of the variety of uh of destinations and the complementarity of the destinations right uh the different things that we will be able to learn at uh at Europa and Titan and Enceladus and the Iranian satellites right each of these give us a different story a different history and a picture into the realm of possible uh scenarios for uh you know for for planetary histories for the histories of Worlds and I just can't wait to to learn about all of them frankly I love that one more question from me what's an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind um the the discovery Creations in so many of the icy satellites in the outer solar system is is fascinating the fact that there can be these oceans and not just in one but in many worlds uh is uh that I I still just find that uh just find that incredible and I I can't wait till we get to explore them absolutely um thank you so much for that we are going to open it now to our audience questions so for those watching right now live in the YouTube chat please ask your questions if you are watching the recording later of course we can't answer those questions now but um I will try my best to get to them in the comments later um so let's go uh first off with a question from Jim pass who is at astrosociology on Twitter uh Jim wants to know how the dragonfly mission to Titan is going to compare to the Ingenuity Mission uh which we of course have now seen you know flying as a small drone on the surface of Mars yeah Ingenuity has been spectacular uh it's really it's so exciting to see you know to see flight on another on another world in our solar system um so uh there are a number of ways in in in which uh exploration at Titan is different uh from the the uh Exploration with Ingenuity at uh at Mars uh one is the scale um The Martian atmosphere is very is very thin uh and Mars has higher gravity is a little larger than Titan so at Titan we have an atmosphere that's four times as dense as Earth's atmosphere and that has one seventh and Titan has one seventh of gravity of uh of Earth so it's actually physically easier to fly on Titan like a person could put Wings on and soar over the over the surface which would be a really excellent future mission to Titan um so on Titan the dragonfly octocopter is about the size of the perseverance Rover as opposed to the the you know Ingenuity which which is you know has to be much smaller simply because of the Dynamics of flight in the in the Martian atmosphere on Titan we can actually take something the size of perseverance and fly from place to place uh which allows us to take you know a very capable payload um the same way we've been exploring on Mars with uh with the Rovers um another uh difference is um that the um uh that we don't have a fleet of orbiters at Titan yet sadly um and so dragonfly has to do direct to Earth communication from the surface of Titan uh so all of the data will come directly from the surface of Titan as opposed to being relayed through you know satellites as we're able to do at Mars uh but uh uh one of the areas that's similar is that even though Mars is much closer and the light time is much shorter uh but Ingenuity has to fly completely autonomously on the surface of Mars and so we have that experience on Mars already and dragonfly will be also flying completely anonymously uh at Titan that's fantastic um and so you mentioned you know all these orbiters we have at Mars where we can you know send data links through orbiters back to Earth and so we have to communicate directly but we also have a lot more imaging um a question from at science unders underscore sponge on Twitter um is is there possibility of having cameras doing high high definition images of Titan like we have for Mars and I guess the question is you know what level what resolution will images be taken from dragonfly right so uh so we have a global mapping from uh from Cassini at very different wavelengths uh we have radar mapping at 2.2 centimeters down to you know near infrared Imaging uh on these uh the resolutions of those uh are at the 100 meter scale so we can use that Global mapping we know where we want to go we know aspects of the surface to be able to play in dragonfly but we don't have you know high rise in orbit at uh at Titan and so dragonfly will actually scout out it scout out its own sites in advance um and by virtue because we're able to fly we can actually use dragonfly to do our own scouting uh and so we'll fly out take images of the the surface uh come back to our Landing site and then uh you know play those images back to Earth uh to uh to decide where we where we want to go next and we use dragonfly to to do its own scouting uh we'll have images uh at resolutions ranging from you know from meter scale uh down down to very very high resolution imaging of our of our sampling of the sampling site uh where we where we do drilling to to break up the surface material to bring into the mass spectrometer and there will be Imaging at the scale of grains so that we can really understand the the details of the the surface at the the sampling site so we'll have this whole range of kind of nested uh Imaging um at different scales wonderful our next question from AC is about the surface temperature of Titan being just slightly warmer than liquid nitrogen would we expect the metabolism for Life as we know it and I think I'll start off there that you know dragonfly is not an astrobiology Mission directly it's not it's directly looking for signs of life because yes it is very cold on the surface of Titan as you've mentioned but as you mentioned as well like we're exploring this realm where there has been an impact crater and there could be different energetic systems what do you think is kind of the vision what could we discover with dragonfly in that Realm right so so as you say dragonfly is primarily a chemistry Mission we want to understand the chemical steps that occur before biology uh and how far how how far that chemistry can have progressed in this extraterrestrial environment in the outer solar system right we can't easily study the chemistry that occurred before life here on Earth because because we've got you know biology on top of it everywhere uh and so that's really what we're what we're looking for um we do because we're making uh detailed measurements of aspects of Titans uh you know composition and chemistry we do have the capability to uh to identify a variety of chemical biosignatures if chemistry on Titan in at some point in the past did take the the leap to biology 94 Kelvin certainly isn't conducive to uh to Life as we know it um but the Titan environment is very protected um there's an atmosphere that protects the surface from radiation for example and so if there are molecules that you know uh were created very long ago you know geologically speaking they they won't break down at the same kind of rate that we're used to on other on other targets and so we'll be able to to make those measurements um to understand uh you know we'll be able to to measure that uh that uh chemistry because it it's an environment that will preserve preserve those uh the chemical products uh but yeah fundamentally we're we're trying to understand the chemistry that occurred before before biology yeah and that chemistry is really important I recall when I was in graduate school I took an environmental organic chemistry course but the professor allowed me to do a project for the course focusing on Titan atmospheric chemistry that we knew of and at that point you know it was really you know we did have measurements from Huygens we had some knowledge from Cassini but a lot of it was basically modeling trying to figure out based on known photochemistry and you know the ethane methane precursors nitrogen precursors what is possible within the realm of energetics and and the chemistry available we have a question from upgrade me BB on YouTube um they want to know if we're using something like artificial intelligence um to generate models to kind of simulate potential uh chemicals we might find with dragonfly at the surface or the atmosphere uh we we are doing um work in terms of uh modeling uh the and in in fact generating literally producing uh the kinds of of molecules that we might find on the surface uh in the laboratory we want to have uh kind of a library to be able to compare the measurements that we that we make at Titan 2 so that we can interpret that um so yeah so we can do that through through modeling but there's also uh you know you can also generate a lot of these materials in small quantities in the laboratory and one of our team members uh Dr Sarah Hurst at Johns Hopkins University has uh you know has a laboratory where she can build the uh you know some of these uh carbon rich tollens that uh we expect to be on the surface of Titan so that'll be a fascinating comparison to see if what we build in the laboratory or what we model is what Titan is producing or if once again Titan surprises us completely and has gone off and and uh you know and and developed things in a in a in a different way than uh than we predict oh fantastic a question coming in from Valentin uh at Valu underscore 66 000 on Twitter um they want to know if dragonfly is going to actually study any of the Lakes at the surface of Titan Titan has these hydrocarbon Lakes at the surface and specifically Valentin says they would love to see photos of these Lakes up close that would be spectacular um so Titans uh sees and most of the lakes are near the North Pole are at very high Northern latitudes and the time scale for the for the new frontier for our for our mission in the New Frontiers program uh is such that we arrive in uh uh by 2034. uh this is about One Titan year after the arrival of the Huygens probe and so that's actually very fortuitous in that we actually have measurements of the atmosphere from Boykins um you know and we know what the weather was like in the Titan system from Cassini observations when uh when Cassini arrived at uh at Saturn Titan uh so that's excellent um but that time in Titan's year is Northern winter Titan has Seasons like ours the the saturnian system is tilted of a little more than than the uh tilt of the Earth Moon system uh and so the seasons it has Seasons just like ours except they're you know several years instead of a few months long uh and so when we arrive it will be late Northern winter and the northern latitudes will still be in Northern darkness that that means that not only is there not illumination for Imaging but because we are doing direct to Earth communication from the surface if uh you know if the the sun isn't up in the sky the Earth isn't up in the sky and so it wasn't uh you know it wasn't possible in this time frame uh to explore the the high Northern latitude simply because of the of the Season uh so we have chosen to go to uh uh you know a target of astrobiological Interest where uh liquid water and uh carbon material may have been able to mix at the site of a equatorial or near equatorial impact crater for this Mission um but unfortunately we won't be able to uh to get to the the lakes and seas this time although I agree it would be spectacular to get images of those shorelines well it's a little saddening but I imagine just like everything in our Planetary Exploration we'll discover all new things with dragonfly that will be remarkable and give us yet another reason to go back and explore some more we have a question coming in from rendering reality 3D animations on YouTube they want to know um if we can describe how dragonfly will study atmospheric differences with altitude um specifically in like boundary layers in the in the atmosphere changes over a diurnal cycle if there is one for us to explore during uh dragonfly's Mission um while we're looking for the chemistry of the surface and atmosphere of Titan yeah so we want to be able to put the measurements we make of the you know the detailed chemical composition of different materials on the surface of Titan into the context of the Titan environment to understand the environment itself uh and that the habitability how things vary from from location to location so we have you know the the Imaging we have the geophysical measurements and we have a suite of meteorological sensors to uh to measure aspects of the atmosphere uh you know pressure temperature uh wind speed wind direction Etc um and we will make we will be monitoring through the Titan day um uh the monitoring the conditions through the Titan day the Titan atmosphere actually doesn't change a lot with a dense atmosphere it's quite sluggish uh and so the the surface temperature is you know day to night uh you know winter to summer uh is it really only changes about by about a Kelvin but will certainly be certainly be be measuring that uh to understand the uh to understand the atmosphere and its variability we'll be able to do some measurements with with low altitude we don't need to fly terribly High uh in our mission operations plan to Traverse from place to place across the surface we'll probably only apply at an altitude of a few hundred meters but we uh we do have some measurements planned during the last stages of our initial descent through Titan's atmosphere and we may be able to fly to do atmospheric profiles to slightly higher altitude but not up to like the you know the tropopause or something like that just in the very lowest part of the atmosphere for this mission yeah very cool and Titan has a very thick atmosphere um we did mention earlier this idea of sampling from the surface while one of our users AC on YouTube wants to know if the RTG will be used for melting ice or or what kind of drilling process we're using on dragonfly to sample the surface yeah we uh have a rotary percussion of drill so this breaks up the surface and then we can actually use pneumatic transport because we've got this great atmosphere uh to just like a vacuum cleaner you just suck the the material right into the um into the mass spectrometer and the fact that the atmosphere is so cold allows us to keep those materials cold until we get them into the mass spectrometer to make measurements which is really which is very very important as well uh the mmrtg the multi mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator that we used for that we use for power we use that to charge a battery um there's a lot of what's typically referred to as waste heat that comes off of off of the mmrtg we use every bit of that to keep the interior of the Lander warm so the exterior of the Lander will be basically the temperature of of titano be equilibrated with uh with the Titan environment uh and we have a thick layer of insulation uh around the around the the Lander so that we keep all of that all of that heat inside uh to keep the uh to keep the you know the instruments functioning Etc so there won't be any heating of the environment by by dragonfly in that sense am I fantastic I I love these conversations so much because they always like bring things to my mind imagery of the you know this this you know rotorcraft Lander now the outside is like so freezing cold you know and it kind of just like brings this Vision to my mind of the outside metal being freezing cold but the inside having this loving heat from from us giving it the RTG to heat it up inside um and that kind of is a fun way to jump into this next question which I really appreciate from Tasha on YouTube Tasha wants to know uh what is something about Titan that you would love to see represented more or maybe represented better in our artists impressions of Titan different geological environments and just how how familiar they are sometimes you know sometimes when when uh we think of extraterrestrial worlds we think of you know very alien environments and I think one of the things that's that struck me about Titan is is in some senses just how how Earth like it is and how familiar it is I still I still remember uh the images that came back from the huygensburg the first time I saw one of those images uh from uh from The Descent images showing the channeled landscape on Titan and it was instantly so recognizable and so familiar and here we are on this icy satellite out in the outer solar system with all of these different materials and very different conditions and yet we're seeing something that you you don't you you immediately know what it is when you look at uh and so that that kind of balance of familiarity and uh you know in this uh In This Very on this very different world uh is is something that uh that always strikes me and I'd like be happy to see that uh that kind of balance struck um and a number of artists do a good job of that wonderful well maybe we have some artists watching right now who want to take on that task and and create some cool Impressions and visuals and graphics for us to see um one thing we've not really discussed is how Titan became such a methane and ethane rich world what we know uh user arunov upadar um who is one of our past young scientist program participants at Blue Marble space Institute of science arunova wants to know how dragonfly might help us understanding the origin and history of the methane and ethane and chemical inventory of Titan right so one of the things we want to do is understand uh what the role of the equatorial regions are in the broader you know hydrological cycle on on Titan um there are a lot of outstanding questions about Titan's hydrology given the the Dune the nature of the Dune fields at Titan's equator it seems like in general it must be an arid place um on the other hand Cassini did observe some rainfall at some Seasons uh at low latitudes and so understanding that uh that hydrology whether there are near surface uh um reservoirs of of liquid is going to be is going to be very important to understand um the the Huygens probe uh potentially detected you know that the surface the surface there may have been damp and so uh so that kind of measurement the measurements it'll allow us to get at just the very it's very shallow surface uh but that kind of that kind of measurement is going to be important uh we also uh have the mass spectrometer also uh has the capability to measure um uh um noble gases uh some of the noble gases and that on the you know kind of stepping back to the big picture will help us understand uh the nature of the the atmosphere and provide some uh information about the uh the atmospheric history which of course they're you know they're still outstanding very fundamental questions about about Titan's unique atmosphere absolutely and it is a very thick and dense atmosphere it's one and a half times the pressure at the surface and we have here at sea level and it's a very thick atmosphere I love pointing out for students that like the International Space Station where it's orbiting the Earth would very much still be in that very thick hazy layer um our user miles fully on YouTube wanted to know if we could see a Saturn rise photo from dragonfly looking up but again it's a it's a very thick atmosphere and so maybe not I'll let you answer that question but what do you think we'll see if we look up with dragonfly uh right so they're um so Titans atmosphere is thick we are Imaging with dragonfly is that um is that uh visible wavelengths mostly visible just just into the near infrared uh the visibility of the atmosphere in terms of of the you know the methane transmission spectrum is much better out into the infrared uh but because we're down within the atmosphere at the you know the base of the atmosphere uh you know we can see fine too to explore the surface um looking up what we would see is the you know is the kind of orange the orange Sky uh so we wouldn't be able to see Saturn in the sky for a couple reasons one is because of the uh the opacity of the the atmosphere um you know when you're looking through the full Optical depth of the atmosphere but the other is that Titan is tidally locked to uh to Saturn uh so the same just like our moon the same side of Titan always faces Saturn and we're landing on the opposite side from where Saturn is so even if we were able to observe at a wavelength where you could see Saturn uh it's it won't be up in the up in the sky above above dragonfly so we'll have to we'll have to look for a future opportunity for that uh that picture which would be spectacular it would be pretty spectacular again another reason we'll have to eventually go back again and do even more work um and that now in my mind I can't help but like visualize the titanium atmospheres like this orange Haze above this beautiful Frozen on the outside uh dragonfly if it chooses to look up um you know again that's part of the fun of these conversations it's just to think of what's going to happen what's likely what we would see ourselves and and maybe even to personify uh dragonfly a little bit I we did note our team um that in the current iteration of the design that we're at now that it does look a little bit cuter it's like a little button nose on the front of it uh can you explain what that change was oh there have been a number of of changes in the in the design as we've gone you know gone through our our design iteration uh in the preliminary design phase coming up to our our review uh just the uh the end of last month um a lot of this has been um a lot of the design changes have been focused on uh we want to make sure that we're as aerodynamic as possible it's not you know the most aerodynamic shape but it's definitely more aerodynamic than it was to be able to really uh you know buy uh simplify flight enable our our flight or better enable our flight uh we're also reducing you know keeping our mass as low as possible um so a lot of the the work we've done is to uh is to simplify aspects of the design to um reduce risk as much as possible as we can through design and and some of those things are showing up in the in the new design in terms of uh the streamlining uh and the simplification of the exterior as well I love that so much we do have more questions unfortunately for our audience and for me um we're running out of time to have you on the show with us here uh for the audience there is a remarkable website for dragonfly you can check out lots of really incredible Mission information
