what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind the closest extrasolar planet is a little over four light years away so there's two aspects of that one is the clo our closest neighbor has a planet right there's planets all over the place this that blows my mind and then if you do the numbers a 100 billion stars in a galaxy 100 billion galaxies in the universe half of them have planets this is an unbelievable number of potential for life but the other is our nearest neighbor is four light years away it boggles the mind how far that is and so any chance of us going from the remote sensing stage to actually getting there we're going to need a mission that we're willing to wait centuries for the for the data to get back
