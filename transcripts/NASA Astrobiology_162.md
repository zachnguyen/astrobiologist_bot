[Music] hello everyone my name is jono Abshire I am a second year PhD student at Portland State University working in the center for life in extreme environments more specifically out of the extreme virus lab and today I'll be giving you a little bit of insight into Life In Hell understanding the role of toxin antitoxin systems in prokaryotic genomes and their potential for virus host co evolution tldr extreme organisms the viruses that infect them and their interactions in these extreme environments and our journey kind of begins right here so this is a personal image of Lassen Volcanic National Park it is one of the many areas on our beautiful planet that is home to these volcanic Hot Springs this is one of the main sampling sites of our lab and while most people wouldn't believe that there are things living in this environment there certainly are um specifically these microbes from hell and I'll get back to these guys in just a second but a little bit of background about why we why we study these particular environments so these volcanic Hot Springs are often considered and understood to be analogues for both for planets both outside and inside of our solar system referring back to some of the ancient Hot Springs found recently on Mars which may or may not have looked something like this boiling Mud Pot that we find in Devil's Kitchen at Lassen Volcanic National Park getting back to the microbes one such microbe is this um micro right here uh spherical cell known as sacrolobus so factoricus this is a scanning electron microscope showing you the topology of the cells um coined s441 by our lab really thrives and uh lives in these hot acidic conditions with temperatures from around 70 to 75 to 80 degrees C and ph's of around 3 to as low as one so these really extreme environments and when we think about these environments and the reach ecosystems that uh and habitat them we can also think about one of the most abundant molecules on the planet so that of viruses and yes there are these extreme viruses infecting these extremophiles uh the one which I work with in lab is sopholobus spindle shape virus one sacrilebus is a natural host of this particular virus this ssv1 this is Stanley uses they them pronouns a really character by his lemon shape so these shapes are really unique to both archaeal organisms extremophiles and some of these extreme viruses and when we think about looking at these organisms and the interactions between them in these extreme environments we can look at some systems currently prevalent today in bacterial cells so these toxin antitoxin systems usually known as addiction modules found on plasmids again really prevalent in bacterial genomes only recently being uh being discovered to have some viral encoding and what this particular system confers is when you have a plasmid that has the positive uh or is positive for that particular addiction module that cell will needs that plasmid in order to continue its life in that particular environment so here we have the presence of the TA should that cell or progeny continue with the presence of that plasmid you would expect normal growth in the environment whereas if it were to lose that plasmid it would would have been addicted to that particular genome it would die off whereas in a negative system you would get growth either way whether or not there's plasmid loss and we can further visualize this particular mechanism by looking at what might happen to some uncolonized cells some sort of event happens in which the addiction module is introduced to that population and you have your addicted Survivor going on to make new progeny and then conferring that group protection and persistence so these systems are really understood in bacteria to confer a microbial persistence phenotype some have been referred to as fate defense mechanisms and largely considered uh as plasmid stabilizers on the plasm um and we can also uh assume that another group of uncolonized cells were to come in here perhaps that group encounter you would still get that toxic culling uh from that toxin antitoxin system uh one important note they are characterized as two genes that are typically right next to each other um the toxin being just Downstream of the antitoxin uh pretty stable toxin pretty unstable antitoxin and looking at this system with ssv1 a previous student did quite a bit of work in uh mutagenesis of the ssv1 genome and we use this at least these mutants to test whether or not some of these uh genes or open reading frames are essential to the virus and two genes in particular this T3 and TX transcript these particular two genes we can make changes to what I think is the antitoxin and we don't see too much um difference in terms of viral infection viral function whereas if we were to delete this uh or insert a sequence into this particular open reading frame what I think is the toxin we do see differences in infection mechanisms and looking at infection mechanisms of these extreme viruses and just virus reproduction overall viruses can typically go through two Pathways or a combination of both so a lyric cycle in which the viral genome or the viral DNA will insert itself into the cell you have some replication going on eventually assembly of those virions and the cell will then burst die and those viruses will go on to infect other cells whereas in a lysogenic cycle the viral genome is incorporated into the host genome and there's usually a latent phase in which it kind of just stays there maybe some induction event happens in ssv's case it actually just buds from the cell without killing the cell and one of the one of the two ways that we use to test for this viral reproduction is of course PCR so amplifying a sequence that's specific to viral DNA looking for its presence in cell free supernatants another way is through Halo assay so very similar to a plaque assay in which you look where cells are bursting we cultivate a lot of cells uninfected sacraloba cells like you saw in the slide a while back and then we spot cell free supernatants which contain these mutant viruses onto the plate and look for clearings and this Halo assay is made possible because of the fact that ssv1 buds from its cell without killing the cell um and the onion the infected cells grow quite slower so it really converts this growth stunting phenotype in the sacrolobus cell and looking at the toxin protein and large a large majority of my work has been looking at mutants that we've made in this toxin protein and several uh machine learning softwares have indicated that there's a quite a high probability of a cleavage site over here behind this very hydrophobic uh Helix you right here and so I sought to characterize at least this particular mechanism in ssv1 through using some of these mutants that we already have um and while largely these over here are our wild type so really shouldn't expect any kind of change in viral function you can see some really nice Halos and we can confer that you know the cells are not dying but they're sick and in our mutants where we have insertions in in that specific toxin uh open reading frame we don't see any Halo formation um likewise I sought to substitute those two uh residues at the cleavage site since it's largely important for protein maturation protein function and we still don't see a Halo just switching those two residues but the main takeaway from this is that we still get virus replication um we still get quite a bit of at least high levels of viral replication from some of these mutants and one of these mutants particular we didn't see anything so maybe that one's detrimental to that particular open reading frame but we do see that there is virus replication happening in the cell supernatant when we screen for DNA um and it's important to kind of note that this this protein isn't just unique to ssv1 um in in looking at these systems in these extreme organisms uh this one in particular up here is another SSV so another spindle shaped virus in which we see really low sequence similarity across these particular genes but quite a hot quite a high bit of um structural similarity between these genes and a lot of these are genomes of extremophiles while some are virally encoded and uh one of the main takeaways really just wrapping uh wrapping it all back around looking for these particular mechanisms and how they confer persistence with both their extremophilic organism and their viruses would be a really nice first start in looking for these biosignatures perhaps um and ways that we can look into how the microbes might be interacting in these particular extreme environments this is another sampling video um just of Lassen Volcanic Park pretty pretty close to where s441 was isolated from uh looks pretty similar to maybe something we'd see on another planet that we could sample at and then a Shameless plug but looking for viruses in space I think is the obvious next step we know that they're the most abundant molecule on the planet and just understanding that these mechanisms and that these systems are out there allowing these cells to thrive in this particular environment would be a great uh in starter conversation for looking for these small biomolecules in space and with that I just want to thank my lab um my group over here at Boiling Springs Lake when we collected samples and my Pi uh Dr Ken Stedman thank you [Music] thank you General we have a time for about three questions hey my name is Pia and I'm really interested in like Christopher Cross Community of microbes um have you looked at all into the interactions of other phage defense systems um yeah so at least in terms of uh this toxin antitoxin system they're pretty understood in bacterial cells to like incorporate themselves into the genomic crispr cas9 there are some proteins that um that look pretty similar to this a291 and some of these other virally encoded genes that do have some kind of crispr casts editing mechanism so yeah I think they it might be leaning towards that way but they're pretty well characterized in terms of like how they work with proteins and mRNA so um yeah not too far there yet but um definitely definitely somewhere in there uh thank you for the talk um Marshall Seton JPL and I I was curious so um you're talking about looking for viruses and extraterrestrial environments um do you think there would be or I'm curious I'm completely ignoring yeah so no no I dropped out of biotube so for this um for viruses specifically like it would small molecule biosignature classes vary from viruses to like what you'd be looking for to cells yeah yeah I I for sure and that kind of brings me at least back to a point like of looking for fossils and stuff like that so viruses and sediment um and at least our lab there's been some work in like silica and coding viruses and how you know the stability of them so maybe there's a pretty silica Rich environment in which we might be able to look for any kind of these signatures so like proteins um or or yeah just specific things that might might have been preserved in those particular environments um considering that these viruses live and thrive in in pretty extremes um you know they're they're they got they got to be out there at least in my mind so you mentioned um looking at like morphology and fossils and things like that I know that at least for um looking at cells and things they've been shown to to mimic abiotic systems uh pretty well because humans are very good pattern recognition and so um has anything been seen like that for viruses yeah not the not that I'm familiar with um I know it's at least a brand new conversation of starting to look for like viruses in space Astro virology things like that so uh yeah we're just kind of getting up and running oh yeah yeah no sorry I don't mean to like play 20 Questions oh no I just thought it was cool you're totally fine thank you yeah there's a there's a little cure lab that like goes on right now that I teach so I'm obviously not there but they're in spirit any other questions [Music] thank you
