[Music] hi everyone I'm from Ohio University I'm a space biologist a bit different from astrobiologists in that we send plant samples to space and I will try to see how those plant samples adapt to the space flight environment and then we use information from these to make them better adapt to a stream environment on heart or to also prepare how we can cultivate uh plants in space for future cultivations future exploration and so I work on arabidopsis plants which is a model plant it's what E coli is to microbiologists and um it's model because it's a also the genome sequenced already and so we can easily trace a particular phenotype to a particular genotype so to the right up there is what the arabidosis siblings look like after we get them back from the space environment in this case I mean about about the International Space Station at the lower Hutt orbit where we have zero gravity microgravity and that way we have ionizing radiation and altered flue gas Dynamics as one of the extremities in that environment so basically we send seed to space we let those seeds germinate in space we let them grow for few days we freeze them and we return them to Earth and when they get part of half I analyze them transcriptomics and proteomics to make uh to make sense of how such plants adapts to the space flight environment and for uh us to conduct specified environments we use different Hardwares as you can see on top on top Air is the advanced plant habitat that's the desired most desirable Hardware currently for almost everyone researching uh space plant biology and here we have the brick break Hardware I love using the brick it's got the name from the fact that it looks like a brick Block it's biological research in canister I work with it and this is the European modular cultivation system it's been retired currently and being replaced by the multivariable platform so these are just a few of the many Hardwares that we used to send specimen to space plants micro but in this case we we use this to stand out plant to space uh the first multi homix are experiments conducted on plant Central space was conducted by my lab and then we discovered that uh comparing the look for change of the transcript that's the RNA to the look for change of the protein while plotting a correlation graph of it we discovered very low correlation between differentially expressed transcript and differentially abundant protein which is uh indicative of the fact that post transcriptional modification of transcript is one of the Adaptive mechanism of plants to space flight environment that means not all RNA gets to become protein and that also net it's it's underscore the need for us to study procurements to conduct proteomic studies of these plants that we send to space because the proteomies will probably give more insight into the Adaptive mechanism than the transcriptomics unfortunately because protonic study require large tissue Mass which we don't have the luxury of having large tissue large plants sent to space most people conduct just transcriptomic study until date globally only for protonic study have been conducted on arabidosis and above ISS and these are the four protonic studies uh different environments are different uh conditions different variables uh age of the plants out where uh light condition seed line used the tissue type and the type of protein extracted they vary across all those uh four experiments two of those experiments were conducted on the lab I'm the one in charge of the last one in red called The Brick LED uh project so to get idea of um what's uh the uh to get idea of plants response on the the protonic level to the space flight environment based on these are field data set we have to do what we call meta analysis of the protonic data set from this of the protonic data sets from these four experiment and that's what I do so this is the first stage of the metal analysis so we start from the left ear are we intersected the protein um abundance about the detected protein across all the four Hardwares and common to the protein across all the four Hardware these are three protein which are pick up one that's the microtubule destabilizing protein which is involved in chromosome separation during cell division it involves information of um cell shape and it's also involved in a transport vesicular transport implant and also we we discovered the comment of these four four data sets our protein is that the protein involving defense response and mRNA binding now I went a step further and isolated uh the data set called emcs which is the the data set called abrs Advanced biological research system I isolated it from the data from the general data set because it uh they use the mutant seed line so I I only call I compared those seed lines that were the wide type and from intersection of the three data set that com that you know that use our seed lines that are white type we have these eight proteins and here are the air the proteins so conducting the protein protein uh interaction network analysis we see that regulation of microtubule microtubule destabilization or microtubule rearrangement is a major adaptation uh mechanism of plants to the extreme space flight environment and one thing we notice in phenotype of plants that we grow in space is that they are usually uh smaller looking less healthy compared to those grown on Earth where we have the full gravity and there are no ionizing radiation now I went further to compare the brick data set which are the one that we conducted in our lab and we can be so sure of so we have two of them we have the brick LED which were conducted in light you know this brick LED Hardware add light in it and we have the brick PDF view which had no light so all these plants this experiment were both flown to space uh weapon were both flew into space but won't add light one add more light both of them had no gravity are they so at The Intercept of them the protein here 186 of them would definitely be due to the space flight environment while the protein here will be due to photomorphogenesis that is growed in light cross interacting protein maybe between the hardware and growth and light and Elusive protein due to the advanced technology that we use on the brick LED compared to the brick PDF view why the protein here are those involved in scotomorphogenesis growth in darkness and cross interacting protein now I call this protein due to space flight environment I call them the brick intercept so comparing the brick intercept this is the brick intercept comparing it with another data set from the European modular cultivation system where they add a centrifuge about the International Space Station one decentric food having the 1G centrifuge above International Space Station eliminates microgravity so it introduced 1G gravity so this data set emcs as as excluded microgravity and everything in this data set is radiation so comparing our intersecting this brick intercept with this emcs data set whatever is in the middle here will definitely be due to radiation or altered fluid gas Dynamic you know in the absence of gravity plants don't pick water the same way that we do on Earth and whatever we have here is due to microgravity definitely and whatever we have here proteins here are due to the emcs hardware and cross interaction now doing a protein protein interaction a network of the uh proteins that we believe are due to radiation we see that ah most of them are involved in ribosome assembly ribosome biogenesis and um ribosome powerogenesis and protein translational Machinery so one takeaway from this is that arabidosis ribosomal activity is altered by space flight ionizing radiation So currently I'm I'm comparing the transcriptomic data between these two data sets and we're also trying to do a wet lab determination of the specific role of this intersecting protein so we're hoping to collaboration on a protonic meta analysis of this uh space flight stuff there are a lot of things that could be done or made so uh my acknowledgment to Dr Sarah white that's my advisor and then Dr Colin Cruz from the National Lab in New Mexico and to the NASA analysis working group plant homies who sponsored this uh research thank you so much [Applause] oh [Music] thank you
