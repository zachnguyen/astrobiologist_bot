what stories have inspired you to want to pursue your career and learn more about life in the universe fundamentally I was struggling in fourth grade I didn't like to read I was bored I was a class clown in the back you know causing trouble and we had to buy a book from a book club so I brought in my 50 cents plopped it down and I was looking around you know you can imagine a little kid oh this is so boring and then I came across a title that said Mission to Mars that sounded like fun so I bought this book it was about a family going to Mars and they meet martians the Martians helped them to survive because their life support system wasn't working right it's really been fun now to work and it closes the circle I had a new spark in fourth grade to think about outer space and flying to other planets and that came from that one single book uh and now I'm working on Mars astrobiology I think that's a really cool Circle
