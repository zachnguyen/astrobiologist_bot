how has the question of life's Origins changed over time either like during your career or just in general how have you seen this question changing yeah that's a good question yeah so I guess I've been at it for a little while now I've been interested at the kind of historical change in scientific ideas it wasn't a question till a certain point right or a scientific question till maybe the middle of the 19th century and what people like Pastor were thinking about versus people like Miller versus people like the ones who are active in the field today there's some commonalities but there's some changes and some of them reflect I think changes in technology right but also Pastor couldn't think about an RNA World it just wasn't a thing whereas that's you know a leading theory today and then we see other new like camps like hydrothermal vent sort of models that are springing out of things that were discovered in the 1970s you know there'll probably be new ones tomorrow
