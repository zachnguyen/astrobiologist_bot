[Music] in this lecture we'll look in a little more detail at the radial velocity method for detecting exoplanets remember the radial velocity method is a measurement of the reflex motion of stars as a way of detecting exoplanets that cannot be seen directly the observed light is periodically red and then blue shifted recurring each orbit the data can be added together because the orbit repeats and so the data can be gathered red and then blue shift red and then blue shift over many orbits and that us allows us to push the precision of the technique and detect lower and lower mass planets this periodic doppler shift is measured by taking a spectrum of the star and taking a spectrum over a period of time over and over again and carefully comparing the spectra so it requires an instrumental method that establishes a very careful and precise and stable zero point for the spectroscopy wavelength to allow us to detect its variation by relatively small fractional amounts the magnitude of the doppler shift indicates the speed of the reflex motion or the radial velocity of the star we make a spectrum with a spectrograph that's a key instrument of astronomy dating back to fraunhofer who first made spectral measurements of the sun in the year 1800 so spectroscopy has been a key to astronomy ever since 1800 for over two centuries late in the 19th century spectroscopy was used to see elements in the universe and what the composition of stars were in fact helium was first discovered in space in stellar spectra before it was ever discovered on the earth raising the question of whether it was some strange element unknown on the earth in the early to mid 20th century careful observations of stars showed that the stars were made of primarily hydrogen and helium and then even more careful observations showed what the relative abundance of all the elements in the periodic table were in solar system material or in the atmospheres of stars so spectroscopy has been a key method for learning about the universe in this case we're using spectroscopy in a very precise way to look at very small spectral shifts over time the way this is done is by using the absorption lines in a star spectrum in a star like the sun radiation is produced in the stellar core and the cooler gas in the outer atmosphere of the star imprints absorption lines which are absorption features keyed to the particular energy transitions of the atoms that the star is made of and so in this toy spectrum you can see the smooth continuous spectrum caused by the temperature of the star has overlaid on it dark notches or absorption and that pattern of absorption corresponds to the spectral lines emitted primarily from hydrogen and helium the two elements of which most stars are made these black lines are called absorption lines and that pattern is like a fingerprint the pattern of absorption lines is a unique to each element or to each combination of elements in the periodic table these spectra can be characterized by laboratories on the earth so as a reference point for what we see out in the universe out in space you can have a gas in a cell at low density excited by energy or radiation which does the same thing it emits emission lines or absorption lines with the characteristic pattern corresponding to the chemical element involved and so that's our zero point because the gas in the in the lab or in the telescope control room is not moving and then we compare it to what's happening out in space so the absorption lines in stellar spectra are serving essentially as markers of wavelengths and if the lines are not at the same wavelengths as they appear in the lab for that same element then we know the source emitting the light must be experiencing some kind of motion now it helps in the detection of exoplanets that these absorption lines are extremely narrow allowing us to define their mean wavelengths at rest extremely accurately tiny fractions of a percent and that gives us corresponding precision in measuring the motion of a celestial object so by monitoring motion of a star over time we observe the periodic doppler shift as the absorption lines appear to be redshifted and blue shifted and this cartoon shows what's happening there's the orbit of the planet around the star about a common center of gravity the reflex motion and that star wobble while invisible on the plane of the sky manifests in terms of a spectroscopic shift and so the lines the absorption lines of any particular element in the outer envelope of the star will shift red and blue with a sinusoidal variation in wavelength over time corresponding to the orbit and each orbit it repeats so we define this as the radial velocity of the star which is the component of the star's motion towards and away from the observer for us there's also a transverse motion of the star and that transverse motion does not exhibit any doppler effect because if a source of waves is moving in a purely transverse direction it does not change with time or with the motion so there's no redshift or blue shift to be seen the amount by which the starlight is doppler shifted is directly proportional to the radial velocity of the star and so the measurement is quite simple to convert from spectroscopy into velocity in space and by monitoring the spectrum of the star over a long period of time corresponding to many orbits of the planet around the star we can actually attain a very high precision in the detection of its wobble this shows the schematic not real data in this case of the reflex motion of how this doppler shift manifests and so here's an example reference to something like an earth with a one year motion and you can see the velocity marked on the vertical axis time on the horizontal axis and so this is the reflex motion of a planet orbiting a star converted into a radial velocity showing its sinusoidal variation of red blue shift and then redshift over time and the amplitude of this radial velocity is a direct measured by spectroscopy as a direct indication of the mass of the planet so a massive planet like a jupiter will have a correspondingly larger radial velocity also obviously easier to detect than a super earth or an earth the first exoplanet to be discovered this way was 51 peg the first exoplanet of all in 1995 and many of the first few hundred exoplanets were discovered with this technique as i mentioned this was very surprising because it was such a fast orbit and such a massive planet now in this case we can actually see the real data that was used this is not the discovery data was a lot poorer and noisier this is more recent data of that same system but it shows the sinusoidal variation in radial velocity with a mean of zero and you can see the error on an individual data point and with a four and a half day orbit if you gather a month's worth of data you've measured essentially eight different orbits so you can imagine this playing out in two directions as you gather data and eventually you can fold the data over to make one full orbit and add all the data together all the data points add and you get a more precise measure of the mass of the star and that method is used for many of the exoplanets we've found so far the radial velocity method does have limitations the most obvious one as you've seen is that the amplitude of the radial velocity effect is proportional to the mass of a planet and at some point given the errors associated with each measurement the amplitude will be too small to measure with this method no matter how much data you gather gathering more data is always better and does let you pull objects out of the noise so bigger planets cause more obvious shifts in the light smaller planets cause smaller shifts red and blue and the radial velocity curve and eventually the shift becomes imperceptible for the radial method radial velocity method this happens around an earth mass and so the radial velocity method is essentially not going to be possible for planets much less than the earth mass there's also a fundamental reason for this that's nothing to do with the technique it's because you're looking at motions induced from the atmosphere of the star stars have turbulent motions we can look at the convective cells of the plasma and the sun and those cells are rising and falling at roughly a meter or a few meters per second so what happens as you push down towards earth sized radial velocity effects is you start to run into the noise of actual turbulent motions in the atmosphere of a sun like star which is a noise effect that you cannot circumvent because it's fundamental to the way stars work and so it's expected that there's no clever way to circumvent this limitation and that essentially means we're near the end of the road of what can be done with radial velocity technique but it still will be able to pull in masses like the earth which is a pretty important benchmark another limitation is that the orbital distance that the gravitational influence decreases over distance and so when the distance is large the radial velocity effect becomes small too and so we can't detect planets of a particular mass at a very large distance something i didn't mention is that many of these systems now many exoplanet systems have more than one planet and so the method there allows you to take more than one planet from the same curve the examples we've seen are just for one planet orbiting a star but what if there are several almost equal mass planets orbiting the star each of those planets imprints a sinusoidal variation on the star's radial velocity and they just add together in mathematical terms we do a fourier analysis and we can pick out each component of those sinusoidal variations and distinguish multiple planets down to the level where the mass is too small because they simply are additive effects on the spectrum now if there were very many planets it might get messy and complex but this technique has been done very well and it's quite possible to detect multiple planets from a single set of radial velocity observations and the proof of all this is this amazing curve that we've seen before of how the minimum mass detectable by this the radial velocity technique because these are planets found that way rather than by the kepler method has marched downwards and so this incredible gain and sensitivity over close to a factor of a thousand or at least several hundred since 51 peg is based entirely on spectroscopic precision on having very accurate wavelength source so that your reference point for zero motion is precise on having extremely high dispersion spectrographs so you're dispersing the wavelengths very finely on your charge coupled device or ccd detector and making extremely precise measurements of those absorption lines and then just having long term stability of your observational setup your telescope and your instrument so that you can gather data for weeks and months with nothing changing all of these attention to these details high precision in the spectrograph and careful experimental technique are basically the reason why this has happened there are indeed larger telescopes now than there were in 1995 but much of this work is done without using the world's largest telescopes because the stars involved are fairly bright another limitation of the radial velocity method is it tells us nothing about the size of the planet because it's measuring a reflex motion and because it's based in the law of gravity it's about the gravitational influence of the planet on the star and vice versa and so it's really measuring mass and not size and there's a redundancy there because a large density a large low density planet and a small high density planet obviously can have the same mass so the doppler measurement on its own gives no indication as to how big a planet actually is it tells us about its orbit and it tells us about its mass and that's all another limitation is the geometry of the system as you saw earlier what you actually measure is the mass times the sine of the inclination angle where the inclination angle is the way the orbit is inclined to the line of sight in these little cartoons you can see that in the situation where you're looking in the equatorial plane of the planetary system you see the full representation of the doppler shift of the radial velocity shift periodically whereas if the transverse to the line of sight 90 degrees you see zero effect even though this orbit is clearly happening and the star is clearly being tugged in its orbit now on average you'll be at some intermediate inclination and see some fraction of the full radial velocity effect that inclination is not measurable by the observation itself and so that is an uncertainty in the mass that you determine the reassurance is that once you have statistically large samples and you assume that planetary systems are randomly oriented in three dimensions you can show that on average that underestimates the total masses of an ensemble of exoplanets by a factor of two so we've seen that the radial velocity method is extremely powerful it led to the first detection of an exoplanet in 1995 and it led to the vast majority of the few hundred exoplanets detected in the decade after that it's based on the reflex motion of a star caused by the gravitational influence of the exoplanet the periodic doppler shift in the starlight indicates the mass of the planet it's a direct application of newton's law of gravity because the shift in starlight is proportional to the mass of the star the radial velocity can be used to infer the mass of the star because the orbit repeats you can continue gathering data and beat down the noise with repeated observations and so push this technique right down to about an earth mass at that point it runs into fundamental limitations the majority of the early discoveries and still continuing discoveries are made with the radial velocity technique [Music]
