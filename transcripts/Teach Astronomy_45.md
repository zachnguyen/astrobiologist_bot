[Music] in this lecture we'll look at life in the phanerozoic area or after the cambrian explosion the cambrian explosion was an extraordinary episode in the history of life on earth in a relatively short time geologically speaking of 20 to 25 million years a burst of evolutionary innovation occurs that marks the beginning of this era life was primed to explode into new ecological niches freed up by the warming climate all the major body plans and associated phyla in the tree of life formed during this time although life would not leave the oceans for more than 150 million years more the cambrian explosion saw a dramatic increase in genetic diversity sexual reproduction allowed for trading and updating genetic information through generations there's evidence that genetic information can be exchanged in packages organisms can co opt each other and therefore their entire genomes so evolution does not just have to happen by the simple genetic mutation and alteration of the dna strand itself in this time we see the first chordates which are the ancestors of vertebrates organisms that include humans these all emerge during this time but also the body plans of organisms now long extinct that look like any other living creature we have on the earth today all modern biological life emerged from the organisms that saw first light of day during this period that's remarkable in a four billion year history of a life on earth how much of the accelerated evolution happened during one period specialized cells allow the body shape of organisms to diversify into variety of body plans that we see today time and the evolution of what are called hox genes modified these existing phyla a new phylum has not emerged in the 500 million years since the cambrian explosion let's look at the diversity and also the overlap of the genetic code of different types of modern day organisms the eukaryotic genome is similar across species for example between any two humans 99.9 percent of the genetic information or the genome is shared we differ by only 0.1 or 0.2 percent from our ape ancestors bonobos and chimpanzees so we overlap by almost 99 percent with them we have 90 percent overlap with the genome of mice 84 with the genome of dogs 65 percent with birds and more remarkably we share more than half our dna or our genome with bananas we don't think we're very similar to fruit but in fact in genetic material terms that's quite a large amount of overlap which also indirectly indicates that the advanced function of humans relative to these simpler life forms must be coded into a relatively small number of genes while the sequence of bases present in the dna of every organism is different organisms are essentially the same in their architecture at the cellular level subtle variations on these different genes is what gives us the range of morphology in biological life in particular a component called a hox gene is the code for regulatory proteins specific to each species that dictate how genetic expression occurs hox genes dictate the morphological expression in a developing embryo for example the hox10 gene runs the rib program it tells the body which vertebrae grow ribs and which do not the hawx10 genes and snakes have lost their ability to block the growth of ribs on vertebrae which may be why ribs grow on snakes over all of their vertebrae some hox genes are universal mouse hawk genes can be substituted for the same hox genes and flies and they'll carry out their correct function this idea of interchangeable body parts and a building plan that uses similar subcomponents almost like lego blocks genetically is a powerful way that life can diversify using simple components the other part of the evolution of life beyond its genetic ingredients is of course the external environment so the evolution of life has always been driven by environmental factors too much toxic oxygen and life has to invent a way to use enzymes to neutralize the damage of that oxygen and use oxygen as an electron acceptor mobility helps survival and so the very first cells learned how to move through their liquid environments the action of hox genes skips the need to invent new body plants for each species so that's an efficiency in the way evolution works plants are an abundant energy source for higher organisms so you can consume plants and then skip the process of photosynthesis and now we have the food chain or the food web small herbivores are abundant energy sources for higher creatures so consuming small herbivores and you can skip the competition for plants finally land life represents a greater mobility challenge due to the gravity and working through the atmosphere and with a terrain that might be formidable and because of the gaseous oxygen so existing structures genetically have to be modified to be able to deal with the land to be able to walk on the land or be mobile and to be able to breathe the air with its high oxygen content the punchline of all this is that evolution is both innovative and frugal frugal in the sense that it must conserve energy and use it efficiently or use the most efficient way of extracting energy from the environment innovative in the sense that genetic diversity tends to increase and that genetic diversity will be pruned back by its ability to survive in a changing environment and the nature of life on earth has always been inextricably linked to the environment vegetation was a new ingredient in the history of life on earth starting a little under half a billion years ago plants began to first colonize dry land during the ordovician period about 490 million years ago by the time of the carboniferous period 360 to 300 million years ago lush plant growth is covering the land and when it's laid down deposited and compressed by geology and the passage of time it forms coal deposits the primordial continent gondwana merges with your america to form pangaea and we can see here a map of the early earth showing the positions of the continents back then as for oxygen levels prior to the ordovician photosynthesizing bacteria and marine flora raised the oxygen globally from under 2 to 18 almost its present day level oxygen actually reached a peak concentration of 35 percent during the carboniferous period the atmosphere was close to combustible at that time remember that's nearly twice the oxygen content of the air we breathe the presence of life on land plus in the oceans raises the idea of biosignatures in astrobiology if we're trying to find life on a distant exoplanet we want some signature of its presence remember how hard it is to learn anything about an exoplanet beyond its mass and its size the idea of biosignatures is a frontier field in astrobiology because it's what we hope to be able to do in the next decades when we have better information on the exo earth that we're finding with kepler spacecraft so biosignature in biology is just a way to infer the presence of life when direct observation is not possible we try to give the history of life on earth and we have to use biosignatures for long periods of time when the fossil evidence or the rock record is patchy or incomplete so there are broad categories of biosignatures the first evidence of life on earth uses very subtle changes in the isotopic balance of carbon isotopes as the indicator of a metabolism at work this is at a time long before there were body fossils or visible fossils we can look at the temporal changes in the atmosphere of a planet as an indirect indicator of life remembering that the oxygen we breathe was put there by microbes several billion years ago so oxygen itself is a biomarker for the earth and we would imagine is a biomarker on other exo earths far from the earth change in the planet reflectance if we could measure it is also an indication of biology because when life covers the land vegetation for example it changes the way that planet will reflect a star's light and we might be able to detect that and finally the most advanced form of biosignature comes from the most advanced forms of life which is technological civilization so if we're looking for life that's got to the point that we have we look for an entirely new set of signatures based on harnessing technology and possibly altering the global climate and terrain of the planet itself earth serves as a template for what we might seek on other exoplanets so we start with a model of the earth and characterize the results to give us a good theoretical foundation here we can see a reflectance spectrum of the earth and the key features that correspond to biosignatures are obvious there's water vapor because there's water in the oceans and also in the earth's atmosphere and then there are particular markers for oxygen oxygen we believe to be a good biosignature because it's imputed to be biological life causing it studying spectra of familiar surfaces on earth help scientists interpret whether similar conditions might exist on exoplanets so basically we're looking for what life is imprinted on a planet globally since there's no way telescopes for a long time will be able to take an exoplanet and stare at it at the level even of continents so we're looking at global signatures in spectra primarily in the visible range but also extending into the infrared where there are strong spectral features for example from ozone which is an indirect indicator of oxygen these are very challenging observations when observing a planet trillions of miles away but if you have high quality features then you can see the spectral lines of interest this is an example of absorption caused by sodium atoms in an exoplanet atmosphere these features can easily be seen in high quality data so far only a handful of chemical elements and molecules have been seen in the atmospheres of exoplanets these include water vapor which is interesting but the exoplanets where it was seen are very hot and so this is in the form of steam in the atmosphere so far no oxygen has been seen in the atmosphere of any exoplanet but only a half a dozen or so have been studied so far with these very difficult observations typical data has much larger error bars so this kind of noisy data is more typical of what we'll see the james webb space telescope which is the successor to the hubble space telescope is due to be launched in a couple of years and it will spend a significant fraction of its time perhaps a third of the telescope time looking at exoplanets trying to get reflectant spectra like this but extending into the infrared to look for the very subtle signatures of biology in the atmospheres of exo earths and super earth it's very exciting science that could lead to the first detection of life beyond earth the cambrian explosion was a period of time about half a billion years ago when the variety of life on earth exploded literally and metaphorically almost all the body plans we see of plants and animals stem from genetic experimentation from this time in the oceans the cambrian explosion corresponded to life on earth in a gentler time after the last snowball episode life eventually moved on to the land in the form of plants about 400 million years ago and then eventually larger creatures all of this evolution was sculpted by the environment and the changing environment of course represented both an obstacle a challenge and an opportunity to more diverse forms of life when astronomers are trying to diagnose the presence of life on a distant exoplanet they look for biosignatures since we can't inspect exoplanets at the level of continents or detailed features these biosignatures come from a spectrum of reflected light of the entire planet and what we're looking for is alteration of the atmosphere caused by biology on the earth the classic biosignature would be water vapor indicating water in the atmosphere and the oceans and oxygen and ozone since we know that the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere was put there by biological organisms several billion years ago
