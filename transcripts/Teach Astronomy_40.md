[Music] in this lecture we consider life at the extreme the extremes of life on earth are illustrative for astrobiology or life beyond the earth because we need to know the full range of physical and chemical conditions under which biology can operate on this planet is at least a guide to what biology might be capable of beyond the earth but we should remember in doing this that that's just a bound provided by this planet physical conditions on exoplanets will be different beyond the bounds of life on earth and life may well adapt to those increased boundaries or different physical conditions so understanding the range of life on earth is innately conservative because we don't know how strange life can be in other locations but it's clear evidence now as we study the history of life on earth that many of life's most important features and most successful components involve dealing with extremes of physical conditions and so the idea of darwin that life started in a warm little pond at a temperate process is probably not true wife almost certainly started in deep sea hydrothermal vents with high pressurized conditions and what would be presently toxic chemical conditions and without even the sun's radiation penetrating and even on the present earth we can find examples of life that likes extreme conditions and these are called collectively extremophiles most biological life has evolved into recognizable forms that need sunlight air and water but extremophiles are a class of organisms unto themselves they have been found to inhabit environments on the earth that will be uninhabitable to other forms of life extremophiles are generally but not exclusively microbial or bacterial we'll give some examples of the ranges of conditions that extremophiles can function in and when we say tolerate or survive that's actually not quite right extremophiles thrive persist and do quite well with these extreme environments there's no problem for an extremophile in their physical conditions because they've adapted through biology to those conditions extremophiles that can handle extreme cold are called psychophiles or cryophiles and they can survive temperatures below the freezing point of water now that's interesting because we've already defined habitable zone in astrobiology as the range of distances from a star where water will be liquid on the surface of an earth like planet but we already have examples on the earth of life that can persist in temperatures below the freezing point of water part of that's because of the unusual property of water as a molecule which is when it freezes it expands now when water freezes it would normally burst and kill a normal cell disrupting the cell wall so psychophiles have evolved a type of biological antifreeze that prevents them from individually freezing as water freezes and expands the other attribute of water that helps the persistence of life in cold environments is the same expansion property which means that a large body of water will never freeze solid but will have an icy top and never freeze all the way through and so can average out extremes of temperature fluctuation to maintain a liquid part psychophiles have invented by natural selection would amass to antifreeze to survive below the freezing point of water at the other extreme the habitable zone stops at the point where water will boil 100 degrees kelvin normally organisms begin to experience bad side effects at extremely high temperatures humans can obviously not withstand very high temperatures so higher organisms are unable to handle extreme heat but microbial organisms can handle heat and they can handle temperatures beyond the boiling point of water i think the current record is about 145 degrees c substantially above the boiling point of water thermophiles as they're called tend to be found near hydrothermal vents and deep underground where there's a lot of energy created from the interior of the earth's core by radioactive heating now this process cannot go on at impossibly high temperatures there's a temperature beyond which dna the information storage molecule or rna starts to unravel or denature and so biology is not possible at certainly very high temperatures because the information storage essential to biology is not possible life has evolved in some situations an extraordinary capacity to withstand radiation we talked about the buffering effects of the earth's atmosphere and the earth's magnetic field in protecting life from radiation from space but some microorganisms some extremophiles tolerate and thrive with extraordinary high radiation doses an extraordinary microbe called dinococcus radiodurans was discovered a few decades ago these microbes were found actually in a can of meat that had been irradiated in an attempt to sterilize it subsequent study showed that they can tolerate tens of thousands of times the level of radiation that will kill a human in seconds to do this they have an extraordinary strategy they actually have short fragments of dna and they keep stacked multiple copies of this dna they have a repair rate for their dna which all organisms have thousands of times faster and more efficient than the repair mechanisms that humans use for their dna so these organisms again do not just tolerate but they thrive situations of high radiation other microbes like this have been found too so microbes have been found in situations of unusual radiation there were microbes launched into the vacuum of space on the legs of spacecraft that apparently survived those situations for days another type of extremophile can handle toxic or chemically challenging environments most organisms like humans cannot tolerate heavy metals and toxic mining sites such as the epa sites in the united states keep humans away because these are so dangerous to humans but in these same toxic sites microbiologists found organisms happily living in the superheated water emerging from hot springs that was dissolved with high amounts of lead cadmium and other heavy metals like mercury extraordinary in fact these microbes were actually metabolizing these metals acidophiles thrive in regions where the ph is 3 or lower and remember that tooth enamel dissolves at a ph of less than about five so we have tolerant organisms at all ranges of the ph spectrum from battery acid to drain cleaner and extremely high concentrations of toxic heavy elements once again life on earth has proved extraordinarily adaptable life needs water but how absolute is that statement there's a type of extremophile called a xerophile that have found their way into the popular media because of spectacular situations where life apparently survives extremely arid situations parts of the northern atacama desert in chile are as dry as any place on the earth there are places there where it hasn't rained for over a century or in recorded history and yet in these driest places on the earth where there's a tiny amount of rain and it's very episodic microbes have been found in fact astrobiologists use these environments to train for mars missions because mars is also a very arid place and microbes somehow manage to find a way to persist in these environments and they do so by taking their metabolism down to an extremely low rate their replication rate of their cells may be tens hundreds or even thousands of times less than the replication rate of plants and animals once again they're also dealing with fairly high doses of radiation so while life does need water it doesn't need much water at all and so we can imagine life in other situations in the universe where there's not much water present or water is only episodically present exobiology is the idea of life beyond the earth and so we use the full range of life on earth especially the early earth where conditions were extreme to understand what the range of life beyond earth might be and when we notice that life on earth extremophiles has expanded into almost every imaginable niche in ecological terms and some that are essentially unimaginable then we've learned something important about the possibilities for life in the universe most of these extremophiles are not like us they're single celled organisms very like this first life forms on the earth so how often does this form of life arise on other planets the experiment of how life forms other than looking the historical record can be done in the lab and looking at the range of physical conditions for that life can also be done in the lab the prototype of that experiment was called the miliuri experiment in the early 1950s scientists stanley miller and harold bury carried out an experiment that was a classic study in what's called a biogenesis the formation of life in the lab in a chemically controlled situation their apparatus illustrated here on the left sealed water methane ammonia and hydrogen in a flask these chemicals were chosen to represent the chemicals present on the early earth and in its atmosphere the water was boiled and energy was added in this case by an electrical discharge but in other versions of the experiment it's done by ultraviolet radiation such as might happen with lightning discharge the steam rose after the water was boiled and passed through another flask with electrodes where the energy was added and then the deposits that were left behind in the flask were studied over a period of time after one week of running this experiment continuously a brown sludge had accumulated in the u trap and in the bottom of the flask the sludge was analyzed to show that five of the basic amino acids necessary for life have been synthesized from the original simple ingredients further study showed that this method of synthesizing amino acids on the early earth actually generated a much larger suite of amino acids nearly identical to those present in the merchants and meteorite for example and the grid of these is shown on the right in fact some of the original miliary data was reanalyzed less than five years ago fifty years after the original experiment and more complex chemicals were found from their original data the miller urey experiment was wrong in one important aspect it had too much hydrogen in the gas present in the flask representing a reducing atmosphere it's now thought that the early earth released most of its hydrogen into space so there was very little hydrogen in the early earth's atmosphere so people have redone the military experiment with atmosphere that more closely represents the early earth's atmosphere and the results are the same amino acids other simple fats and lipids form naturally without any special intervention fairly quickly with the addition of energy these life in a bottle experiments from the 1950s and their more recent versions have not created life none of them actually came even close but they showed how plausible it is in the early earth condition to generate from the very simplest chemical ingredients of just a few atoms in a molecule to more complex chemical ingredients with a few dozens of atoms in a molecule and these are now molecules which have functional forms and shapes which facilitate further chemical reactions complexity builds on complexity and that's how life must have started and these other recent experiments alluded to just now say that vesicles or simple cell precursors could have formed and then concentrated these simple chemicals so chemical complexity builds on itself in a positive feedback sense and that's how it's conceivable that you can go from simple molecules of a few dozen atoms to the rna and dna chains millions of atoms long and of course all of this is in the context of what happens elsewhere when a planetary system forms around a star with some habitable planets defined by their basic properties how often will life develop on those planets if we can't get life from the melar yuri experiment but life formed on the early earth when conditions were very extreme how many of the exobiology situations we found with thousands of exoplanets are suitable for life planets are likely to be very simple in their overall chemical composition and quite similar to each other with relatively large amounts of hydrogen carbon nitrogen and oxygen with phosphorus which we know to be essential for atp the energy storing molecule and have many of the same organic compounds present on the primordial earth we might say that our solar system started with two potentially habitable planets and possibly three if we include a temperate early venus life developed on one of those planets and so do we know whether life ever evolved on venus and mars making possibly three habitable planets over the whole history of the solar system our data is limited to the earth so in terms of trying to project these numbers out into space we have to define a parameter to represent the likelihood that life will avert emerge given all the ingredients on habitable planet in our solar system we might estimate that parameter as a half if we include mars as a habitable planet or maybe a similar number if venus was also when considering planetary systems in general we really don't know how to choose this parameter we could say that this fraction is 0.01 which means that life develops only on one of every hundred habitable planets or one which means that every time the ingredients are there given sufficient time life evolves this is currently the biggest uncertainty in astrobiology and we can see how tantalizing the early evidence of the earth is in considering this out in the universe extremophiles are simple organisms that expand the parameters for life because they show that simple biological life forms present on the early earth and some of them still present on the earth can live in physical conditions that would be intolerable to complex forms of life like plants animals and us extremophiles are probably our best examples for understanding how life might adapt or evolve in the first place on exoplanets with similarly severe conditions we've had experiments in the lab like the milliuri experiment that show how the building blocks of life the level of amino acids fats and simple bases can form quite naturally in concentrated solution simply with the addition of energy you
