Science fiction has come up with countlessideas for weird forms of life not based on boring old DNA, or even on matter as we knowit. There’s Stanislaw Lem’s sentient oceanin Solaris, or the neutron star civilization made of nuclear matter in Robert L Forward’sDragon’s Egg. Oh, and here’s an extra crazy one   life composedof cosmic strings and magnetic monopoles, evolving in the hearts of stars. Oh, wait a minute   that last one is an actualscientific proposal. Scientists can sometimes be a little carbon chauvanisticwhen we imagine other possible life forms. Which is understandable   carbon based chemistryenables the most complex structures that we know of in this universe. But could some other mechanism exist thatcould allow the incredible chemical diversity needed to power life? Well, not that we know of. But that hasn’t stopped some scientistsfrom looking. One of the most bizarre proposals for lifenot as we know it doesn’t even use atoms. It proposes that fundamental kinks and defectsin the fabric of the universe   cosmic strings beaded with magnetic monopoles   may evolveinto complex structures, and even life, within stars. This idea was just published in Letters HighEnergy Physics Letters by physicists Luis Anchordoqui and Eugene Chudnovsky, and todayon Space Time Journal Club we’re going to see how legit this idea actually is. But first we need to go through some of thebasics. What exactly are cosmic strings and magneticmonopoles? Both of these are fascinating subjects welloverdue for their own episodes, so I’ll keep in brief here. Cosmic strings and magnetic monopoles arewhat we call topological defects. The best way to describe topological defectsis with some examples. Imagine a fur rug in which you can brush thefur to lie in whatever direction you like. If the fur is pushed to the left at one endand the right at the other end, then somewhere in between there must be a transition betweenthe two states. There’s no way for that transition to besmooth, so you have this line. You can move the line around by brushing therug left or right, but you can’t get rid of it without brushing the entire rug in onedirection. You could also get a topological defect ifyou tried to brush the rug into a spiral. The transition between all points would besmooth, with the grain changing angle only slightly. But at the eye of the spiral you’d havea non smooth transition. And that’s the common feature of a topologicaldefect   a sudden change in the “grain” of some space that can’t easily be disentangled. You can have exactly the same thing in magneticmaterials, where the direction of the poles of the little magnetic particles changes acrossthe substance. Topological defects are also found in crystals. They form during the phase transition fromliquid to solid. That crystallization can begin in differentplaces in the liquid. And these lattice regions spread and joinuntil you have a single crystal, but if those initial regions didn’t all line up in thesame way then you have defects where the regions meet each other. Quantum fields should also be able to develop topological defects. These may have been formed soon after theBig Bang when massive phase transitions swept across the universe. These transitions were analogous to the phasetransitions between states of matter   for example, water freezing into ice. But here, the quantum fields themselves changed state due to the rapidly dropping temperature. The technical term is “spontaneous symmetrybreaking”   the same events that led to the appearance of the separate forces froman initial unified force. We’ll be discussing that more in the future,but for now the important thing is that these phase transitions could have resulted in differenttypes of topological defects, just like when crystals form. Let’s go through the possibilities: a 0 dimensionaltopological defect is a magnetic monopole   like the north or south pole of a bar magnetthat somehow lost its counterpart. A 1 D topological defect is a cosmic string  an extremely thin filament. 2 D defects are called domain walls   they’rethe boundaries between regions of the universe with different properties   for example, differentvacuum energies. We’re interested in the strings and monopolesfor now. In certain theoretical scenarios, a monopolecan be connected to the end of a string   or two strings, actually. Such monopoles are called beads. And you can have a chain of beads   a necklace.. Anchordoqui and Chudnovsky imagine a typeof nuclear life, in which these chains form complex structures that can have a sort ofchemistry   possibly even evolving into what we might call life. The goal of their study was to figure outunder what circumstances this might happen. The authors lay out three conditions for lifethat they investigate. Let’s go through them. Condition 1) The ability to encode information. Fair enough   our DNA encodes all the instructionsour cells need to build the molecular machinery of life. It’s hard to imagine a life form that didn’thave a way to store information. Condition 2) The ability of information carriersto replicate faster than they disintegrate. Again, straight forward   any given chainof molecules holds information, but it isn’t much good if it falls apart before it reproducesitself. And 3) a source of free energy. This is something we know is essential forany life, including nuclear life. Let’s go through each of these conditions in detail. Can these string monopole necklaces storeinformation? Well, in DNA there are 4 different base pairsand the ordering of those base pairs is a language   it dictates the order of aminoacids transcribed into proteins. With simple magnetic monopoles, the only possiblenecklace is an alternating series of north and south poles   or poles and anti poles. There’s only one possible configuration,and so there’s no way to store information that way. But if you add slightly more exotic physicsyou can form different types of monopole. For example, there’s this scenario in thisearly universe symmetry breaking stuff where, after the monopoles form, they split in two  into so called semi poles. There are four types of seminole   two foreach of the original monopole type. Four coding “letters”   sounds a bit likeDNA. Semipoles have an added bonus: whereas monopolesand anti monopoles will always attract each other and annihilate if they come together. With semipoles, it’s possible to form stringsegments capped by NON annihilating semipole pairs that actually repel each other. In this way, it may be possible to developcomplex string structures, analogous to chemistry. And maybe you can even build something like DNA. OK, moving on to life condition number 2:can these information carriers replicate faster than they can disintegrate? These necklaces are probably not too stable  but that’s OK as long you can replicate them faster than they fall apart. And this is where stars come in. Others have speculated that cosmic stringsmay get trapped inside stars in the process of star formation. Those stellar interiors might then providethe mechanism for necklaces to rapidly change and even replicate. Depending on the stellar type and region,the insides of stars can be very turbulent places. Flowing plasma and magnetic fields may stretchand break necklaces, which could reconfigure them over and over until they find a statethat is stable in the environment, combined with developing the ability to replicate fasterthan they are torn apart. As for how that replication happens   wellthe study doesn’t go into detail, except to say that it might be catalyzed by interactionswith atomic nuclei in the star. Perhaps nuclei somehow help necklaces builda parallel chain of beads, that then peels off as an identical necklace, similar to howRNA reproduces. And finally, life condition number 3: do wehave a source of free energy? By free energy, I don’t mean energy thatyou don’t have to pay for. I mean energy that is available for use, ina thermodynamic sense. Energy can only be used to do work if thereexists differences in the amount of energy in different possible states. If energy is concentrated in certain placeswe would call that an ordered, low entropy situation. Energy likes to spread itself out as evenlyas possible, moving towards disordered, high entropy states. It’s possible to use energy as it flowsbetween different states in this process, like putting a water wheel in a flowing river. For example, life uses the energy flowingfrom the high energy density of the Sun to the lower energy density of the Earth. In fact we talked about all of that in ourepisode on the physics of life. We saw that these temporary increases in order, represented by life, actually speed up the process of smoothing out all of the energy. Little low entropy blips like life ultimatelyaccelerate the increase in entropy of the universe. OK, so inside a star there’s definitelyfree energy. Energy flows from the fusion engine in thecore to the surface. It’s conceivable that a lifeform could harnessthat flow. Well what would that look like? Well, it would have to hasten the spreadingout of energy. Energy could be spread more evenly acrossthe electromagnetic spectrum, which would look like cooling   the star might appearcooler than it should. Or perhaps the nuclear reactions in the coreproceed faster, hastening the dissipation of the star’s energy through space. At any rate, the star should behave differentlyto what our stellar physics models predict. There are a few stars in our modern surveysthat don’t quite act as they should, however there are many other possible explanationsand it might be a little premature to claim discovery of a new lifeform. We’re going to have to get a much betterunderstanding of cosmic strings and monopoles   and, you know, actually verify that theyexist in the first place   before we can decide whether they can interact with the complexityneeded to evolve into life. And the authors of this paper are not pretendingthat any of this is likely   their point is more to show that other possible bases forlife might exist, beyond the familiar carbon chemistry. So are the stars filled with thriving ecosystemsof critters built from fractured quantum fields? Not likely, but not yet impossible. And who knows what other bizarre life formsmay be waiting to be discovered, in distant, stranger parts of space time. Hey Everyone. A few announcements before we get to comments It's that time of year again where PBS DIgital Studios and  Space Time want to hear from you Every year we do an audience survey that helps us know what you like, what you don't and want other kinds of content you want to see. The Space Time audience has always done a great job making their voices heard on the survey, so check out the link in the description and let us know what you think! Well regardless going to keep making Space Time and keep making it better   and a big part of what makes that possible is the support we get from some of you on Patreon. Those few bucks a month really lets us plan much further ahead. For those of you who might be thinking of helping out   added bonus is that we have this hoppin Patreon discord channel where space and physics geeks from around the world ponder the nature of reality. And while I'm talking Patreon, I have to give a gigantic shoutout to James Younger, who supports us at the Big Bang level. For those who don't know, James is a higher being composed of cosmic strings and monopoles, visiting Earth from the core of the Sun to help spread cosmic wisdom. By, like, supporting physics youtube shows and such. Thanks James, may your semipoles never annihilate. Hey everyone. Comment responses today are on our episode on the pursuit of beauty in physics. A very contentious topic these days   andso sparked some passionate debate in the comments. I’m not going to go too deep into the backand forth right now… but will make my own stance very clear. Many of you mentioned Sabine Hossenfelder,whose book Lost in the Math was a big part of highlighting this issue of excessive dependenceon beauty. She’s of course not the only one to highlightthis. But tor Sabine’s own words read the book andcheck out our Theories of Everything livestream from a month ago, also with Lee Smolin andEric Weinstein. Look, I don’t want to get to much into whereI agree or disagree with these guys here   but I will say this   it’s useful to highlightwhen we think science is going astray, and Sabine and others see a real problem withthe excessive weight placed on the importance of mathematical beauty, by some, perhaps bymany, in the theory of everything game. But I also have to add   do not throw thebaby out with the bathwater. Arguably the greatest advances of the 20thcentury were in part driven by the simple intuitions of the likes of Einstein and Diracthat physical law should be mathematically elegant. So we should try to learn from the past successesof this pursuit of beauty in math, as well as its failures. The failures tell us that the narrow mindedpursuit of pure beauty at the expense of everything else is doomed. Why? Because beauty is not a fundamental propertyof the universe   it is, by definition, a subjective sense. Which means it’s a proxy for other morefundamental qualities. So let’s identify those qualities that ourbeauty compass is pointing to. We can allow our powerful and inexplicableintuition for beauty guide us subtly, while at the same time remaining healthily skepticaleven of our own intuitions. Regarding the epicycles in Ptolemy’s theory,Ry706 says “adding epicycles upon epicycles can represent any motion is literally trueby Fourier theory”. Ry706   that’s exactly what epicycles are,thank you! For those unfamiliar   Fourier’s theoremtells us that we can represent any continuous, periodic function can be represented as asum of sine waves of different frequencies. But then motion in a circle can be representedby 2 separate sine waves for displacement in the x y directions. So any arbitrarily complex orbital motioncan be represented with enough sine wave pairs in a fourier series   which can also looklike a series of epicycles. That’s why Ptolemy was able to make thisEarth centered model sort of work   with enough epicycles he could have created a workingmodel centered on the moon, or on the library of Alexandria, or on his mom. And this is why Occam’s razor is useful  it kindly requests that we please slice off as many literal and metaphorical epicyclesas possible. Speaking of beauty, Joey Crowly asks everyoneto please give some mad props to the animators of this show, with the production qualitybeing absolutely off the chain. Uh, you’re not kidding Jaoey. Animators Leo, Yago & Pedro and team are theones who really bring this show alive. I felt terrible asking for the fur rug animationfrom today’s episode   and honestly I don’t know how they managed to do pull it off ina couple of days. Leo and team   mad props from all of of usfans. Shirsendu Chatterjee points out that it’sfinally time to give the address to the time traveler’s party that we hosted a year ago. At the time no one showed up, but that onlytells us that time travel is false if we actually give the address as promised. Done   here’s the time and address. We wrote it in neutrinos, just to make sureonly sufficiently advanced civilizations can read it   don’t want any of those lame steampunktime travelers showing up. See you at the party. Which we didn’t. I guess that scientifically proves that timetravel is impossible, or that we’re scientifically conclusively unpopular with the cool time travelerset. Cue highschool flashbacks.
