what is your favorite answer to fermi's question where are they oh fascinating I just read a book called where is everybody and they gave 50 reasons why aliens haven't been in contact 50 plausible hypotheses of all of those I think the most reasonable is that the astronomical distance between Star systems are so incredibly huge that it is fundamentally impractical for aliens to travel between Star systems and just as an example Alpha Satori which is a cluster of three stars sort of in this very really incredible dance going on three dimensional orbits that's 4.2 4.26 light years away current rocketry would take like 80 000 years to have a spaceship reach the closest star the distances are just way too big to have this easily happen
