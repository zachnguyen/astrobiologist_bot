[Music] well hello everyone first of all I'd like to thank for the organizers for having me here and I have already experienced how great this community can be I can tell that this is really a space for all uh so um how many of you like chemistry here in the audience quieter a few people here so um uh I will basically follow the logic of this quote throughout my whole presentation so probably what we're what I am doing and what we were doing is wrong but some of it might be useful in the future so um amino acids amino acids as we know basically looking for amino acids is one of the key Target for for future Institute life detection missions um I'm going to talk more about the Practical side of astrobiology rather than the theory that we have heard before maybe we can get together after it and find some new solutions for the problems and situations that we've encountered during our experiments so there are three levels that we have to look at when dealing with amino acids the first is uh kind of a qualitative problem uh what type of amino acids can we detect and what do those tell us the second is the abundance of these amino acids so their ratios are they more similar to what things that we see here on Earth as the metabolic processes of microbes or something completely different and the third is basically what makes it a lot more interesting or puts the icing in the cake is the chirality as you well know amino acids are basically chiral meaning that they have uh they are they have two versions of the same molecule and they're non superimposable basically they are mirror images of each other they have exactly the same amount of atoms bonds but they have a totally different um um structure when we're talking about the isomers and getting to know the the ratio of these amino acids is basically like a Smoking Gun evidence for life if if you like um but what does it have to do with radiation well as you all know as we said here we are experiencing the effective radiation but in the early Universe the activity might have been a lot bigger than it is today and um there are all sorts of theories that are some of them are quite established some of their are some of them are in the process of proving but the point is that all the um um um sons and stars basically produce ultraviolet light and if you have this scattered from a surface basically you have a polarized light and basically um amino acids and enantiomers which are which absorb a specific light better than their counterparts then basically they get destroyed in the process this is the same way actually as we detect the the their ratio but it's also their Doom if we are talking about high intensities so this is a pretty much established model we can basically replicate these using all sorts of accelerators and all sorts of sources to basically mimic this effect the other one is is more of a still about photons but but more of a having a um the magnetic effect also um taken into account when dealing with how radiation affects these molecules and the third is basically stepping towards particles and subatomic particles and how they change the isotopic ratio and through the isotopic ratio how they change uh basically the composition of the amino acids and having them change a chirality so these are just the main theories that we know so far that work um and uh in our Laboratories we basically set out to mimic some of these effects uh the the accelerator atom queue we have three of them a small a middle one and a big one they are all considered small in the field of uh Nuclear Physics but for our experiments we basically um used a tandem accelerator which allows um a pretty quick change of ion sources so basically if you want to irradiate your sample with hydrogen and then you want to see how the same scent was affected by a heavier ion basically you can change the ions in a matter of hours or even less if you're if you're experienced so it has a lot versatility that's the point of having a tandem accelerator so um on the image you see probably the closest thing to a real lightsaber and what you see here on the image in the top right is basically how uh hydrogen ions look like when they are extracted to air from vacuum and basically this shows the ionization of the air that the accelerated ions are hitting so um I'm going to jump a bit to chemistry um and you will connect it later but the point is that um we we use the technical capillary electrophoresis to basically see what radiation might have to do with the with the molecules and their chirality um you see is really a very very friendly technique and it's very very simple but that's what people use that are basically saying who are expert in the field but the point is that you have a tiny capillary a tiny few silica capillary with an inner diameter let's say 50 microns and another in another diameter of let's say 400 microns and when you feel this capillary with an electrolyte then you and you apply voltage on this system basically you will see stuff migrate and they will migrate according to their higher Dynamic volume to charge ratio in this field so what it allows you to do it allows you to do to separate molecules based on the higher Dynamic volume to charge ratio and if you put a detector in uh the if you put a detector in the um uh at the specific point of the capillary basically you can see the molecules migrating through the capillary and the specific point you get intensity versus time so you you see migrating Peaks this simulation on the left would like to show that but unfortunately it doesn't run so you have to believe me that the Peaks you're seeing are actually migrating through the detector window that we're looking at and um it is using laser induced fluorescence well uh why are we using laser induced filter since the main reason is that to achieve High sensitivity it's you can imagine it like going or being in a dark room uh sleeping and you basically just um open up or or open your phone and you have a lot of bright light coming in even though if you're doing it in the broad daylight probably you're not affected that much it allows you to remove background basically have a great big signal and to do that you need some molecules that basically have a fluorescent property meaning that you're excited them over the specific wavelength and they respond to you with a different wavelength this is a a molecule that we used to do the conjugation of our amino acids to basically enhance the selectivity and enhance separation efficiency so in order to do CE what you have to do is you have to have molecules that have a net charge other than zero and we have to make them visible this molecule here does the two things at the same time so basically um what what you see here is uh the six centimeter from the die reacting with the Mi forming a stable uh amide conjugate and this way basically you uh if you if you separate them uh you're you're getting a pretty huge resolution so what we did is basically first developed the buffer system or background of that right the thing that you feel the capillary with to do this separation it's a pretty simple buffer it contains two components and the reason behind it was that we had to keep in mind the restrictions that a possible future Institute life detection Mission would have that you're not allowed to have a ton of regions you're not allowed to have all sorts of mixing to happen you have to make everything simple that was the mindset that we had when we were doing the experiments and as you see we've managed to separate actually 15 amino acids chirally of the 17 that we had in mind um why is it a promising technique like just like I said a sports review of moving Parts no power consumption uh easy to implement and it's just basically very very friendly technique and guys at JP are basically are developing this kind of technology and what you see here on the image is basically the base plate of this whole setup is basically the size of your laptop um so uh actually what we did during the year radiations well we made some sample holders from a drill press to kind of a modified drill press and we made 100 Micron thick pellets of uh racemic uh alanine and we irradiated them here you see the simulation how the protein bees would actually behave in the 100 Micron thick alanine pellet and as you see towards the end around 80 microns all the ions stop and this is actually where the most interesting things happen during an imbu analysis or or irradiation as well which you see here a bit a bit in more detail so we have the protons coming in the in the vacuum from the accelerator and then we have a window where the protons are extracted to the air and then as they enter the the amino acids they basically lose energy and the nice thing about the the ions is that that they give off all their almost all the energies right before they stop and this is actually why it's really useful during proton therapy and so we irradiated these samples with these energies to basically and we designed the system to basically stop all the ions in the sample and see how destruction or any alterations occur so moving forward basically you see that this is an expected electropherogram over D and L I mean erasmic as amino acid some of you might see that these are not exactly the same height and that is the same area this is just the control that we were using and we compared all our results to these control runs so basically you have two big Peaks and we are happy and if we go further uh we'll be interested more in the in the small Peak part of the uh of the electrophilograms as we go with the irradiation and as we go with the function of those increases so what you have here is basically the control that I just showed and different doses that have reached the sample and it's apparent that some of the Peaks are clearly increasing some of them show a nice correlation um and some of these Peaks are basically coming in duplets and this is what made us think that actually uh although we were irradiating wrestling alanine we are basically seeing racemic products um so we're still in the process of identifying these molecules um and in these radicals that we found but they seem to correlate well with the dose and also another interesting thing happened when we were looking at the big peaks of the uh amino acids and we were just wondering what could this mean what you see in the uh in this picture is basically as we go with the dose the the LD ratio is getting more and more hectic which means that we're not seeing uh it going towards one and anterior or the other but kind of mixed noisy version of the two as we go with those higher and higher so in summary basically we put together a simple setup and measured some radicals that could form due to radiation and we've done it in a chiral manner to basically see whether our method is capable of separating these chiral amino acids and more importantly if you think about the the next possible or the most possible places in our solar system but life could be um actually they are in a in a huge radiation environment so I think it is it is really necessary to basically create a library of radicals simulated here in the labs to basically make the work uh easier and the unload this from the scientists you will have to basically figure out how um molecules are formed in these high radiation environments and what they are seeing on the the results when these instruments send back the data so basically we're trying to to establish a big Library where all sorts of amino acids mixers and single ones are irradiated or with all sorts of radiation sources and see what products are there and what can be identified using this technology so I'd like to thank you very much for your attention foreign Chad hi uh Chad pazoriski from Georgia Tech uh I was really glad to see c elif uh because it's a method that I work with as well and so uh seeing it being used around is is wonderful and I have a question about your Cairo method which seemed to work very well um so uh did you develop this in its entirety or uh when did you develop it where basically I wanted all about the Cairo method um is it published and uh yeah uh it's not published yet but we've developed it uh in collaboration with JPL um basically the key thing here is that to do chiro separation the way you can imagine is is that when you have these molecules uh in the solution and that they migrate through the capillary if you have some additional additives in your buffer basically you can in um emphasize or or basically manipulate how these molecules behave but which I mean that if you have sugars like cyclins these are circular uh long oligomers basically these amino acids are as they migrate they meet with these cavities and they basically form an inclusion complex they go in they go out they go in they go out and some of the Indian tumors are staying longer in this cavity and some of them are staying for a short period of time and as they migrate they basically separate and this is what we see and and in this context to basically answer your question um we had a lot of constraints first of all we are not allowed to have a ton of additives a ton of stuff in the buffer because an instrument has to be able to do this on its own its own so we had two components in it which is the happish or hippies I don't know how they say it in English properly AGP yes and and the other one is the md40 which is basically similar to cyclodextrins but it consists of sugar oligomers or actually monomers and as you go you have at the end at the beginning one sugar one glucose unit and as you go two three four Etc and these after some around seven they start to become helico and you have a long long longer chains of these sugars and basically it enhanced the effectiveness of this cavity movement thanks okay last question hi my name is shiv agrawal from Western Michigan University so you have used protons for radiation have you considered using leptons and not yet uh we know it should be done and it should be interesting but we wanted to do to use the facility that we have available um and currently we are only only able only able to do um protons and heavy ions um it would be a nice thing to move forward and do all sorts of experiment on this on this field as well I'm happy to collaborate second thing is uh have you used variable energies for protons at what energies are you we in this experiment we used only one energy we didn't want to have too many variables if it's hard enough to figure out whether with a hundred Micron thickness of a pallet are we able to do robustly uh do experiments and unfortunately with a simple system and with a great care we were able to basically make it uh work uh so this was the first goal that we wanted to achieve and and uh of course we have all sorts of experiments either already running or in plan to vary energies where I actually the the dose rate which is actually a much more important thing it looks like it is a key factor in some uh um instances and also doing everything in vacuum doing everything it was in air but we also would like to do it in vacuum and also in cold temperatures as well thanks a lot all right thank you very much mate thanks very much [Music]
