hello [Music] pleasure to be here uh so I'm in the program in Applied Mathematics at the University of Arizona but I work with Professor Regis farrier who's an ecologist and a postdoc antenna affolder who is also an ecologist and planetary scientist so we developed these Global models of Europa and so what you see right here is the Europa Clipper Mission which is going to launch next year in October hopefully and I believe it's the largest in terms of size spacecraft that NASA's ever built because of those massive solar panels um because we're when we're five times away from the Sun at Jupiter I think the brightness scales like inverse Square law so 25 times less bright at that area so why do we care about Europa so beneath the ice crust we have an ocean which potentially contains two to three times the amount of water as on Earth which is when I first discovered that fact I was just so blown away by that um and we have an energy source from tidal heating uh namely we may have hydrothermal venting as a result of that we saw that on Enceladus because we saw silicates in the plumes we haven't confirmed that yet in Europa but it's very likely based on the amount of tidal energy that we expect and we also have a rock ocean interface so that's very essential for you know cycling chemicals needed for life uh and we have a lot of convection as Sarah talked about um which is very essential also for those energy gradients so as a result we need these models to constrain what we're going to see from the mission so we had juice also the esa Mission let's not forget about that um so we need to model all these different layers um so working off what we did for install it is to analyze the Cassini data we're going to do that here specifically focusing on the ecosystem aspect um and so what we want to do with that is provide clear constraints on what kind of BIOS Industries we're going to expect based on a number of different hypotheses uh of abiotic possibilities biotic possibilities and have real possibilities without life so as I said our approach is very multi level uh we are going to first look at the bottom layer which is the mixing of the core and the ocean to assess you know the chemical structure coming out of you know coming out through through the water passing through the core and what chemicals are going to come through that we're going to have to assess what how that mixes in the water to assess how much uh chemicals we're going to see coming out of the plumes and then we also need to take some model organisms from Earth to understand the metabolisms that we might expect along with the ecological and possible evolutionary dynamics of the life that we're modeling so with this framework we're going to estimate the likelihoods of certain data sets that we're going to see via a Bayesian framework so to intimidate you a little bit we're going to have some math um so let's talk about the mixing we look at the dimensionless mixing ratio X and the temperature T so we have a partial differential equation which with spatial and time variables solving this partial differential equation gives us this steady state composition and temperature of the mixing layer with the mass flux density so using that information we can compute what we're going to see coming out of the plumes by integrating over the entire space so we we integrate the integrand contains this Mass flux density and the concentration of a specific chemical component that we're looking at so whether that be a glycine or other amino acids or you know cells potentially so the concentration of this compound at the base of the ocean plume assuming that the buoyant mixing layer mixes together as we described from the previous model is given by this quotient of these integrals so then we want to look at the cell metabolism and output and there's a very large variety of possibilities we could be working with here so we kind of run the model for tons and tons of possibilities of Earth analogs um depending on these environmental conditions so we model this catabolic reaction rate of a specific organism using the Arrhenius law I know that came up yesterday Arrhenius in one of the trivia questions um uh so and that's so the Arrhenius law is specifically this quotient here and we use the catabolic energy constant for given by this term and it goes in here to understand the ratio of inactivated to activated enzymes for the reaction now critically we assess the ecological dynamics of the system so in this case we are dealing with one population which is given by a standard ode model describing the Dynamics but we've been thinking about incorporating multi species into this because there's actually a significant dynamical difference when you have competition between species in the environment and that would seriously affect what we'll see when we go there so we have to we have to have multiple different ecosystem Dynamics models and so we solve this and get a steady state concentration of a specific uh compound from this so what can we learn from specifically the Europa Clipper Mission so the Europa Clipper Mission has some very interesting instruments we have a mapping Imaging spectrometer so it will map the surface and conduct the spectroscopy of the surface and the distribution of the Organics so as things come out of the plumes they they fall onto the surface and we should expect to see an interesting chemical composition I know they're already doing this with jwst from the from a distance they haven't analyzed that data yet but uh should be interesting and then to sort of sniff the exosphere of Europa we have a mass spectrometer Mass specs it'll determine the the composition of the of the ocean beneath by sniffing that exosphere and then we have a surface dust analyzer uh it'll have it'll measure like the solid particles coming out and so in this image you can see kind of a remote identification of NaCl via spectroscopy so let's focus on this slide a little bit so this is the overall framework so at the top we have those mechanistic models for the geochemistry and the biology that we discussed earlier and so the flow of information goes from the top as prior probability probability densities that flow into as parameters into the general model then we pass those parameters into the biological model for physiology and evolution which then goes to our habitability Criterion so the habitability Criterion that we generally use here is it's a differential equation describing the population so essentially if I were to take an Earth like organism drop it onto Europa would the change in the population be positive or would it be zero so the derivative of population growth essentially and so we pass that into Bayes theorem as prior distributions the posterior distributions uh come from these uh so we okay actually to be more specific we simulate all of these models with thousands of data points to get what we call pseudo data in what's called an approximate Bayesian computation and so we pass that into the model and we take the observational data and we put that into base theorem so if any of you are aware of Bayes theorem that is a way of assessing the probability of a certain event given prior information and given posterior information um and so now we have this cycle of information so after we get a probability from base theorem we can pass it back into the geophysical parameters model and then continue to constrain as we get more observational data so here's an example of how we did that with Enceladus for Cassini so in this graph here you can see the blue dots are simulations for uninhabitable parameter space the orange dots are uninhabited but habitable and the green dots are habitable and habited so what you can see uh from analyzing the methane content of the plume and Cassini using this framework was that the vast majority of simulations for all the possibilities we assessed fall under the biotic category um which is pretty exciting because I mean that speaks for itself right so um but there's a very important constraint on this namely the probability of abiogenesis so what we do in this model is assess all the possibilities from probability zero to probability one of abiogenesis and so what we found was at a pretty low probability of abiogenesis uh the from the previous slide um with a low probability of a biogenesis you see that biotic explanations are the most probable for what we're seeing the in the methane content so we really need to develop our models of abiogenesis to really limit limit this variable and constrain this probability so the conclusion is in order to find life we really have to model these planetary systems with the assumption that there could be life there already because if we don't we're going to show up there and we're going to think okay it's habitable but why because potentially the habitability of a planet is actually coming from the life is already there so we have to incorporate that into our into our potential models so this will allow us to really enhance Mission data analysis um beforehand uh so you know with when we had Cassini we showed up there and we had no idea what was going on we're like wild plumes this is amazing um but it took many many years to really assess this so hopefully with Europa Clipper we have this framework in hand as a software package so the data can be fed through real time and the benefit of this is then we can narrow down in on specific areas of Europa that are of interest to us and really maximize the scientific yield of these missions so without take questions and thank you uh nice talk uh two questions maybe the first did you choose a prior for a biogenesis yeah so we sampled the entire space from zero to one probability in that in those 10 000 or so simulations so basically um we can't pick a prior for abiogenesis there's no constraint on that variable uh so essentially we have to run the model for all possibilities of abiogenesis so so like I said specifically with the Enceladus data we found that uh much less than 50 percent chance abiogenesis ensures that the biotic explanation is the most probable explanation I believe is around 30 or less probability but if you're beneath that threshold then really the abiotic explanations are way more probable even though the samples from the abiotic simulations are much smaller but you know when the probability of evangelists is really low it's just not going to happen right so okay yeah that answered my second question yeah that's so different great hey thank you for your talk so for Europa are you also in terms of metabolism are you thinking about methanogenesis or yeah okay so that was the first step to consider um infer Enceladus it was kind of a the most obvious thing to look at because of the methane content um with Europa it's more complex uh because we don't have any real data from Europa and also the environments on Europa are much more varied you have subsurface pockets of water along with the ocean and maybe you have like biofilms on the bottom of the eye so it's it's a much more complex thing um so my hope is to uh run all the simulations for all the possible hypotheses that exist currently okay and I have one little follow up question so you very briefly talked about Dynamic communities and you mentioned competition are you just looking at competition or are you looking at other sorts of consortiums like in a biofilm there's competition but there's also lots of sharing going on right so um if we're including multi species in our models we're hoping to incorporate all the possible interactions between these species um which is really critical I want to re re uh iterate because you know the competition can kill off like all of the life you know so we need to sort of have an evolutionary perspective also and not just like a real time ecological perspective to assess these things um so really good question thank you very quick questions hi Emily bear Stanford University I was wondering so in the biological part of the model what kind of data goes into that and how can environmental microbiologists help modelers improve their models what kind of data do you need for that right so we need Earth analogs primarily we need the you know catabolic reaction parameters for specific Earth analog so you know we might want to go to Antarctica and see what's going on there and that's our best that's our best way to constrain it at the moment so that's how I think biologists really should really help us in that way yeah exactly thank you so much for your thoughts thank you [Music]
