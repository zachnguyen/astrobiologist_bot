what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind this one it's so cool okay so Europa surface is incredibly young and we can tell that just because there aren't many craters on it and we generally use the rule of thumb like more craters equals older surface and and there is a quantitative relationship between that so we have estimated the age of Europa surface to be between like 50 and 180 million years old which means that there are dinosaurs and it might even be a majority of dinosaurs of their fossils that are older than europa's surface not that they ever looked at Europa but there are some bones that are older than Europa and that that really blows my mind of putting all of the solar systems history into context
