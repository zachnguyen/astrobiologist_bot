[Music] hello as Miguel said um my name is Marshall and I'm an NPP fellow at JPL Caltech and I work with Morgan cable and Brianna Henderson and I do most of my experimental work at Caltech and Paul asimov's lab but because this is a conference of literally graduate students and postdocs I wanted to talk about the planetary science summer school program which is a program for graduate students and postdocs to teach you all how to help Mission design for planetary missions actually happens and to learn the process and so I'm going to be presenting the mission that my team and I developed during the PSS in which the majority of the framework for the mission was developed back in 2021 and that we iterated on since then the astrobiology exploration at Enceladus or X for short and I'm going to preface this by saying that this is an Unholy amount of information to distill into a dozen slides and so uh I did my best unfortunately I can't go into a lot of detail with these slides but if you have any questions about the science ask a question if you don't want to ask a question come find me I'd love to be stoked to talk about this stuff Okay so I'm sure you guys are familiar with Enceladus at this point um but that thing is in Solace it's one of uh Saturn's moons and it's it's relatively pretty small it's only about 500 uh kilometers in diameter but there's some super cool stuff going on even though it's it's this tiny little thing that stuff coming out of the bottom of Enceladus um is a continuous plume that's formed over the South polar Terrain and so if we zoom in a little bit closer these are images from Cassini and though it's not actually blue like that that's in false color but that's just to show you where these um fractures are and the plume is sourced from those fractures um that all combines to form a continuous plume over the South polar terrain and we have really strong evidence from some of the measurements by Cassini that this plume is directly sourced from a subsurface Global liquid water ocean and so this presents a unique opportunity we're unique in our solar system to sample the contents of a subsurface ocean in situ using uh multi flyby or an Orbiter Mission architecture and we have some rough compositional information of the plume uh from Cassini using the inms or the ion and neutral Mass spectrometer and the cosmic dust analyzer and so um in the plume gas we see water um small hydrocarbons some simple and complex Organics and this is a paper from the weight at all paper back in 2006 from the inms data but if we look at plume grains we see that they're waterized but um we see a lot of different salts but in addition to that and I I think a previous talk hit on this a little bit we see silicon Nano grains and that's really important because based on what we know the only way that these silicon nanoparticles could be produced within this size range are high temperature hydrothermal reactions and that's huge from a habitability standpoint and in addition to this looking at the CDA data that Cosmic dust analyzer we see evidence not direct detection because of the the instrumental capabilities we had at the time this is like 80s technology but we see strong evidence for macromolecular organic compounds and so there's this complex organic chemistry going on that we don't really understand and we don't know what's going on there but like something's happening and so we need to figure out what's up and so with that being said we have liquid water we have a geothermal source of feed via the high temperature hydrothermal reactions [Music] um essentially all the chemical building blocks for Life as we know it they're present um sulfur hasn't been published yet but it has been detected in the greens it should be published in the next year or so so with all of this in mind could Enceladus Harbor life we thought it would be sick to develop a mission concept that would be capable of finding out and so just a brief overview of our mission architecture it's be it multiply by Mission but you're orbiting Saturn and do multiple flybysmen zeldas and we would require 30 flybys for our science and would launch in 2033 and after a nine year cruise phase and a one year pump down phase we would enter four years of science operations where we would directly search for biosignatures through n situ chemical compositional analysis of the plume and contextualize these in situ measurement in situ measurements through a synergistic combination of geophysical and geomorphological investigations aimed at also assessing the habitability of Enceladus over geologic time and we would do this using a mass spectrometer a high resolution camera and just a high gain antenna so three it well two and a half instruments because the antenna you use for radio communications and so just briefly to talk about how before I dive into the science objectives how these objectives were formulated um NASA doesn't like as much when people just when they're developing missions to like take this instrument okay we have a sick instrument what kind of science can we do with it instead um we were taught and we were informed that NASA prefers that you first start by answering or by asking questions like what do we not know about Enceladus what do we need to know to ask more questions and so that's what we started by doing and if you do that if you start from the science questions and what you're interested in and what you want to find out the rest of it follows pretty logically and so say we want to find out this thing okay what do we need to measure to figure that thing out okay then you have your measurement requirements and then at what levels do we need to measure this there you have like further established measurement requirements well how do we make these measurements and then you select your instruments and then so on and so forth and so it just logically flows from it's called left to right approach and so I'll talk a little bit about our science objectives of course the first which is to determine if the molecular and isotopic distributions uh within the plume are a result of biological activity or abiotic chemical processing and we would do this just with your usual suspects amino acids fatty acids and plume grains and um by assessing isotopic fractionation in um in the plume gas and we would do this just using a mass spectrometer and if you have any questions about Mass specs or instrument selection please ask a question or find me later I'd love to talk about that and the second of our objectives is to determine whether Enceladus is in thermal equilibrium and is therefore capable of sustaining an ocean over geologic time scales and this is essentially just a heat balance equation we want to know how much being how much heat is being input to Enceladus through tidal dissipation from Saturn and how much heat is being emitted by Enceladus through like um conductive heat loss and you can actually determine the heat being generated um within Enceladus by uh looking at tidal dissipation from Saturn and you can do this using orbital migration rates so you could look at where Enceladus is at in its orbital phase relative to What was seen by Cassini to see how the orbital migration happens and uh from that you could calculate a tidal dissipation quality factor and you can determine the heat being emitted by measuring ice shell thickness which is a proxy for the heat loss and you can do that using a gravity science measurements the third of our objective objectives is looking at plume formation mechanisms to determine whether the plume material is being delivered to the surface via open crevice boiling or explosive cryovolcanic like eruptions and we expect there to be differences in the morphology of the vents at the surface that are expressed in each scenario and you could actually sort of tease out how these plumes are being formed by high resolution imaging of the vents so for an open crevice model we expect there to be vent width variations in response to Tidal forcing throughout enceladus's orbital phase and for an open crevice model we expect these vent width variations to be consistent along the strike of the vent and so by taking multiple high resolution images of a single vent throughout enceladus's orbital phase and looking at vent width variations we can determine if that were the case whereas for a purely cryovolcanic eruptive model we expect these vent width variations to be restricted to the immediate vicinity of the vent and so we could sort of tease out the relative contribution of each of these models to plume formation and then our fourth and final science objective is to determine if the geologic activity that uh is modifying the South polar terrain like we see in all those awesome images if it's influenced other regions in the past over geologic time we would do this by looking at two things both crater infilling and elliptical crater orientations because if you look at the depth diameter ratios of craters around the South polar terrain they're pretty shallow compared to the rest of the the crater population because of all that plume Fallout that's infilling the craters and so we see really shallow craters around there but if you look at the global crater population like typically um they have a pretty well defined depth diameter ratio and so if we were to look at survey the global crater population and find an area around Enceladus where we see anomalously infilled craters that could be evidence that there was past plume activity and another thing that we would look at uh are elliptical crater orientations to see if there could have been any eye shell reorientation in the past because given a preferential velocity vector and the impactor population and a small enough impact angle below about 15 degrees elliptical craters are formed and so like given a preferential velocity Vector we expect to see mostly East West um uh oriented elliptical craters and so if we were to survey the crater population and see a shift in the orientation of these elliptical craters that is like relatively consistent we could infer past eye shell reorientation from that and so for the mission trajectory um briefly we'd use a Venus Earth Earth Venus Earth Earth Earth Jupiter gravity assist where we would do we do a a slingshot around Venus and then a couple orbits around Earth and then slingshot out to the Jupiter system and then use Jupiter's gravity to slingshot out into the Saturn system but getting out to Saturn isn't a problem it's slowing down that's the problem because you're going like 15 20 kilometers a second and so after Saturn orbital insertion we do a one year pump down phase and using multiple use multiple flybys of Titan using Titan's gravity to reduce the spacecraft velocity and tailor the inclination and altitude such that we could Target and sell at us properly for our flybys and then after that enter a four year tour phase where we would conduct all of our science operations that would consist of 30 flybys at least and this is this uh requirement is driven primarily by our gravity science measurements that we need to make and the surface mapping would require a total of 22 flybys not necessarily 22 flybys total dedicated surface mapping but the data downlink would require 22 flybys um and so a minimum of five flybys at low altitudes as well for event imagery and Institute Bloom analyzes so keyword to key takeaway uh installed is a sick it's super awesome there's a lot of really cool stuff going on there and we would see what's going on there by looking at plume composition heat balance the different event formation mechanisms and what the surface of Enceladus can tell us about its past and this is important because in the most recent decadal survey they specifically call out a New Frontiers mission to Enceladus using a multi flyby mission architecture and so there's so many outstanding questions that we just we just don't know about what's going on in Enceladus and we need to go back to figure out what's going on so as promised a little talk about PSS this is my team that I worked with and they're the most absurdly brilliant group of people that I've ever had the pleasure of working with um they're incredible I'm still friends with many of them now um and so I I'd like to talk a little bit about the PSS um it's uh it's not really as much of a summer school as it is a rigorous Mission design program where they teach you how to actually formulate a mission um and the deadlines pass for this year but it's it's it's competitive you have to apply for it and they take 18 people per cohort um but you get to work with literally the best in the business um you're mentored by people that are on like Europa Clipper Mars sample return all that kind of stuff and in the last week you get to work one on one and are mentored by a member of NASA's uh Advanced project design team uh TMax they're literally the best at what they do formulating missions and you've learned so much and it's incredible um if you have any questions please come find me ask here or if you don't want to ask a question in front of a bunch of people come find me talk to me um I knew when I first like was thinking about doing it I was like oh my God I don't know anything about Mission design how am I going to do this but everybody else in my court thought the exact same thing so you don't need to be an expert in Mission design you just need to be interested and enthusiastic about doing this stuff and this is the the most incredible experience I've had of my professional career so I would highly highly recommend this program to anybody interested in Mission design thank you any questions hi Michael I'm from UCSD just up the hill um I was wondering is there like how quickly or is it plooming like is it gonna run out of water nice um oh it's been active for I mean Enceladus is anywhere between like 100 million and over one two billion years old um and it's been like the e ring around Saturn is composed mostly of Enceladus plume materials so we know it's been around for a very very long time and we also know that the ocean is is a quite large um and makes up a pretty significant portion of the the mass of the Moon so I I there's a not any evidence as far as I'm concerned or as far as I know uh that it's running out anytime soon and we believe it's it's still active I'm curious um does this program kind of have a component where you assess the costs of certain missions and sort of optimize for that because that have a component that's the it's like the entire last week is like the so the New Frontiers five cost cap is 900 million and it takes like 700 million to take a piece of cardboard to Enceladus and so and so yeah that's a huge part of it and that's like a huge part of like working with TMax is to try and do rapid iterations of your your mission concept to see what you can do and what trade space you can explore to fall with under the cost cap because the problem isn't like finding all the science to do because like there's so much science you can do it's finding what it's doing the most science for the least money and so unfortunately that is a massive part of mission design and formulation thank you hi uh Colin Robinson uh very man University I I was just wondering uh I know one of the big hindrances to uh sampling Organics from blooms and Enceladus is uh destruction of Organics because in the sampling processes right because of velocity and you just go you know at high speeds through the bloom with like a cup to pick up all that stuff lots of Organics are just gonna be obliterated so what steps were you guys thinking of taking to eliminate destruction of Bio signatures thank you so much for asking that question um I actually that's the research that I'm doing at Caltech is we're simulating hyper velocity impacts of eye screens um using impact ionization mass spectrometry and we're the only lab in the world that can do that at the moment they can actually simulate a distribution of I well I don't want to get i'll nerd out too much come find me to talk about that after after this if you want but to answer your question yes there is a velocity regime where you have both efficient ionization assuming you're using an impact ionization Mass spectrometer for analysis of plume grains which is pretty necessary at this stage yes there is a velocity regime that you have efficient ionization and molecular survivability for a range of of compound classes and the survivability velocity range um is depends on molecular functionality but it's somewhere between four and six kilometers per second it is like the Goldilocks zone that you wanna that you want to sample at so yes that's a fantastic question and that is a problem that a lot of very smart people are trying to solve right now in in terms of that speed four to six kilometers per second uh is that fast enough to be able to stay out of the gravitational pull of Enceladus okay yeah Enceladus does it there's not very much gravity there exactly that's tiny yeah thank you no problem uh hi I'm over for Veronica from Cornell um but whether it's like a open for fracture for purposes uh cryova volcanism is that going to um impact the types of uh biosis signatures that uh could be detected yes very much so that's a fantastic question um in each case um the mechanism of plume formation that's under underlying the surface um I'm trying to think of the best way to say it but the way the grains are formed actually strongly influences the composition of the grains because you have homogeneous nucleation where if you just have like water that just freezes and is is shot out in the like the open crevice boiling situation um where you have uh a heterogeneous nucleation where you have well I don't want to get too much in the weeds but but uh yes um for a an explosive cryovolcanic scenario like you mentioned um we wouldn't see very many um compositional differences from grain to grain whereas for the open crevice boiling scenario due to the different ice cream nucleation processes that that can occur you would see very distinct compositional differences in the grains and we see that in the CDA data that's where all those the [Music] um evidence for those Organics that I was talking about before those complex Organics that comes from Ice grains that are composed primarily of an organic phase that were formed very likely through open crevice boiling and so um I guess that's a long answer to saying yes that it very much matters that's why we want to find out okay our lunch delivery is running a little late so we have time for another question if sometimes someone has thanks Marshall I've heard this talk many times you're welcome and every time and every time it's enjoyable and every time I feel like I ask the question about uh what kind of mass spectrometer are you going to include what kind of resolution or msms capabilities do you need to detect bioseignatures get isotopic information get through matrices of the salt grains crystals thank you you gave me an excuse to talk about that now um so for for the the gas the plume gas you need some sort of like uh qitms or like Mass specs type instrument that I'm sure you're familiar with that stuff um but where you need to be able to like have a sample Inlet where you take gas in and then you you determine the the composition of that and that's really necessary for uh assessing isotopic fractionation um because those typically have very high mass resolution which you need for looking at different isotope logs and things whereas for the plume grains um a lot of dust detectors don't have the same mass resolution um just due to the the way the instruments are designed and but you need information about the ice cream composition because of all the cool stuff is in the grains and the lower the bigger the grains are the lower the velocity the or the lower the altitude uh the more interesting the grin composition is and so you need in theory you could just use one to answer your question like a mass specs type instrument um where when I for those people that don't know Mass specs is an acronym for the mass spectrometer for planetary expert well enter export yes Mass Spectrum for Planetary Exploration that's going to be going on Europa clipper um but that can do grains but those sort of instruments have issues with some of the more refractory Organics and some inorganic species and so what you really need to be able to do this given that you have enough cost margin is you need a dust detector or a grain like some sort of impact ionization Mass spectrometer that can utilize these hyper velocity impacts as an ionization source to determine ice grain composition and also something where you can assess the composition of the plume gas as well thanks missions um so there are if I go back to a couple of slides um so it's in eccentric orbit the various intric orbit around Saturn and so if you look at I don't know can you see the the curse okay yeah you can right here see that little Green Dot um that's where the their every orbit you do like a small burn where you use a little bit of fuel to make sure that you stay uh in the orbit that you need to actually do these measurements and so it's not as huge of a deal and doesn't require like a ton of Delta V or like change in velocity of the spacecraft um but no that is something to consider and though you're you're right and that is something that we took into account when doing all these uh the orbital calculations uh so the that's before we actually start science operations um because upon Saturn orbital insertion um we're going too fast um and the the spacecraft the inclination altitude geometry things like that aren't suitable to immediately enter science operations to start doing targeted Enceladus flybys and so we need to use Titan's gravity to further slow down so we can get within that goldilock zone that we talked about before for sampling foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music]
