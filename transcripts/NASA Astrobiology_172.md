[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] friends fellow earthlings and the results of billions of years of evolution on one small rock in the void this is ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life I'm your host Dr Graham the cosmo biologist Lao and as and as always we're brought to you by the NASA astrobiology program and segnet.org thank you so much for everyone for tuning in today as always we'd love to give a huge shout out to those of you out there engaging in conversation with me with our guests through the post on the NASA Astro bio Twitter account uh and for just sharing about our episodes and all the things that we're doing this month we want to give a special shout out to Dr Francis Rivera Hernandez for sharing about the show Dr Hernandez was a guest on the show previously for episode 38 20 episodes ago she joined us along with Kendall Lynch and Svetlana scoliar to talk about the perseverance Rover and the geology of Mars and what we're looking at and trying to understand if Mars ever had life or currently has life and what we might find there but now with today's episode of ask an astrobiologist we're going to embark on a journey into the past for life on Earth As Told in the tapestry of the signs that remain in the Rock record we'll be diving into the ancient idiocran period a pivotal chapter in Earth's history that witnessed the awe inspiring rise of animal phyla and a lot of experiments in evolution in biology an extraordinary biodiversity was occurring leading to what we currently see here on Earth now today's guest is a paleontologist and an expert on the edocrine period the range that living things existed in during the Ed octane was around 635 to 539 million years ago at a time when animal life as we know it was Rising onto this planet Dr Mary droser is a distinguished professor in the department of Earth and planetary Sciences at the University of California Riverside and someone who has dedicated her career to unraveling the mysteries of the ediacaran period her groundbreaking discoveries and meticulous studies of fossil assemblages have shed light on the early evolution of multicellular life Dr duracer's expertise has taken her to fascinating field sites around the world including her own work in helping us to develop the South Australia's nilpina idiacaran national park today she joins us to share her invaluable insight and take us on a captivating Journey Through Time as well as her own career so Dr Mary droser welcome to ask an astrobiologist great thanks for having me one thing I love to ask our guests when they first join us is to share with us their science or origin story the thing that inspired them to to pursue a career in The Sciences in the Realms of paleontology and other disciplines related to astrobiology what was it that that hooked you into a career in The Sciences oh I was very young when I got interested in the Sciences when I was um a little kid and like five years old wanted to be a marine biologist because of just floating around in the shallow Seas off off Long Island and then age 10 I sort of got interested in geology um and it's a boring history the rest is history combining marine biology with geology and paleontology and I I was a freshman geology major which is not usual most people discovered geology during college so yeah very early on love science I love that so much I mean for me myself and I first started college I had no idea I'd be a geologist eventually I wanted to do marine biology and some other things and then just found geology along the way I think that's the case for for many of us so what in your career then took you into this realm of paleontology and specifically studying the idiacarin I I got into sort of interested in in how animals interact with sediments and interact with their environments and that got me into sort of this this world of looking at bioterbation and burrowing and Mobility um and I just kept going deeper and deeper in time my my dissertation was looking at sort of the Advent of mobility and and when and how animals first started moving and changing the sediment um and it just kept getting deeper um and eventually in the ediacron where Mobility first originated um and so uh that's I've never left I love that well I mean life has certainly left since that period and moved on and done a bunch of other interesting things and you know life on our planet we have good evidence maybe 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago some of us hypothesized maybe four billion years or even earlier uh life was happening on Earth but you know much of our our lifespan of the time of life on Earth was microbial life we had a lot of evolutionary change and adaptation we have the rise of oxygen thanks to life but it really was during this this period you know it's that that life kind of started really blossoming out into this more complex multicellular the organisms that we kind of know of today why do you think really drove that that complex Behavior to drive this this process forward to allow life to kind of emerge in that realm right well that is a big question right you need two things you need the environment to be correct and you need the genes you need the genetic Pathways for multicellularity and there are a lot of people looking at the Advent of multicellularity from biological and paleontological many perspectives um so there's two two ways in which we think this might have happened and and most diverse history has gone by before we get multicellular animals and um multicellular multicellularity arose in a lot of different unrelated clades many times but in terms of animals it is a question of did we have the genes and we needed the right level of oxygen and we didn't have that until the ediacran um is one of the sort of leading hypotheses that it all comes down to to oxygen we need oxygen um so that is what we we think may have uh have been that last last push for multicellularity and in animals anyway so we did ask our audience online we gave a little poll about some creatures of ediacarin period um and ask them which creature you know the images we shared wasn't from the ediacarin and it's an interesting image so three of those are actual artists Renditions of the kinds of fossils that you've discovered uh looking into this period of time one of them was an artist drawing of the Facehugger from the alien franchise of Science Fiction and interestingly we actually fooled about 20 of the respondents did not know which was which and so there were some really interesting things going on during the where we had different you know kinds of uh adaptations they're different different kinds of things that life was doing how do you kind of Envision what life was actually doing at that time these new experiments that biology was up to yeah so I my my yeah my fantasy world is getting in Miss frizzle's Magic School Bus and going back to the EDI Akron um and I so I you know when I think about the IDI Akron or when I try to describe the ediacron the first thing I do is talk about the sea floor so the sea floor of the idiacron there were no borrowers you know going deep down we had Mobility but nobody really churning the sediment we didn't have the effective grazers that we have today things like cucumbers and whatnot and so the sea floor would have been covered with like goose and I mean the kind of thing you would never want to put your foot in right think Pond scum so when you start to Envision the ediacran marine environment and we're in the ocean of course first you start with your sea floor in the sort of green and blue and brown and disgusting sort of microbial mats and organic mattes on the seafloor and then put on that um organisms so what we think actually you imagine people think oh were they rare and little tiny little things here and there no neither rare nor small big and small so you start with that seafloor and you put frond like organisms that were as tall as I am you put some things that looked like bath mats that could be you know a meter long that would roam along the sea floor and you know lots of groups of organisms that would have just sitting there like little buttons on the sea floor and so if you were snorkeling around in the ediacron you'd be like all right this looks like an alien world it looks like something that somebody created um for some alien movie that takes place under the sea um that's kind of familiar but isn't really familiar um and so what we're trying to do is do the Deep dive no pun intended into figuring out what is there and how do they relate to life today um but it totally would have been an alien world and they're not familiar and when we show people The Fosters they're like yeah no I have no idea what this is um so yeah I'm not surprised that um it was 20 they are weird looking things yeah and I think if anything it was more that people saw the Facehugger and they knew that from Alien rather than knowing that the others weren't actually you know artist Renditions of some science fiction creature um now I have read of you that you you've had the opportunity to name a few of these fossil creatures that you've discovered including one that you named after your own mother uh one that you named after David Attenborough um what's he feel like to have like these these fossil creatures that we know of on Earth that you had a chance to actually give them the name and kind of share that with the world um it's crazy and exciting right so we've named I think 10 or 12 different organisms what's amazing right is is that um these are whole new body plans this isn't just a little tweak on something we've already known these are new body plans and and the way in which and sort of why we've discovered so many is that we're not doing paleontology the way others do Paleo so and liking it like normal paleontologists like the clink clink method you go out in the field you're like clink clink clink clink clink you take the fossil back to the museum um where we're working at what is now Neil Pina ediacra National Park we are able to excavate whole betting planes that represent snapshots of the idioacrancy floor so if you imagine you know going out to the sea floor today and a storm coming and dumping a bunch of sand on the sea floor and that sand becoming Rock and casting those organisms on the base we're Excavating these beds turning them over and literally have snapshots of the seafloor so what we're doing is we're mapping these beds and we're finding all sorts of new and and different body plans that are unlike other things so that's where it gets really weird you're like I have no idea what this is and we give them nicknames that are sort of what they look like so aten varieties look like a raisin so when we first saw it we'd be like oh here's a raisin you know and in my logbook it says raisin and then we found a bed that was covered with them and we're like all right we have to deal with this and and you know by by looking at it and doing all sorts of like looking at the preservation and the nature of morphology and everything we reconstruct it as not to take the analogy too far but as as sort of a grape like organism or a sort of Tina four like organism and so that's what's fun it's amazing it's a privilege to be able to look at these new body plans um and so yeah it's totally crazy um and exciting and trying to figure out where they fit in terms of the Tree of Life um I have a lot of wrinkles from just that so yeah I mean there's a lot to uncover there you know from those early Tina fours and sponges and then kind of coming up to where we're at in the adiac around you mentioned uh no Pina ediacra National Park which was uh created in 2021 and you've had a hand in development of the park itself um can you speak to the importance of that site um in general not just for understanding this fossil assemblage but also that site in general and why it's such a compelling region yeah so we um you know I started working there about 20 years ago with my colleague Jim galing at the South Australia Museum we knew about five probably two or three years in that this was a special special site um and so over the last 15 years and very much so over the last seven or eight years we've worked with the South Australian government the um pastoralist who owned the property the traditional landowners the Adnan matna to come together to recognize that this is a um a unique site and it's it's a site where um you know people can walk around both to bring science to the community which I think is hugely important as well as to conserve and preserve the fossils so it's a wonderful opportunity to have kids and adults and you know come and learn about fossils and learn that Earth has a history and that going back in time can can teach just about the future is important to understanding our life is important to understanding you know how we might look at life on another planet and uh Neil pianidiakra National Park and and the ediacra fossils there um are also part of a world heritage bed that we're doing for the region which is sort of the dawn of animal life which will take it from early eukaryotes into the Cambrian um and sort of when we have skeletonization and predation and things like that so we're looking at this you know hundreds a couple hundreds of millions of years period where we can track the crazy environmental changes which form the backdrop of all of this as well as these appearance of these evolutionary Innovations and so it's it's an astounding place um it is nearby is the gssp or Global strata type point for the ediacran literally there's a golden spike in there and so it's a it's an amazing site and I think just bringing science to the public and obviously for this particular Community it's also an economic help um which is not a bad thing so that's awesome well I want to share a quote that we had from you uh in a NASA astrobiology article that simply put this is the best record of the dawn of animal life on Earth uh looking in this nopina site um I'd like to connect us to astrobiology though how does this kind of impact our view of how life might change and evolve over time on other worlds yeah so I think you know I'm I'm I'm sort of at the tail end of what's interesting right when we think about astrobiology we think in terms of teeny tiny prokaryotes microorganisms and by the time you get to multicellularity you're like whoa you know major Innovations have already happened but I think what we're there are a couple things we're doing that I think that is important one looking at sort of rate and scale of evolutionary change and Innovations you know this these what we see in Alpena and the diversity and the biomass that comes along very quickly once conditions are right so that's a really important insight into understanding how life might evolve if the conditions are right it's just going to go and it's not gonna you know it's not rare um there it's diverse they do a lot of different things and I think that's one really important aspect what are the biological physical and chemical processes that get us to that point and those are the kinds of things we're trying to to get get a handle on we're also looking at aspects of um sort of what does life do to the record so the record of sediments that preserve these so one of the things we're interested in is I mentioned um you know the the sort of widespread microbial mats and when you have widespread microbial mats that changes the nature of how sediments are packaged and so we are currently looking at how we can recognize that from a cross section and recognize just without seeing a microbial matter even the texture it is but from the cross section of looking at the side view of sedimentary rocks um how we might recognize that life was there um and we knew that there were certain structures that microbial mats imparted on sedimentary rocks um and that that would be a mechanism for looking at life on other planets but one of my graduate students Rachel soprenic came in my office and said I think we could do this through machine learning um that has led to us now developing you know um we've published a couple papers on this machine learning process of recognizing the types of sedimentary packaging that you get with microbial mats um good lesson for always listening to your graduate students they have great ideas but also you know there are multiple ways we can get at how life changes a planet and how life responds to planetary changes and those are the kinds of questions we're going for very cool it makes me think a lot about like the Mars sample return process right now going on as well we bring these samples back and if we have a side view of some of this sedimentary rock uh from Mars that could be a huge step forward then using that machine learning process to look at those samples that's right I I I'm I look very keenly when pictures come back from from Curiosity and perseverance so yeah exactly awesome well so you mentioned the EDI Akron kind of as like this period almost like an alien world occurring on our own Earth in the past we did ask another poll of our audience on YouTube um about the timing of the IDI Akron period um it started 635 million years ago and we asked you know how long was this period in general um and we had a lot of answers the correct answer was 96 million years um most people guessed 34 million years um there is some debate as to how the idiacarin came to an end and how we get into the Cambrian radiation or Cambrian explosion then of Life as we know it um what is the current thinking of how this period came to an end and we kind of lost some of those experiments yeah so the idiacron period um was was long ranged from 635 to 539 ish the idiac rebiota inhabit a part of that so they are a part of the ediacron period there's just so many things named after ediacro itself so I think um you know I have the perspective of somebody who works on the idiacrobiota so in my mind the ediacrobiota is the fuse it's the beginning of the rise of animal life and by the end of the idiacrobiota we have most major body plans um there is a debate about what happened to elements of the idiacrobiota um my group would say that within the ediacran period during the time that the idiacrobiota reigned that there was an Extinction likely due to a drop in oxygen so that got rid of many of the things that are near and dear to my heart but what happened right at the end of the precamorean in the beginning of the Cambrian is the subject of debate whether it was environmental changes or the beginning of all of the things that come around in the Cambrian like bioterbaters and predators and did that cause the demise and that the verdict out is out on that I mean many people have very strong views but there isn't a consensus yet but a number of things in the ediacran do make it through so it's not it's not a failed experiment there was a lot of experimentation evolutionary experimentation but some of these things did in fact make it through very cool and that's kind of a fun segue then talking a bit more on the larger scale about life on Earth you are a co lead on one of the NASA astrobiology rcns or research coordination networks indeed the newest one called life I wonder can you tell us the objectives of the life RCN and what we intend to find through this rcn's work yeah sure so um life is uh early sales to multicellularity um it's life all caps and um NASA is big on acronyms this is not an acronym so people always ask us what it means and we're like when we find out we'll let you know um just because that's how we feel about life so life is this newest of five research coordination networks and it's focused on the co evolution of life and the environment on Earth um and so what we're looking at is we're bringing together scientists from all over disciplines so um you know from molecular biology to uh experimental to paleontologists biochemists Mission scientists to look at how you know to look at the nature of life's Innovations and how that changed what was the consequences of those and how chemical and physical processes on Earth impacted um the nature and Advent of these um of these Innovations and I think you know I I this RCN which brings together it's really it's to Foster Community collaboration but I think of it as sort of like your first day of kindergarten right or preschool you you're like wait what there's all these other five year olds um so we in these rcns sort of bring together people who are studying from my perspective say the Advent of multicellularity from so many different perspectives and these aren't people that I would normally interact with or even be on a zoom with and suddenly we're all brought together and we're in zooms or in the same room discussing these major evolutionary Innovations and getting out of our silos and talking you know people who are studying you know the Advent of metabolisms with somebody who's looking at the oldest fossils and it's so exciting and you know it's it would only happen in this sort of RCN framework and it's you know I think it's really bringing science forward much more rapidly than it would ever even if we're like yeah yeah I read those papers but like you know sitting down and talking to somebody is is an amazing thing and we're trying to bring together people who don't even know their astrobiologists or doing astrobio you know they may be doing modeling work or experiment work and not understand how relevant it is to um to what we're doing so very exciting and we have great early career scientists with us and steering committees and so it's um yeah we've been around for about a year we have a new lecture series we've had one uh second one coming up these are open so we invite everybody to join us and we certainly invite uh astrobiologists interested in life to join us as well so very fun awesome yeah and that reminds me a lot of just astrobiology in general as a field it's it really is not a single discipline it's a large field of different discipline that's coming together I've often said one of the best and worst things we ever did to science was break it apart into all of these sub sub disciplines because you ended up with physicists in one building and chemist and another building on the same campus not talking to each other and now with with astrobiology with rcns like life we have people communicating across those boundaries that we're holding them apart before to share ideas and so I really appreciate that Viewpoint so thanks for sharing that so much um something I shared recently on my own Twitter account was an image about convergent evolution and I asked my audience basically what forms of life do they think or what things do they think life would be converging upon for alien life and there were a lot of answers some of my own favorite are things like trees um you know amongst the Crustaceans we have several different convergences as I get to the crab body style um you know certain organisms like lizards losing their legs or mammals losing their legs to become marine mammals what are some of the the conversion things in evolution that we see coming through the ediacara and then towards the end that you think we would see was alien life as well ah um very interesting question I think Mobility um you know the and and not necessarily legs I think long squishy things that move think worm um you know Mobility is such a game changer with respect to life um and uh because it allows organisms to seek out a new environment and and or go get their food right and so I think you know and convergence in in a way to move your body um whether it's legs which we we see or um you know convergence and uh you know dolphins and fish and marine reptiles all have a streamlined body so that they can move in the water and I think those for me my immediate reaction would be convergence that allows you to move um would be my first um off the cuff answer any way and I love that yeah it makes me think a lot about what kinds of movement would be possible out there and like the idea of the little switchy kind of moving structures and other alien worlds who knows if they ever found fins and legs and wings and those things maybe they just kept on moving you know like worms and like little squishy things um it's entirely possible that's true yeah giant squishy things who knows that that's some of the fun of thinking about what alien life could be based on what we know of life here uh I do want to move on to our audience questions very soon so for those watching on YouTube right now please ask your questions in the chat we have moderators who are listening in to get those questions over to me um just a few more things for me myself then before the show we were discussing kind of you know some of your hobbies and interests and one thing you mentioned was that uh during your field your field excursions you've taken your family along with you on your excursions your children who've now grown up and are doing their own things um I wonder you know can you speak to the importance of family life for a scientist as well and and the impact that family has had on your own career yeah no uh great question yeah I mean I'm I do field work so I travel a lot my husband works in the Himalayas so you know also away so from when my kids were in diapers um they would come to south Australia with me and I didn't really give it a thought at the time in retrospect I look back on it and say wow you know and um my first 10 years my mom came along um I would have nieces and nephews come along to watch my kids um and then over time my uh two kids both got involved in the research and we would get them out working in the field and you know nieces and nephews who came before just to watch my kids started coming and and um working in the field and so um kind of a magical for me to have to have had my kids grow up in this way literally it was their summer vacations um I did wonder you know would they hit 16 and say I want to you know go to the mall with my friends and that never happened um one one my daughter there is now studies uh ancient brines on Mars is on the Curiosity Mission which is a grad student at Georgia Tech where Francis is of course and my son as a first year graduate student at Harvard studying Marine microbiology and chemo symbionts and whatnot so paleo adjacent definitely not paleo but you know and and it's and and even nephews and nieces have gone into more science related fields so um I think I am really really really lucky to have had that level of support from my extended family as well as you know to have been able to bring my kids in the field and I do you know when I it was very unusual when I was young and a new mother to do something like that and people were horrified that I would do that and take my children to the Outback um but wow it came out well and and you know I do think that it's a way in in way that we can visualize how we can parent and still be scientists at the same time that's kind of an extreme but there are other examples of how we can we can do that so yeah I love that so much I think during the pandemic a lot of us you know we had our children with us during our Zoom calls and our meetings and I think they became kind of more Acceptance in some ways for some people that you know we also have our own families and our own lives outside of the science that we're doing and so if we can include in our families in our science in our lives that's all the better because it gives us a chance to kind of enjoy the community of having everyone together and learning and sharing in that way so I'm so thankful for you sharing that with us we are going to move on now to our faster than light segment this is where we have a few simple questions um requiring simple answers hopefully um about some of the things that we wonder about astrobiology and the history of life and things like this the first question comes from the idea of fermi's paradox which is more of a question um that you know where are they and so my question for you is what is your favorite answer to fermi's question where are they hmm good answer yeah absolutely that was the big thing I think a lot of people say it's just so vast can they even travel that fast across space and time how much time would it take to travel tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or from other galaxies millions or billions of light years um the truth is we don't know a current propulsion yeah a long time um so here's one that's near dear to my heart since I love Science Fiction and Fantasy so much I love reading about what's possible and thinking about human stories what kinds of in sports stories have inspired you to want to explore more about life um so I I'm gonna go back to my childhood again so I was and this is TV show so story um so as a little kid watching Star Trek and I remember an episode and they're on a planet and there are these rocks that are like it's a rock organism and and Captain Kirk is really like what you know and and Bones goes you know I think it was might have been Spock is like it's not a car that's not a carbon based organism that's a silica based organism and I remember being like wait there are silica based organisms you know and like you know I was like five years old but honestly that has stuck with me as sort of this way to conceptualize life on other planets and sort of watching this science fiction show and just being like wow that changes my view you know so anyway a little bit not not some great read but rather just having watched a TV show as a very little kid awesome I think Star Trek has impacted a lot of us who are in The Sciences now um so that's awesome so you've had a very prestigious career you've done so many incredible things but if you could take the knowledge you have now and go back to meet yourself at the beginning of your career what kind of advice would you give yourself um yeah as you said I've been very lucky if I if I were I I would say find your people um and I was really lucky past me was very lucky in terms of finding my people um but I think what I'd give advice to younger faculty or early career scientists is you know find your colleagues your students Junior and senior to you colleagues your family find your support group and find your colleagues that you respect and trust and who trust and respect you and and hold on to those people um and I think it is about the people you interact with not the institutions you go to but really who is it that you work with that you're learning from is really important and I was very very lucky on that score I love that um what is something that excites you about the future um gosh right now I would say the early early career scientists getting into astrobiology so when I was young astrobiology wasn't a field I mean I was like mid career before astrobiology was a was a field and and uh you have your graduates right now there is AB gradcon in San Diego which is bringing together graduate students in astrobiology um so it's The Graduate students Junior faculty young Mission scientists and you know coming together and bringing so many different perspectives and and diversity of backgrounds and scientific backgrounds and unconventional thinking and you know it's just bringing new voices to the table I think is so exciting and you know just coming at it from a very different perspective and different than you know starting off on siled so it's not saying oh we're bringing in molecular biologists these are starting off on siled which is terrific I love that good shout out for ab gradcon I was a past member eventually co organizer eventually lead organizer for ab gradcon um and I love that you know everyone's learning all of these different disciplines together there aren't different sessions it's all one session where everyone's everyone's joining in together it's fabulous huge fan huge fan absolutely so what is the best part of your job um that I get to work on the ediac or biota where it was discovered um what a privilege and obviously the people I work with students and colleagues and family that I get to work there with but you know I go back in three weeks from now and I I get like antsy I can't wait I get out in the field and I'm like how is it that I am so lucky to sit here and uncover these fossils and honestly and this is my job that's crazy I love that so much um so one more question for our faster than light segment it's my favorite question of all what is one scientific fact that still blows your mind um from a biological perspective I would say um it's the commonality of Developmental controls among animals and this is in my lifetime that we've figured this out you know the fact that there are similar genetic Pathways and genes involved in the body organization of all animals and disparate animal plans so we can you know that that idea of the same pathway um we wouldn't have ever imagined it and it's a way also of thinking about and interpreting the the idiacrobiota I think wow that's cool so yes I mean the number of exoplanets also very very cool but um the sort of genetic pathway and common theme that's amazing absolutely I love that so much we are going to transition now to our audience questions so for those watching live on YouTube right now you can ask your questions in the chat we'll try to get as many as we can in the teleprompter I see we have a large number already um but we wanted to start with kind of a fun one so as a geologist I think any of us who've done any kind of geology at some point someone's going to walk up to you and say Here's a rock I found what is it um I've had this happen with family members with what they think our meteorites I've had people I don't even really know bring up rocks to me and say what is this and we had a user on Twitter reach out uh for our questions and they wanted to know if you could identify a fossil for them uh user Brindley Ash on Twitter said they found this fossil in north Alabama and I think we have a picture of it going up right now and their question for you is could you identify this this fossil from this image um so thank you Brindley I love this kind of thing so I I uh did take a peek and so my first thing to say is you know I'm not sure right this isn't like it's a trilobite um what it most reminds me of and what my first gut would be is that it's a cannulaired which is an extinct organism um that had four sides sort of like a four sided pyramid but a cone um if I'm looking at it correctly it looks like it's sort of on Moss or something which gives me a scale of about that big which would be consistent with cannulerin um it looks like it has some pustule things around the edge not sure what they are Conyers we don't think had pustule things around the outside so I could be completely often at some part of a vertebrate um but that would be my my first Port of Call what what I would do in this and and if it's a conularity we they have phosphate plates and this doesn't appear to so then we take it the next step and say is it a mold or a cast like you would have a cast on your arm and so this would be the outside of a of a canola um you know we look to see what age rockets and do we have other specimens from there and so on but um thank you for this that would be my my first my first uh gut on that I love it that's great because it's hard to know unless you have it in hand and even then you have to do some work sometimes to figure out exactly what you're holding in your hand sample as well our next question there you go our next question comes from Jim pass on Twitter uh Jim has first off a question that I think I can handle here a little bit asking about risks to humans over time for exploring Mars um assuming they might be viruses or bacteria there and whether or not they can hurt us and I think the immediate answer is what we really don't know if they have a different origin and lineage than us then they're probably less likely to actually be able to hurt us or interact with us if they have the same lineage though that actually could mean that they have some potential to do some harm um but there's such a wide range of possibility that we really don't know however Jim has a second part to his question that I think is actually kind of interesting here he wants to know what the status and roles for an astro sociologist could could be um in doing these kinds of missions and given with the the nopina idiokura national park you know it's not just about the fossil bed it's also about the people and the culture and the history I wonder do you have a vision for how sociologists fit into the work that we're doing in astrobiology oh I I think um for many in many different ways I would say in terms of Neil Pina it is the traditional lands of the adnanamatna people and that is very very important to us and and and will always be the traditional lands of Vietnam people and I think that is um something that is important to us and important for us to respect whether on Earth or in fact on Mars um in terms of uh working with people you can't work on you can't work in science without working with people and understanding um the culture either of the area where you're doing field work or in fact um you know asking the difficult questions about you know doing whether you're doing experiments or going thinking about going to another plan and of course we do we do worry about that um in terms of the impact of going to another planet also on our own culture so yes absolutely unequivocally um astrobiology isn't just about science it brings in all sorts of of disciplines including sociology so yes absolutely awesome uh we have two questions that are fairly similar one from accelerator 712 on Twitter the other from Hilbert Spectrum on Twitter um the first one was what was earth's ambient temperature during the early formation of animal life but connected to that is this other question of can paleontology tell us about the history of the environment and the environmental history during periods like the ediacaran when these things were changing so much um great questions so um the Earth has had vastly different climates than we do now when the dinosaurs were around there were no glaciers at the poles for example it's been a lot lot colder and a lot lot hotter and some of that evidence comes from the fossil record and a lot of that evidence comes from the geochemical record that's preserved in rocks so in terms of the ambient temperature when the idiacrobiota were around the base of the ediacran period is marked at the base of what we at the end of what we call snowball Earth which is um the time we've evidenced that there were glaciers actually down at the equator and you know whether the Earth was a snowballing completely covered in snow and ice or whether it was more of a slush fall and oceans were open we don't know but that's a really different world than we imagined today in terms of by the time the idiacrobiota first appear they lived in very different environments and at different latitudes so this is the oldest IDI acrobiota lived in the deep sea not the ones at nilpina but older than that that would have been cold no matter what colder than the shallow Parts they spanned certainly from the equator to well into the higher latitude so the idiacrobiota would have experienced a lot of different different temperatures but we were past um past snowballers and in fact they first appear after a second sort of glaciation so I don't think they would have they weren't around during times of glaciation but um the fossil record is is one of the greatest insights into understanding past climate change which helps us of course understand and constrain future climate change and and understanding the past and how organisms responded to past climate change informs future climate change so great questions awesome uh Larry Ryan on Twitter has asked what your your most revealing or maybe favorite Discovery has been so far oof so many um I I have to go back to sort of the scientists rarely have light bulb moments um even when I uncover a new body plan we're like yeah is that really a new body plan or what is that so we've had the excitement of discovering new body plans and fossils some of which we're still discovering um one of my most favorite moments was um actually I had two different um fossils that I was trying to figure out and I just didn't understand them um and and literally having a light bulb moment with a particular slab of rocks when I could put them together and realized one was the hold fast of the other um so you know the sort of root of the other and this ultimately became phenicia and we found lots and lots of similar sized hold fests together um with these similar sized phenicias so that told us a lot about the reproduction I'm going to make this long story very short but basically evidence of sexual reproduction and so it was our oldest sort of pretty definitive evidence of sexual reproduction in animals um that was really exciting and um led to some very um fun and sort of crazy media after that um and you can imagine sort of the roads in which um different organizations picked that up but um that was that was really a fun literal light bulb moment of oh my gosh these two parts go to the same animal that was great that's awesome yeah and like the the evolution of sexual reproduction this ability for for organisms to swap genes together like that allows for so much more biodiversity and so much more potential for evolutionists that's a very huge moment I love that so much uh we have uh user Jared Brunk on Twitter wants to know first about Europa Clipper and possibly finding life and then also uh what you think about europans in the Europa ocean possibly being anything similar to what we've seen here for the animal life on Earth um I will personally start off by saying that Europa Clipper is a wonderful Mission it not it's not going to be looking into the ocean of Europa directly uh it'll be monitoring the Surface by orbiting around Jupiter and Europa together giving us an understanding of the chemistry of the surface helping us to understand the depth of the ocean um it might have a chance of sampling some fluid if there are plumes coming out of Europa we don't know if there's there there yet or not for sure um but it's not going to immediately be testing the ocean however Dr duroser what do you think of this possibility for there to be a europan biosphere anything like Earth's yeah I'm very excited about the Europa mission um because of course you know we think icy world's Ocean World we're an ocean world we have ocean life as far as we know originated in the ocean so I'm very excited and you know I think what what we're trying to do there and the same thing that we do when we go back in time is constrain the environment was this an environment that might have been suitable for life and I think we'll get a lot of those answers from this Mission not necessarily hey there's a dickinsonia on the sea floor um in terms of what might be there or a way to find life um I think we're you know if people ask me about oh are you going to find ediograph fossils on other planets and my answer to that is you know no I don't think we will because Evolution would by chance or different conditions take a different pathway um so we might find life there um we might find microbial life a very very simple life but it's understanding the chemical and biological processes that might give us that life that that I think is really interesting and that that we're going for I'd love to find a needy Akron fossil on the sea floor of Europa um pretty sure that's not going to happen but it would kind of be a big day for me yeah I think it'd be a big day for all of us yeah it would be a big day any life would be a big day absolutely so coming back to Earth now we kind of mentioned this idea of of understanding some of the Earth's uh environmental record temperature record through paleontology we have two fairly similar questions we have one from rendering reality 3D animations on YouTube asking about the chemistry of the sea water during the idiacaran but then we also have user SL on YouTube has said uh they're at UC Berkeley biology major planetary science minor um and they want to know if the edacaran correlated with the Cambrian explosion Cambrian radiation and the goe which we kind of discussed already can you kind of give us a vision then of kind of the understanding of Earth's changes leading through to the E Akron period yeah okay so um yes so the goe was about 2 billion years ago and that's the great oxygenation event and it's the first timer we really sort of reach high levels of oxygen and and or higher levels of oxygen and between then and the um sort of when we see the idiacrabiota oxygen changed a lot and and shifted um and there are many people who are trying to really pull apart and tease apart the history of oxygen during that time and how it relates to say the first appearance of eukaryotes which would is a very big event obviously um in terms of uh sort of the sea water during the idiacran as as we come up to it um the big the big part of the chemistry of the sea water we're interested in is the oxygen um and as I mentioned earlier organisms need oxygen the idiacrobiota would have needed oxygen um there's a lot of evidence that oxygen increased um right before the Advent of the ediacrobiota and I think we're not surprised about that and we think that that was a factor and that even the history of the idiacrobiota was tied to changing oxygen levels in the ediacran um and we we tease apart the the oxygen from geochemical proxies that give us an idea of this um and the but the Cambrian radiation happened after the ediacran period um and after the ediacrobiota uh many of which would have been extinct before the sort of Cambrian radiation from my perspective um I think of the ediacran is just the beginning the the sort of fuse that led to the Cambrian radiation and that there were extinctions within that but it was one continuous um sort of radiation my husband works on the Cambrian he's you know he likes to think the action was in the Cameron but um but I think of it as really much more of a continuous radiation of animals that was with a backdrop of very dramatic changing conditions on Earth many of which had to do with oxygen some of which had to do with physical changes like sea level change um the Advent changing biochemistry Advent of skeletonizers and what that does to Ocean geochemistry so lots of changes um going on during this time great questions awesome uh user Blue List on YouTube first off they're a geology student and said that they love the idea of Exploring Life and rock interactions so yeah geology um how important are microfossils for astrobiology oh huge huge I mean microfossils are how we understand um life before we get multi you know before we get like the IDI acrobiota and multicellular um algae that we can see so to be honest for most of our record it is the record of microfossils whether they're microfossils of eukaryotes or micro fossils of prokaryotes so hugely important aspect of our understanding of um life as it evolved on our planet we need to understand our planet first I mean we have a record we can understand it and microfossils play a very very important role in that absolutely we have another two very similar questions I'm gonna bring them together first off Sean M on YouTube wanted to know if there was any indication you've seen so far for the IDI Akron um that there were the right conditions for evolution were localized kind of to the regions we've seen so far or if we think what was happening during the idiacran really was planetary scale and then connected to that is arunov upadar who has been a past researcher with Blue Marble space Institute of science is currently a graduate student in zwalbard so he's made a big move from India to the high Arctic and he wants to know if IDI Akron fossils have been found in the Arctic and if so are they different from places in lower latitudes and so I think those two questions kind of merge well together how what was the global extent of the IDI Akron to our knowledge um so as far as we know they were globally expanded globally these are soft bodied organisms so right off the bat you're trying to preserve soft bodied organisms in the fossil record that's hard there were a number of conditions in the ediacran that led to um ways in which it was easier to preserve soft bodied fossils than than it is now um but the same fossils that we found many of the same fossils that we find at nilpina are found say in the White Sea of Russia and even when you reconstruct paleo tectonics that they were not close together so that's we think they were pretty Global and that it is a function of the rock record and the the right environments of the time and then preserving those rocks um now over half a billion years later we do have a high level of my city so there were some things that were very local um but we have other tax even at the species level that were all over the place things um in terms of ediacran fossils at the Arctic and the Arctic at the time um we don't have evidence of that um because we don't have fossils from places we don't have rocks from places that were actually at the poles during the ediacran um so again that comes back to the Rock record um we do find we have a handful of really good localities of ediacran fossils but we have um scraps then that's not a very nice word to say about fossils but bits and pieces of fossils at a lot of localities around the world and that helps us understand their distribution even if we find you know a single part of one that we can identify that still puts an ediacran fossil there so also great questions yeah I think for arunova it could help to go online too just look at how the continents themselves have moved over time and where Continental things were at at that period of time as well it might help you envision then kind of what the world looked like at that period of time we have a question from user AC on YouTube they want to know and I guess this is kind of going into genetics now if we can connect the genetics to the fossils they want to know how body plans of organisms evolved along with the genetics as controlled by things like Hawks genes um in your work and in your collaborations do we have good ways to tie our knowledge of of the the genotypes of organisms and changes in genetics to the microfossils that we found um so uh yes what I'd say is you know one of the things that that we can do with IDI acrobiota and one of the the ways that we're starting to think about it is um what can we say about these organisms were they bilaterally symmetrical could they move um and what does it take to do that how did they eat for example and so what are the genes that are required in Mobility what are the genes that are required in having a nervous system that tells you to move you know go after ah there's good mat over there and to go after that or go after a dead animal so in that sense um yeah we're starting to do that sort of Evo Devo work with certain types of of Arts with certain taxa that we have in order to sort of we understand them better looking at them from this perspective as well as well as understanding where they fit in the tree of life can we constrain it was it a true animal was it a EU medicine was it you know do we have any idea and so I think it's it's we're never gonna know but I think by using what we understand about modern Evo Devo we can then start to think about these questions for the 80 acrobiota which I think is a really important Way Forward in understanding how they fit and how these crazy body plans that don't look familiar fit on the tree of life wonderful user AC similarly had a question of what determines body plan um and that is an interesting question that connects to exactly what you just said kind of connecting to you know Evolution development and connecting to our genes but then we have this like this change in body plan and so I want to expand that a little bit and and kind of again speculate about possible alien life out there um do you think we'll have similar body plans to what happened here or does some of the things you found so far from the IDI Akron suggest that there could have been much different body plans leading to larger scale organisms like us what I'd say about the EDI Akron is we look at different body plans but in a way they're all variation on a theme um so going back to Mobility you know if you move you have to have certain constraints um you know where bilaterally symmetrical which helps us move and so on um we have body plans in the ediacran that we don't have today that are you know we have tri radial symmetry right which is there's nothing today that's tri radial and people will get a bunch of replies and they'll say oh but I found this and it's tri rated but really genuine tri radial body plan we have a pile of things that have tri radial symmetry that is an extinct body plan um but it is an organism that sat on the sea floor and probably suspension fed and and whatnot so I think um there's I think it's sort of both ways if there are certain constraints that we have in terms of doing animals doing certain things on the other hand um we have pretty significant body plans that are no longer around today so maybe we'll go to another planet and find something with very very different symmetry um and so on so I'm very open minded yeah I think you have to be when you see all these weird things that life was doing and what could be possible um it's so fun to think about I will ask one more question from the audience this comes from one of our production assistants Anna root mohanty anaroop wants to know why paleontologists and geologists like ourselves Define time looking back in millions or billions of years ago I guess as opposed to like you know years from the beginning um and won't that scale make things tricky for geologists millions of years from now great question um yeah I mean I think it's it it's how we communicate right so now is what we know um and of course as we have gotten better and better over the history of geology right going back 200 years when we didn't know how old the Earth was the logical place is to start now and look back um and and it's so it's both a way of communicating as well as just um showing our under our increasing understanding of geologic time and how old the Earth is and how we have learned that um I look forward to geologists millions of years having trouble with this issue I think that would be a great problem to have um yeah yeah I'm hoping that there are geologists millions of years from now yeah um so you know for our audience who are watching you know with Dr Mary jeruser here we talked about the idiacaran um how you know this was really an alien environment and it gives us an idea of what other alien environments might be out there right now one thing I've been discussing a lot with people lately right now is the emergence of these large language models and how machine learning and artificial intelligences are really taking off right now and it makes some of us wonder whether the first form of alien intelligence with which we communicate might be one of our own creation do you think maybe these large language models and AIS that we're creating right now will become the very first aliens that we meet if you have any input on that feel free to reach out to me I'm at cosmobiologist across the interwebs you can reach out on the at Nasa astrobio Twitter account or go to Sega net.org and drop us a line there we'd love to hear from you and hear your opinions I also want to say if you are interested in learning more about the neopini nilpina idiokara national park there is a website from the national parks and wildlife services of South Australia it's a really beautiful website there's some information there you can find maybe even if you want to go and tour the the area yourself and see this National Park in the future of course for those who are tuning in right now live or watching the YouTube video later uh if you want to sign up for the NASA astrobiology mailing list you'll get information about our show about articles being published by NASA astrobiology of many other events conferences meetings ways to get involved in this realm of astrobiology being conducted through the NASA astrobiology program so Dr Mary dresser thank you so much for joining us for all of your Insight and for answering the questions our audience had for you thanks for having me that's been great and we do want to give a special acknowledgment as well to credit for some of the images and video we've showed to Sam Oster Robert Lang and the South Australian
