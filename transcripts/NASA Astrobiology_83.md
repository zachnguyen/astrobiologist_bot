what is your favorite answer to ferm's question where are they well my my favorite answer which is pretty much tongue and cheek is they don't want anything to do with us because we've made such a mess of ourselves here the more serious answer is that it's not so much where are they but we understand very little about human intelligence and even less about nonhuman terrestrial intelligence and to think that we'll be able to recognize signs of extraterrestrial intelligence and actually communicate I find very hard to swallow
