if you could communicate with any non human organism on Earth what would it be and what would you want to talk about man there's so many but I I think I'd have to focus on on organisms that you're attached to personally and interact with personally and of course dogs and cats are the first thing that comes up cuz who hasn't sat there and looked at a dog or a cat you know their animal companion and thought like what are they thinking or like what what are they trying to tell me but I think for me it's maybe trees I feel very attached to trees there's a cops of Bur Oak in okaboji Iowa that I've grown up with and I adore and I would love to be able to speak with trees in that sense because the time scale of their life is so much different than ours and I would love to hear stories about my hometown and and things from hundreds of years ago and those trees were saplings and you know that sort of thing and you have trees that in California that are thousands of years old and and I think the stories that they could tell would just be amazing and I love storytelling so I'd love to just sit there and listen to them talk
