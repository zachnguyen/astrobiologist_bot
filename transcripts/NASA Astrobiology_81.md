[Music] [Applause] [Music] a [Music] greetings friends fello earthlings and explorers of the unknown and welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientist involved in our quest to understand the nature of life as usual I'm your host Dr Graham the cosmobiology Lao and we're brought to you by the NASA astrobiology program and segan net.org as always we want to give a huge shout out to all of you out there sharing about our show engaging with me engaging with our guest engaging with the NASA astrobiology program in sanet um and talking about this wonderful thing of looking for life beyond Earth and understanding life here on Earth uh as as usual we love giving a big shout out to one person in particular who shares about the show each month as our ambassador of the month this month we'd like to highlight Dr Jim pass many of you have heard his questions before for our guest in the show Dr pass loves to tune in and talk about Astros sociology uh bringing the science and the understanding of human interactions to space so thank you very much Jim for sharing about ask an astrobiologist now today's episode is hopefully going to inflame your sense of adventure and interest in Mars as much as I know it will mine today we have joining us Dr Michael Meyer he's the former lead scientist for NASA's Mars exploration and Mars sample return programs Dr Meyer was the program scientist for the river curiosity uh the 2001 Mars Odyssey Mission he was on the Mars micro probe Mission and for two space shuttle and mere space station experiments he was also the senior scientist for astrobiology from 2001 to 2006 managed NASA's exobiology program from 1994 to 1997 and was also the planetary Protection Officer for NASA I mean such incredible things uh Dr Meer recently retired from NASA but has returned here now to share his knowledge and his wisdom from Decades of service to the science to the space exploration to astrobiology to Mars for all of us now so uh Dr Meyer welcome and thank you for joining us for asking astrobiologist well I want to thank you for inviting me as you might imagine am I always willing to talk about astrobiology so thanks yeah absolutely it's a fun topic to talk about and one that you spent many years of your life and your career exploring um as usual we love for our guests when they first come on our show to give us a bit of their origin story what got them into the careers they chose to pursue in their lives we have a lot of people watching the show who maybe are young scientists or early career researchers who want to know how can I get from where I am to where you've been in your life so would you mind sharing a bit about your personal Journey with us yeah I mean this is kind of interesting in that um I had no intention whatsoever early on of ending up doing what I'm well was doing for NASA uh is a pretty much a random walk essentially a couple of things came together one was you know I did well enough in high school just kind of well enough that uh my guidance counselor said oh you should be an engineer you're pretty good at math so I I just you know applied to schools and I decided I'd be an engineer but before I actually went to college I got hired as a deck hand for the summer uh for Treasure salvaging off at the co Coast of Florida and you know at the time it's one of the things I've been around boats as a as a kid and I knew how to do stuff so it was a reasonable job um and I'd always been interested in the ocean read a lot of uh books and uh I love jacow you know this is I figured that would be such a great thing to to have Adventures at Sea and you know go scuba div and see all these great things so when I was on at working as a deck hand uh the person who running the operation fired all the other divers because basically they were uh they were smoking while they were working and uh so it wasn't really the best of conditions and uh he asked me if I want to learn how to dive so I started diving and so and the first time I went in the water it was kind of like whoa everything I thought I knew now although I recognized things now it made more sense now it was an environment not just pretty picturers or pretty fish or Prett you know that kind of thing it was an environment in which I was in and immersed in it and that was that was a powerful experience and kind of convinced me that we know so little about things that we think we know something about so that was one of the things that uh really got me interested and then um I went to college as an you know started as an engineer and I must admit I didn't find I found engineering kind of interesting but I found biology much more interesting so I went to biology in particular cell biology because at that time we were just learning about cells you know what the structures were what does the endoplasmic reticulum do that kind of thing and I felt you know there's a lot of there's a lot of exploration here there's a lot of room for new knowledge because nobody knows what's going on they're just bringing new tools on that give them a better look about what's going on within the cell and I found that pretty exciting so um pursued that course I must you know and it's one of those things where then I went on to graduate school in oceanography got a doctorate in oceanography in biological oceanography looking at single cell plants in the ocean I ended up doing a lot of work in polar areas actually around Antarctica and that put me on the path to studying life and extreme environments the first real job I got um as a postto was actually working with someone emry Friedman in Florida who is studying sing cell plants in deserts around the world and it's kind of like I remember the phone interview you know he's we're talking and after about 10 minutes I go you know emry I am getting my degree in oceanography right and he goes what's your problem my degree is in Marine Biology so it kind of like that was our our our bond and uh after that you know I did a lot of research deserts around the world and that got me into the whole NASA thing of using life and extreme environments as a model to what we should be looking for elsewhere and what should the approach be and uh and that was great very interesting I had lots I love fieldwork and then uh as a you know assistant professor kind of thing I decided you know I should probably go and check that bureaucratic box go to headquarters run a program for two years get something on the books that will be a benefit to scientists in areas I like I like looking for life elsewhere and then I'll go back to my research and I'll be a better position to you know get the next step up and that kind of thing well I got there and I found a you could get a lot done if you have a purpose and um it was I decided after a couple of years and they wanted me to stay that I was probably the most glib microbiologist I knew and then I could actually get more science done that where I was at headquarters than I would as a researcher and so that's kind of started me on the path of I was started to run the exobiology program and uh and I my purpose was NASA needs to recognize that they have the tool to look for Li elsewhere this is the new thing the new technology that we can now answer questions about things things that we've been asking for Millennia and now we can actually get some data so that and then the rest has been a fun ride that's incredible and such a cool way to kind of bring together these interests you started off with as a young person and kind of bringing those into this realm it's kind of interesting you had this experience kind of like you know salvaging and treasure hunting and then connecting that to a different kind of treasure hunting and looking at life and deserts and polar environments and then looking for life out there which is very much a form of treasure hun as well for many of us in the astrobiology realm um now of course a lot of your a lot of your background through NASA and your your time with NASA was focused on Mars missions their development and their history and so you know you really are a great person to ask this question of you know through all of your roles at Nasa how have you seen the Arc of Mars exploration and Mars missions um including planetary science and astrobiology how have you seen that grow and evolve to where we are now that's a that's an interesting question the well number one what Viking was a little over 50 years ago you know our first real kind of first you know astrobiology kind of mission so we had a lot to go through um and I think one of the things that that I think is really critical to understand is in that time period Viking was disappointed for most to the scientific world and it was a fantastic Mission very successful did some great things but the expecting to find little aliens running around and not finding anything everybody just kind of went oh never mind that was a a wrong direction to go in but at the same time we discovered life and hydrothermal beds in the bottom of the ocean this was a big surprise at that time and Brock was Finding life in extremely hot environments elsewhere and so there is this disconnect between oh Mars is too harsh there's no life there and oh we're finding life in places on Earth that we never expected because we thought it was too extreme for them to live there that that it was a great setup right um and so one of the really nice things that happened is we were able to move exobiology from at the time was the Ossa office of space and office of space Sciences uh sciences and application um and they had the life sciences portion of you know uh what experiments to do on Space Station that sort of thing uh but the the real let's say where exobiology astrobiology really pay off is getting missions else where and looking at life on other planetary bodies or looking for signs of life around extra solar planets so we were able to move it into this the science directorate that was doing the physical and physical sciences right I think that ended up being very useful and that now the questions being asked were related to what missions were possible and what missions can ask you know able to ask right questions so one of the things extremely fortuitous is early on we did this strategy well if we're going to look for life elsewhere how should we do it and you know by using the lessons from Viking and also what in our own planet we realized we don't really know that much we have a lot to learn about biology and we only have one example on Earth so the exology Strate strategy for Mars exploration laid out a path of go to the planet and orbit it and do things on the global scale if it still looks good now you need to focus on regions with better instruments if that still looks good send things to the surface so you can see whether or not what you thought you knew you really knew and whatever else you can find out if it still looks good then get those samples and bring them home so that's been sort of a a guidepost for the whole program and as we as an example for Mars as we've looked harder it's still been promising and telling us that there's still a potential so the whole art was kind of like that I would say one of the things for two it this this is back to what I was thinking about is when we're getting astrobiology going trying to promote the idea we had two major scientific events alh84001 the Mars meteorite that had wonderfully interesting things to offer in terms of uh telling us about Mars including the possibility of life and then also finding extra solar planets first confirmed extra Solar Planet both both of those happened within about a year of each other and one of the and that catapulted exobiology astrobiology into a recognition not only is this a great question but also legitimate science because at the time exobiology had the highest number of National Academy members you know proportion wise than any other program in at Nasa and so when they looked into it they thought oh this is actually legitimate science and asking and their big questions and obviously these big questions there could be some pretty big answers and so that helped catapult things forward and um and that started a real program where astrobiology got part of Missions going to other planets part of the astronomy program and I think now it's now we're getting data back now we're trying to sort through things that we're we we're really learning yeah I love that you connect the Arc of Mars exploration to the Arc of astrobiology at Nasa as well like they're they are very highly connected and I think a lot of younger students maybe who are coming up now and exploring astrobiology as a career or as you know just a research interest perhaps um they have the astrobiology primer that early career researchers have written they can see the old astrobiology road maps the astrobiology strategy you know we have all of these connections to the Mars program and the things that have happened previously um and you know the NASA astrobiology program itself um is a world leader in considering life in a cosmic context and so you know the program has developed you've seen it grow now along with the the the Mars program as astrobiology has has grown and blossomed out is there a vision you have for where maybe that the future researchers who are watching right now uh where their work in astrobiology and Mars exploration might take us I I'll say two things one is uh one of the challenges of the early program was convincing people who are doing other things in quotes biology that they might be astrobiologist and so part of the strategy is laying out the things that we need to know are not just how organisms work we didn't we need to know the physical and chemical environment we need to know whether or not water was on Mars three billion years ago that's sort of thing so part of it is recognizing that your role in all of astrobiology is whatever discipline you're really good at making sure you're aware of how that connects to the possibility of life and so as we go forward and start exploring more things there are some real areas of research that are be going to be coming up if you look to what future missions are going to be or even ones are happen like you you know the uh Europa Clipper is going to bring back data in I forget some five six year I forget quite the time frame but this launching this this fall and there will be a lot of what does this data mean and you can be prepared with the type of experiments that might actually help supplement the data that's coming back and and and helps inform everybody else what is the meaning of this and examples for in the past of Mars exploration is the whole thing with perchlorate something that we didn't expect and so now there's a fair amount of research being done on that the other is what is deliquescence and is that an issue does that provide a temporary environment that life can flourish and you know and it depends on it's actually one of those things where it's a it's a kinetics thing as opposed to a state so I guess that's one thing the other is keep your eyes open because you don't know what's going to you know I got in this whole thing because I was just doing what I thought was interesting and by doing something that was interesting and not necessarily what everybody else told you was interesting I actually had a a nice background that other people didn't when it came time to putting things together yeah that's crucial yeah having a diversity of interest and skills is is super important and you you mentioned already some of these key Milestones of astrobiology and finding hydrothermal vents and finding exoplanets and you know this this work with the Allen Hills meteorite and and some of these other major Milestones with Viking and some other research that we've had that you know we really didn't know some of these things were going to be so important in our understanding of life in a universal context um you me you also mentioned earlier in the The Arc of Mars exploration programs this idea of eventually getting to the point of bringing samples back um of course you know Mars sample return has been a big question um which samples can we bring back how can we interrogate them um a lot of people also are worried potentially about issues you you've done work in the planetary protection office as a planetary Protection Officer um I wonder like how realistic is the Andromeda Strain for instance as a scenario for Mars samples um how can we frame the value of returning those samples um along with addressing some potential threats uh or that might worry some people well that's a very good question and it's one of those things where it it's a real challenge because uh despite all our efforts we don't have a tricorder yet we don't have a measurement tells us whether or not something is alive I mean there's things that you could do where if it walks in front of you then you know it's alive kind of thing but we on the molecular level on the cellular level we don't have we don't have a good handle on we have a reasonable handle on life on Earth because we know enough about it we know the the experiment to do you know we know what food to feed it to see if it eats it kind of the thing so for planetary protection this is a a a real issue I mean the Mars samples are tremendously important uh I'll give some sort of comparisons right now the closest we all look at anything on the surface of Mars is a couple of or of magnitude less than we could look at pieces of Mars we brought them back to Earth so we're way outside the scale of a microb so we just haven't even looked at things at the scale that is let's say critically important for understanding the potential real life Mars the other is while we've analyzed things on Mars it's been fantastic and we found it so interesting but it's been bulk we've been taking a sample taking the whole sample and vaporizing it or looking at with a spectrometer we get some spatial resolution on a pretty crude scale with remote sensing you know closeup like RAM on Spectros and that sort of thing but we don't actually know how the minerals are interacting with each other you bring the samples back each grain that you get has a story it has a geologic history that's preserved in what it is and you can look at it it'll tell you and so if you get a bunch of different grains you can you can look at them and say oh these all came from one event or they came from a huge number of different events that kind of thing uh also being the grains together they're going to interact and it tells you what was going on between when they're deposited to when you got it so the tonomy so what happened in between they go through periods of wet and all that kind of we have some good the but you need to look at the Rocks themselves so the mount that we can learn from bring samples back is going to that's what's going on it'll be you know comes to light right now looking for life but that's a real challenge because you have very small samples you can't just throw them in a Petri dish and hope something shows up because it could be completely wrong we can't even take soil out of our backyard throw it in a Petri dish and grow everything is there in fact you only grow like 1% of what's there so it's it's it's complicated right um and and we're just now working through and this is where research is very helpful and what things do we think are characteristic of life and so what should we look for and we have sort of this ongoing thing in astrobiology of agnostic bio signatures and the idea is you don't look for specific compound you look for a complex compound and then you decide whether or not it could be made from you know chemistry or is it made from biology and you have to look at it from a different direction works with that so these are kind of the research that's very helpful and we're working through what you when we get the samples back we're working through right now what is the protocol to say okay we did not find anything in this sample it's okay to send to the outside world we'll send some sterilized samples to start with just so that we get other information while we're waiting and then you can declare this to be sent out to outside how to make that process efficient and convincing is a real challenge I think we can do a really good job so addressing sort of the last question of you know the risk versus benefit and that kind of thing um I I just want to point out that the more bizarre life is is was on Mars perhaps the more difficult it is for us to find it find what it's doing but also the more let's say unusual or Super Bug life purported Martian life is um the more more unbelievable it be that all the Mars meteorites we're getting on Earth today haven't already started a martian Colony so so the so the point is we don't have to expect something amazingly unusual in terms of capabilities because we've been getting Mars rocks since day one on the surface of Earth and we don't have anything that has shown up as you know what's this alien thing doing it hasn't happened so so you you should be cautious you should do you know you should do what you need to do to convince yourself that okay this is not an issue or you go wow we we did the looking for complex Organics and we just found a whole chain of them okay now you know we're in the money we now have something to really look at and and and that's great news either way it's great news because we're going to learn something about early Mars and whether or not life really got started and died out whether or not it just didn't quite get there because of X or Y but either way we're going to get a data point that tells us how common is life in the universe that's fantastic and you know Mars really could be the first other place we could find life or not find life which is super important um I do want to go to a poll that we had for our audience now on YouTube uh you've been invol involved with the Mars Odyssey uh spacecraft the mission and those first actual detections of water we we knew since Viking in early images there were signs of the activity of water but really finding like detections of hydrous minerals and understanding that there had been water in the past on Mars's surface is a huge finding and so we thought based on that you've even mentioned like Organics on Mars and then like um Mars meteorites we wanted to ask our audience what they thought were like that was like the key Milestone of Mars exploration especially for astrobiology uh we gave the option of detection of water on Mars exploring Martian meteorites uh detection of organic compounds on mars or exploring the methane on Mars mystery um and most of most of the those who responded 54 percent of those who responded uh said that detection of organic compounds on the surface of Mars has been the most important Milestone I wonder if you can speak to that uh how important has it been you know using our Rovers to detect organic compounds on the surface of Mars and knowing that there is organic chemistry now for us to explore so in some ways you kind of captured it right we what we know that there's organic compounds landing on the Mars because of infall for meites meites have organic well not all but have organic compounds so there's a certain Baseline that you expect to find but you know one of the things that we picked up from Vikings is the surface of Mars is highly oxidizing and we also knew for quite some time that it's also highly irad so complex compounds would get Zed and through time basically oxidize and turn into carbon dioxide or or some kind of Highly refracturing material so you got it the fact that we find complex organic compounds on Mars means that something there was something there for Define it also points to one of the huge challenges of sending spacecraft to Mars and trying to do our experiments versus bring samples back we learned that they're complex organic compounds it's a real struggle to figure out what the parent compound was that before you vaporized it and measure the components of it and that's critical that's the part that tells you is this a a molecule that we can't make in in our physical chemical World it has to be done by Al or is it something oh yeah this is this is just a a product of the Fisher trop reaction so it makes a huge difference on how how that complex compound what it is because that tells you that gives you a hint I should put it that way gives you a hint of how it might have been so the fact that we can measure it with the crude instruments we're studying on spacecraft crude is is over an exaggeration they're highly sophisticated but they're not something you can do in the lab tells us that there's enough there for us to have a lot of fun measuring the things that are in the samples at along the lines of organic yeah that's wonderful um I will say so of those who responded one person decided to to say other that there was something else they thought was a key Milestone and for them it was flying on another planet uh they were really happy to talk about Ingenuity and this this test drone flight of course we have the upcoming dragonfly Mission that's going to be a massive drone flying around the surface of Titan um through your career you've now seen you know we've gone from early flybys to having orbiters and then Landers and then Rovers now drones flying on other worlds and so you've kind of seen some of these changes in time not just like the kinds of the kinds of spacecraft the vehicles that we send to explore other worlds uh you also were were around when we we first used for instance like airbags um for for popping down our Rovers on Mars I wonder if you can share with us maybe maybe more you know specifically what that was like knowing that we were going to bounce a Rover on the surface of Mars and hope that it still worked um as well as kind of this this larger structure of developing these different craft for exploration so let me talk about the me robers for Spirits Spirit opportunity um as you might imagine the science Community is extremely excited about the opportunity to send robers shars with with their choice of instrumentation and um so this is fantastic everybody you know oh my God we're going to get to go we're going to send these little geological explorers going around the surface it will be fantastic and so I remember with the science team the first time we saw the the video of the entry descent and Landing process in which they were using airbags and to a te the science Community almost had a heart attack when they see this thing rock it down and then bounce on the surface something like 30 m into the air and you know bounce again B again then kind of roll around it's like you're gonna do this with my precious instruments are you kidding me it it was it was hard stopping to see that to think of the telegate things you've been working on and and trying to make the work R bus that they work to have to survive that Landing it it really it was crazy I I mean it it was but it worked and so that's in some ways that's the fun of the whole thing you know if if there was something like me Rover edl videos or even curiosity videos at the time I was a nation engineer I probably would have stayed an engineer because that was hairbrain and fun so so pression the more more uh progression instrumentation has been really good in terms of what we're getting in terms of data I must admit you know one of the things that with instrumentation on perseverance we're now getting some spatial resolution of minerology and Elemental composition so that gives you a much better hint of what type of mineral and what process has gone through you know that when you're looking at it and it's it's pretty pretty amazing and that's all been enabled one of the things uh I thought was really interesting is when Mars exploration first started we had something like 11 missions per year not we but the world had like 11 missions per year mostly because they failed you s it blew up okay let's send another one and now um we're we're down to maybe a couple or maybe one depending upon um what year it is and what other countries are also sending spacecraft and and at first it goes oh Mars exploration is declining no that actually is not the case what's happening is we're getting much better at the instrumentation we can put on the spacecraft and we've certainly increased the odds of having a successful Mission and so we're getting much more information than we ever did early on and and the days of exploration yeah absolutely and we we have a lot more missions in the works right now there's a lot of missions from from NASA but also from other space agencies from jaxa and ISRO and others right now in development for future exploration of Mars and the rest of our solar system and beyond um I encourage our audience we have a poll right now going on in the YouTube chat uh to respond to that poll of what kind of mission you'd like to see in the future for Mars for instance um also if you have any questions for Dr Meyer please drop those in the chat as well and we'll add those to our Q for after we finish our our first part of our interview here today before we get to that don't forget the uh Emirates Mars mission absolutely yeah yeah the Hope Mission has been a fantastic Mission taking incredible pictures um I think it's also worth pointing out like Israel was the first nation to be successful um sending their first mission to Mars you know like NASA and early on you the Soviet Union and then Ros Cosmos we've had a lot of a lot of missions not making and a lot of issues over time and so we are at a point where we have great Engineers great scientists around the world sharing their expertise with each other so that we can have more successful missions from Nations that are developing their own space agencies it's very cool to see um and this might even kind of tie into that then my next question uh right now the NASA astrobiology program is convening a workshop that I'm part of many of us in the astrobiology community are part of on communicating discoveries in the search for life in the universe how do we share the these discoveries that we have in various ways from the Allen Hills meteorite um up through more recent stuff of like exploring the possibility of false fiend on Venus how will we communicate the potential first finding of Bio signatures on an exoplanet or the first possible sightings of some sign of Life on Mars and so it's really important that we we do a good job of communicating not just the science but also like the interpretations and and how we're getting there and I wonder kind of you know if you have a vision of maybe where things are working in communicating about these discoveries and where we could use some work yet and how we share about Mars exploration astrobiology uh with everyone around the world uh that's a really good question it it and it's it's one of those things where I've um kind of delved into it and then kind of went on to doing other things delve back into it to see if there's anything changed in five years type of thing um part of I I'll I'll say one well no the so one of the things I'm I'm proud of for NASA is they're they have worked into the ethic of the public needs to know what we're doing right so there's the I got a discovery you tell it you might wait a day to make sure that your Discovery is real so you don't like you know jerk around the the population in terms of what you thought was a discovery but the point is it's not don't keep it a secret it's not it it's not something we should be doing we should be proud of the work we're doing proud of the attempts of work that we're doing failures are also news and we shouldn't hide from them because it's a learning process so I very much feel that the only way to do this is to make sure that we have that we're upfront with what we're doing and we report out as soon as we have a reasonable idea that is real um our findings and that includes the prospect of finding life and and there I think right now NASA really enjoys a reputation for being upfront with what they're doing much more so than any other uh agency in the US and I think that's I think that's really critical and it's an important currency to take care of because as an example when we're bring samples back it's going to require a reasonable amount of trust from the from the public that we're going to do the right thing and we're going to tell them what we find this is this is not a secret and we're not going to hide things under the table so one is open communication and making sure that you know what we tell people is what we think we know and I think that how you do it could be you know that's going to change with time in terms of what what is how important social media do you have the president make the announcement all these and certainly you have a process where you want to make sure that those who need to make immediate decisions need to be aware be before Kaboom the news gets out and we kind of went through that process with alh84001 of making sure that the president knew before we had a press conference so other than that um I'll I'll touch a little bit is um we did look into how do you communicate and so there I'll I'll pick an example um when we talk about looking for life in other places and and the potential that life could have started somewhere else like on Mars or or on Europa we don't call it the second Genesis and and not that is potentially inaccurate um it's more of Genesis is a religious concept that's applicable to a good portion of the population in the world but not everybody and and what we should be doing is looking for whether or not life started somewhere else not overlaying it with some with a religious Viewpoint um and so so let's say making sure that we kind of go through those things and relay the facts without our uh our emotional biases in terms of how that affects our other beliefs I think is an important thing to do absolutely it's important for us to understand the the range of human belief and understanding to communicate together about our interest in exploration life detection and those kinds of things um I do want to jump to our audience poll real quick before we move to our next segment um our audience poll Dr Meyer we asked our audience who are watching right now that you know if they weren't if they weren't limited by funding what do they want to see happen in future Mars exploration and so we had a few answers AC said that they want a mission that includes liquid chromatography Mass spectroscopy um since the the pyes stuff just burns me up they say um rendering reality 3D animations wants more drones to cover further distances around the surface of Mars as May Kyper wants liquid analysis of Martian soils um to look for biomarkers Yan spacc uh wants the ALF uh instrument by Alpha Mars which is a group has proposed a specific life finding uh detector of their own um for you what do you think if you were not limited by money what do you think we should send to Mars next and uh wo that's a that's a um so this may sound boring but I think it would be tremendously exciting is multiple sample returns um and and the reason is is that when when you're doing remote science you see Mars globally so you can ask sort of um look for sake of analy single point questions globally you know for instance is there a water bearing mineral on Mars go around yeah you can answer that question but you're limited in what you can learn because of you're looking at everything globally when you pick a region you go there you're at a region that has a specific geologic history and when you take a sample you're taking a sample of a of a region that has a specific uh geologic history and part of our science process of picking samples is if this is the geologic history this is what we think and this is here's a sample that has the greatest likelihood of having evidence of life that's one you know that's one region that you just sampled and and then the problem is you may not actually have fully understood what that region was like and what was going on number two the Martians didn't read the book about where they should be living and so that sample may not be the best sample sample representing the region that maybe did have the potential of life but that's not the right sample so being able to do that in multiple places I think is really a great way to nail down not only the geologic history of Mars and history of the Interior but also the potential for life I love it reminds me of in science fiction like Star Trek and Star Wars and Stargate and all these shows they go to an alien planet and they they assume that all of the life all of the culture all of the things they find and the one place they go to is the way the entire rest of the planet is um which is not how Earth functions and so it's kind of silly to think that would happen elsewhere um I do want to jump to our next segment um but just real quick um you know you shared that you have been a scuba diver and involved in treasure hunting um we can also say that you know you were involved in you like cycling um but I'm also curious so you're also an apiarist uh you keep bees um what got you interested in beekeeping and made that you know part of your life uh basically when I was a graduate student a friend of mine got a job and he goes hey you want a beehive I said I don't know anything about bees he goes you don't need to know anything here and he gave me a beehive so I had bees when I was a graduate student and I thought it was really interesting and I didn't know any it they took care of those the bees didn't read any books and they knew what to do so it was really easy and then um basically I guess 20 years a little bit more than 20 years ago new parasites came to the United States and started uh really taking down the be population and you know me being a biologist said well you know one of the ways to help is to create genetic diversity and the bee industry itself doesn't help because they take all the bees ship them off to California to to pollinate almonds and then bring them all back so there's a real mixing of of the national gene pool for bees so I thought okay I'll just have a couple of bees on the on way Porch Step and so I started getting back into it and essentially I found it much harder than it was when I was a graduate because of because of the challenges the the per the pests that have been brought into the US and so that challenge has intrigued me and now that I'm retired I'll have the opportunity to actually do a good job and pay attention to bees and learn what I can and see if I can really um start doing some experiments and and improve B survival rates right now the B survival rates are about 50% in the across the country and huge variation between backyard beekeepers and Community uh commercial Enterprises so I find it is a really interesting Challenge and it's something that I could do on whatever level is I'm comfortable with so very cool um so I'm going to jump to our next segment now this is our faster than light segment intended for short 30 second responses um just for a little fun for our audience we love to ask this of all of our guests my first question is what is your favorite answer to ferm's question where are they yeah I mean it's a great question one fir me did the right thing they're all you know the numbers wise they should they're out there so what what's the story and so there I have two answers one is Space is really vast and covering that distance it takes a real miracle in terms of physics and we we hypothesize our ways to shorten the you know shorten the time it takes to cover those spaces but the other is aliens might not care you know it's going like ah so what you know they're off they found better worlds to explore kind of thing and and the third one which is you know favor of sci fi is yeah maybe they're they've already come and seen us multiple times and we just don't know yeah a lot of possibility um and also so why do we care my next question is what stories have inspired you to want to know more about the nature of life in the universe oh um that's it's kind of interesting one in that I I don't read a lot of scci Science Fiction but I do like it and so like the story of the foundation uh the trilogy really got me interested in terms of thinking about long term Vision thinking about U the evolution of Technology things about how to get out there um I I'm gonna go back to jacow in terms of part part of my interest and whether or not there's life out there is sort of a where is there life here on this planet and the fact that we don't know where it is in all the places and there might even be a crypto life something that started early on is not successful in our more benign environment really fascinates me in that in that we don't have a good idea of how life got started we don't know really what its true limits are so that kind of overall question is dripping sorry I'm going longer than 30 seconds no worri um so you know you had illustrious career you've been involved in so many missions and and programs with NASA if you could go back to the beginning of your career and give yourself some advice what would you say so um what I don't advertise very much is that I flunked out my first year in college and the reason is that I got to college I was doing okay I really enjoyed college for all the wrong reasons um but I didn't really have an idea of why I was there and and also is one of those things I felt like I had to be good at everything and it was daunting that some subjects were harder than others and and you know even if I tried hard I may not get an a kind of thing um so the advice would be you know figure out you know why do you want to make sure you know why you want to do it and then the second is is that you you can't be good at everything do do your best right make your efforts because what you're learning who knows when it's going to be useful whether or not you think it is useful today so and and luckily I I didn't like not going to college and went back and became a better student and uh figured out why I was interested in going to college and and found the science to be a good driver for how I want to live the rest of my life that's wonderful yeah we we all meet Ander in these different paths in our lives and the professions that we take now of course right now in astrobiology a lot of people are interested in exploring our solar system and elsewhere but the question for you in this segment if there is alien life out there do you think we're more likely to find it first in our own solar system or first from an exoplanet um so so okay here's the problem and the problem is um numbers versus information I we have an amazing number we have over what 5600 planets discovered already but we have no idea of how to look at those planets and tell us whether or not there's life there I I mean I'm I shouldn't be quite so dismissive but you know it's a it's a real problem you know we measure two different gases that mean there's life well according my theory it does according to somebody else's Theory it doesn't here in our solar system much fewer numbers of things that we think have the potential for life but we have a much greater opportunity of determining whether or not what we find really is evidence of life so I'm not answering your question that's okay um I will say so we do have a bunch of questions coming in from our audience and I apologize to the audience watching I will try my hardest to get to them as soon as I possibly can we'll start that here in just a moment but my next question Dr Meyer is also my most favorite of our faster than light segment what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind um the the closest extrasolar planet is a little over four light years away so there's two aspects of that one is the clo our closest neighbor has a planet right there's planets all over the place this that blows my mind and then if you do the numbers so and the numbers of you know look just for the sake of argument a 100 billion stars in the galaxy a 100 billion galaxies in the universe half of them have planets this is an unbelievable number of potential for life but the other is our nearest neighbors is four light years away it it goles the mind how far that is and so any chance of us going from the remote sensing stage to actually getting there we're going to need a mission that we're willing to wait centuries for the for the data to get back yeah it's all staggering when you think about it um I am gonna jump to our audience Q&A now we have a bunch of questions so I'll do my best to get to as many as I can here in the time that we have left first office from user AC they're curious uh why we wouldn't collect frozen water or frozen CO2 from Mars for a sample return and I imagine we would want to um can you speak to that the importance of maybe bringing back frozen water or CO2 from Mars so the there there's a a practical answer in that how do you keep it frozen during the whole process and and as an example right now we've had to put engine you know we've had to put temperature constraints on the samples in their Transit back to Earth and and what it looks like for almost all of it we'll keep it under 30° centigrade and this is a this is a challenge in of itself so keeping it at a frozen temperature certainly Frozen CO2 it would be extremely difficult you'd have to have a refrigeration process during the whole on whole way on samp return so it's right now at least it's almost impractical the second answer is what information would we actually really get from a Frozen ice sample or frozen CO2 sample Frozen you know dry ice sample that is more information Rich than bringing back a core so that's that's the other driver very intriguing uh Lindsey Hayes uh of the NASA astrobiology program and a previous guest of our show uh wants to know what is something during your career that you thought we would learn or do or discover that we didn't um so what did well I I put it more in terms of what didn't work and that was I was on DS2 which is a probe that that was supposed to be released from orbit and then plummet to Mars and make some measurements after it landed and it did not work on on uh Mars polar Lander for lots of reasons and we haven't tried it since and I think it's too bad because it's a great way to to cheaply in quotation marks get instruments across the planet and so because of that we we've never learned how to do that process so that's one of those things that it didn't it didn't work and because of that people are hesitant to try it again which is too bad indeed um user rendering reality 3D animations wants to know um your viewpoint on getting government appropriators motivated to fund long term exploration projects something like Mars sample return or technology demonstrations like Ingenuity um what does it take to motivate our legislators to be interested in our long term projects in space exploration I know that's probably a very big question I was gonna say if anybody has an answer that please let me know because we know we could use it it's you know you have to sell the vision right and then and then stay the course and that's that's uh two of those those two things are hard uh we for sample return is a great example of we've gone through uh two Century on two decades of trying to okay we should do SAP return and you know finally got it incorporated as part of what NASA is going to be doing but now it's maintaining that course in times of when funding gets tight or things don't go as you actually planned out which is typical so it's that's hard and I think part of it is oh I can say this you know the community can go and talk to their Congress people and tell them what's important and why it's important understanding that they may have a different perspective cool science has its own appeal but also jobs in their District Etc they they listen to that so part of it is that the science Community thinks it's interesting and ought to be funded their uh representativ should hear about it and it increases the odds that they'll vote the right way when the opportunity comes fantastic um so on kind of a similar vein to some degree uh our ambassador of the month Dr Jim pass asked on X uh that as an Astros sociologist he he considers the social sciences Humanities and these things and the relationships uh to space exploration so he wants to know of you how might sociologists and those doing more Humanities focused work bring in their Research into what we're doing right now in space exploration and astrobiology so I'll I'll say a couple of things one of the things we did early on in astrobiology is with the and I mention part of this is with the um uh American Association for the advancement of science we started a series of dialogues dialogues on science ethics and religion and basically things that we're touching on with astrobiology and sort of what's the original life uh what's the N nature of artificial life things how Society thinks about it we brought in people uh from different religions to help with that discussion uh it it's an it was an interesting series of workshops that's one of the things that we we did that early on and they're still doing some of that looking in terms of you know what astrobiology you're doing and what people might think about and what people might think of it might affect how what astrobiology is doing so that's one of them in terms of um social sciences I think of in terms of social interactions and a lot of that is let's say not directly in the purview of astrobiology but certainly our future as we look into human explorers it will play a huge role in terms of how people interact with each other and and the perception of things that are important for as people explore you know part of that a good example is Mars should it be a park you know should it be a uh you know a no trespass Zone except for very good scientific reasons or or is it a place where we would want humans exploring or tourists going and and I think that's a real ethical question that should be discussed before we actually get to the point where we've already missed a chance to make a decision that's very powerful and I think we're going to end there um so thank you so much Dr Meyer for joining us for this episode of ask an astrobiologist it's been a huge pleasure having you well I appreciate it very much gam thanks awesome and thank you to everyone tuning in and watching I know we had a lot more questions from our audience that I couldn't get to I apologize for that please reach out online and ask your questions and and let's continue the conversation else where um if you'd like to be our ambassador of the month next month just share about the show engage with us and share what we're doing we love to hear from all of you um if you'd like to to learn more about the Mars exploration program for instance from NASA you can check out mars. nasa.gov and of course uh if you are not already getting the emails from NASA astrobiology please sign up for the NASA astrobiology email list it's a way to learn about our show but also to hear about all of the awesome opportunities and events and all of the things that NASA astrobiology has going on it's a fantastic Resource as is the NASA astrobiology website and so thank you Dr Meyer for joining us thank you to our audience for watching thanks to all watching online on YouTube in the future from now uh so thank you and remember stay [Music] curious [Music] [Applause] [Music] a n
