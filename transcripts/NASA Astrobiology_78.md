if you could go back to the beginning of your career and give yourself some advice what would you say so one I don't advertise very much is that I flunked out my first year in college the reason is that I got to college I was doing okay I really enjoyed college for all the wrong reasons but I didn't really have an idea of why I was there and also it's one of those things I felt like I had to be good at everything and it was daunting that some subjects were harder than others and even if I tried hard I may not get an A Kind kind of thing so the advice would be make sure you know why you want to do it and then the second is is that you you can't be good at everything do your best right make your efforts because what you're learning who knows when it's going to be useful whether or not you think it is useful today luckily I didn't like not going to college and went back and became a better student and figured out why I was interested in going to college and and found the science to be a good driver for how I want to live the rest of my life
