because astrology perhaps more than any other field is this quest for understanding extraordinarily complex systems multivariate multi correlated variables in in living systems and the interaction of living systems with planetary environments and so on so if there was ever a problem that required the capabilities of sophisticated machine learning I think it's astrobiology there's ability of algorithms to program themselves to learn to find subtle correlations to find relationships that we humans even if we're trained May sometimes struggle to find and to also be agnostic to not come with too many preconceptions if we're careful in how we design and run our machine learning algorithms
