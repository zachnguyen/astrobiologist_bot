[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a [Music] greetings friends fellow earthlings and explorers of all ages and welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life as usual I'm your host Dr Graham Lao also known online as the cosmo biologist and we're brought to you by the NASA astrobiology program and net.org as always I want to send a huge thanks out there to all of you who are engaging live in the YouTube chat I see lots of wonderful comments coming in to those who are sharing about our show on Instagram and x and Facebook and Linkedin and Tik Tok and la la la la la all the different social media places thank you so much uh this month a special shout out to the user at asob biobuzz on X uh for sharing about our show I don't know who this person is I haven't met them I think in person but I should go wherever they are and buy them a cup of tea or a or their favorite beverage because they've been sharing about our show a lot engaging with our guests and I really appreciate that so thank you very much to all of you for tuning in now today's episode is going to be a romp through a lot of topics related to astrobiology and alien civilizations the future of our civilization the search for techno signatures and more joining me today is Dr Adam Frank Dr Frank earned his undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Colorado Boulder close to where I'm at as well as his master's and doctoral degrees in physics physics from the University of Washington uh in his main research after that he was focused kind of in the realm of the evolution of stars their birth their life their Fates but he's also done a lot of work not in just publishing lots and lots of scientific articles he's also written a lot about a myriad of topics in science fiction and Science and culture in a lot of different ways he's been an interviewed for many different kinds of newscast and television shows he was the science adviser for the Marvel movie doctor strange and among the books he's written is his newest book the little book of aliens which I was very excited to read this past weekend on a flight it's a fantastic read we're going to talk about that book a lot here in the the time we have together Dr Frank is now a leading expert in the world and technos signature research as well as in conceptual ideas in astrobiology So Adam thank you so much for joining me for asking astrobiologist thank you Graham it's a real pleasure I I love the work you guys do so it's a real honor to be here oh well thank you so much yeah Sean net.org and theas astrobiology program and we're doing a lot not just to fund and support a lot of astrobiology research but also to share all of the cool things going on across the world across the community in astrobiology now before we get started uh talking about your book and your work one thing I love for all of our guests to share is their origin story what turned them into a science superhero uh what really got you into science in the first place uh it was getting bitten by that radioactive spider no uh it was my dad's when I was 5 years old um I have this very clear memory of going into my dad's Library he was a writer and on you know I'm five years old so it was the lowest uh um shelf finding his uh pulp science fiction magazine so Isaac asanov astounding stories and others and on each one of those magazines there was a cover an illustration kind of lurid of either like you know people bouncing around on an alien planet in Michelin tire space suits or I remember one of like a guy know was a rocket that was you know the rocket was on and somebody had fallen into the exhaust and was getting you know fried and I was like but then there was also the buge eyed Monsters the alien monsters so that is what launched my career in astronomy my interest in astronomy and from five years old on there was nothing else I there was nothing else I wanted to do or could imagine myself doing and my dad was really cool that he took me he was interested in science and he would take me and my sister to the Muse uh Museum of Natural History in New York the Hayden Planetarium many many trips my sister was like oh God do we have to go there again but and that really fueled my um you my knowledge and my understanding and so was that that was where it began and all through high school I read huge amounts of Science Fiction I listened to Star Trek or watched Star Trek reruns back there in the 70s uh religiously every day twice a day there were two channels that they had reruns so uh science fiction played a big role also in shaping my scientific career very cool yeah I think you know science fiction dinosaurs aliens a lot of these like main themes I hear from a lot of our guests the things that inspired them and got them interested very early on um now your your research through undergrad grad school and know and kind of afterward was really focused more in the astrophysics kind of hard astrophysics realm understanding the fates of stars and their evolution what do you think kind of drove you into doing research on on Stellar Evolution well it was what happened was as often happens I think with people in graduate school is you you get there you know you're interested in something Astro I was actually a theoretical physicist I mean that was I was in the physics department at the University of Washington um and so you just look around for people to work with and who's got funding right that's often the you know it's it's a bit of an accident uh who actually has a position and I had talked with some people like doing black hole research and other things but uh there was I I met Bruce ballak who this book is dedicated to uh and he was doing work he was actually an observer doing work on what's called planetary nebula which are these end states of the end states of a star like the sun but they're the most beautiful objects in the sky right they're always the first thing when there's a new telescope that we take pictures of and I'm a very aesthetic guy and I've been you know really one of the things that drove me into astronomy was the pictures you know the pictures of nebula nebula always Drew my you know my aesthetic love uh and so his project was modeling that now he he couldn't do it because he's a you know he was an observer but he had collaborations with fluid dynamicists astrophysical fluid dynamicists people who studied gases in space and so I started working with him and I started learning fluid dynamics which is the such a beautiful Theory I mean the mathematics behind it's it's very visual it's also very technical um and the combination of those the the ability to actually hold in your head an image of this three dimensional process um and then having the equ the abstract equations that's what really it wasn't so much that I was so interested in Stellar evolution it's the fluid dynamics and the theory of it that really grabbed me um and yeah so that's where it started yeah very cool and you your career has taken you to various places you're now a professor at University of Rochester um you know going through this real you know from physics and you know computational kind of Realm you've also now published a lot of Articles kind of on more conceptual ideas in astrobiology in general um how have you seen your own career kind of shifting into this kind of Realm where you're you're kind of now doing all these conceptual things as well well you know one can say that tenure means never having to say you're sorry as you get old it's not just tenure but it's as you get older you know and you've sort of established yourself in uh you know uh you know more traditional Fields you kind of have a little bit more freedom to start exploring other domains now I always had an interest in philosophy so I was a philosophy minor in um uh undergraduate and the big questions are always what have drawn me you know when I first learned about quantum mechanics and its crazy interpretations that became a huge thing I was interested in the nature of you know just the I went into physics because of the nature of reality that's what I was interested in I wanted to understand like what's real what's truly real what's there when you're not looking at it so these other questions um particularly about life right and the possibilities of of of Life fit so cleanly into that idea of of the big questions right the really what is happening in the universe so as I got older um and and also what was great was astrobiology was not anymore it wasn't a fringe subject when I was coming up there was only seti and seti was still very marginalized you could not have a career in astronomy starting in seti or would have been very you were really taking a gamble so it was just you know because astrobiology was exploding I I wanted to find a way in and so the first project we actually did I started looking at exoplanet just exoplanet atmospheres um and there was a couple different projects we tried with our code the uh the fluid dynamics code that we were working with and the first one we wanted to look at the atmospheres of Jupiters how they you know the rotation the the exoplanet EXO hot Jupiters and our code turns out our code was the wrong code for it but then we found a problem where um uh the uh exoplanets can lose their atmospheres because of solar radiation they can just burn them off and that turns out to be a really important process so we started doing some papers on that and that so that was my entryway into astrobiology and then finally I was you know I was also doing a lot of popular writing and it was actually my work with national public radio that led me to start looking at astrobiology and the anthropos scene and climate change it was really struck me that you know climate change we're talking about it wrong it's really a problem in planetary Evolution and that is what launched that whole stream which is really what got me into sort of directly doing techno signatures and thinking about alien civilizations professionally oh very cool I love to remind people when it comes to climate change a lot of our understanding comes because of space exploration because of looking at at Venus for instance and its Runway Greenhouse Effect and having Earth observing satellites and then finding exoplanets that you know are super hot and close to their stars and and so I do love hearing that connection a lot um I do want to talk about your book the little book of aliens which I highly recommend it was a very fun read um this is kind of a book that covers a little bit of everything in the realm of astrobiology especially kind of the the more conceptual topics um and one quote that I wanted to share with the audience from the very beginning of the book you say that the human species is poised at the edge of its greatest and most important Journey um and I love that a lot for for where astrobiology is going it's kind of this realm of like understanding astrobiology understanding climate change and geoengineering understanding these these large scale things about you know back to philosophy why are we here what else is there what more might happen um we did ask our audience about some uh important milestones in astrobiology that you speak about in the book in various places such as you know the tree of life and understanding like the Miller Yuri experiment and how life can form extremophile organisms hydrothermal events and possibilities for life in oceans or exoplanet discoveries um our audence audience actually said that of all those options that extremophile organisms were their favorite um for the big milestones in astrobiology but if I had to press you a little bit what do you think in the last century is like the big milestone for astrobiology in general I think it's exoplanet it's the discovery of exoplanets like that changed everything right because if you look at the study right the the how people went about it what did we have like if prior to 1995 in the first discovery of exoplanets what did we have well we had seti but seti didn't know where to look and didn't you know and had a limited way of looking right we didn't you know we were pointing we were kind of doing random searches of stars or looking at sunlike stars and hoping for the best um and then there was the solar system studies and the solar system was really interesting but also there were kind of limited possibilities and then all of a sudden you end up finding out that every star in the sky hosts a family of Worlds and that one in five you go out and you count up five stars one of them has a planet orbiting the star in the Goldilocks or habitable zone and now suddenly like you had an exponential increase in the possibilities uh and then you add onto that the uh the the development of of atmospheric characterization techniques where we can actually tell what the atmospheres of these exoplanets are made of which is mindblowing um that's it like that's you know the the game has changed now we can look directly into the atmospheres of exoplanets and tell whether there's chemicals there that could only be put there by life or even technology so to me that's like that's the change that's like you know centuries from now people will look back at that moment and be like oh that's when suddenly the field matured yeah absolutely know sometimes you know people who are like 20 years old right now kind of take for granted that there's always been people in space living beyond the Earth and someone who's 30 years old might just take for granted that we we know of exoplanets as a young kid when I was a kid we didn't know of any at all and so it's made a big difference now I will say one more quote that I really loved in the book about exoplanets that you shared uh in your words there are places where winds blow through canyons and snow drifts across valleys and waves wash up on shorelines it's enough to blow open the horizons of your mind the added possibility that life and all of its creativity might have taken hold on some of them can give you a case of cosmic vertigo um I love that a lot this concept of cosmic vertigo can you expand on that a little bit what is that feeling that we have as a species well what I feel is again you know when people when we think about these planets to recognize that there are places that you can stand like you know the ones that are at terrestrial planets whether they have an atmosphere or not and they're you know to actually recognize that right now as you and I are talking there's all of these other places other stories like again the wind blowing down a valley that's a story that's something that's something that's happening somewhere and that there are hundreds of billions of these just in our galaxy alone makes you recognize that your story with whatever problems everybody's got problems but whatever problems you're having or whatever Joys you know Joys and Sorrows that there just one page in this very big book I think that's the vertigo but it's a good vertigo it's a it's a recognition that um you know we have a place in the universe but there's so much more going on uh that I I find that really um uplifting in a lot of ways yeah absolutely it impacts us a lot just thinking about what's possible and what what more might be out there for us as well um now we had another poll that we asked through the NASA astrobiology YouTube channel um about some technology that uh you talk about in the book these technological kind of Innovations and conceptual ideas um so like the Drake equation and Dyson spheres the cter chef scale and maybe other possible large scale kind of conceptual ideas in astrobiology and we asked the audience what is the most intriguing or influential of them and the Drake equation was easily the most favored by everyone um for giving us kind of this this way of having a thought experiment about the kinds of civilizations that might be out there um can you speak a bit to that the importance of the Drake equation for modern astrobiology and where we're going yeah it's kind of the foundation in a lot of ways and what's remarkable about the history of it is that Drake it was an agenda right was actually Drake is so Drake does this first study in 1960 the first astrobiology experiment ever I think people really need to understand that that project osma where Drake basically you know he got to use the SP the telescope the radio telescope to look at two different um uh stars for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence so it was the beginning of seti search for extraterrestrial intelligence but that was actually the first astrobiology experiment ever ever done the fact that he was looking for intelligent life doesn't take away from the fact that he was it was the first time we could actually do an observational test for life right so people shouldn't like lose that fact that that was the true beginning of of experimental quote unquote or observational astrobiology so um the next year he's asked by the government to host a meeting in interplanetary or Interstellar Communications whoa and uh you know he puts the meeting together there's a young Carl Sean who's going to be attending and uh he needs an agenda like okay what do going to talk about for three days and so he breaks the problem the pro what is the problem how many technological civilizations are there that we could talk to and he realizes okay I can break this problem up into seven different pieces and we'll talk about each sub problem right you know each sub problem becomes something you can think about and you can write that those sub problems as a an equation where it'll equal what the know each one of those sub problems the value you'll get will equal the answer to your question which is how many extraterrestrial intelligence there are and so there's seven factors one is how many stars are there next is what fraction of those stars have planets how many planets are in the habitable zone um of those planets that are in the habitable zone how many go on to make intelligence then how many or how many form life how many then go on to intelligence how many create civilizations and then the big one for us how long do their civilizations last so he basically gave us away to think about the problem and when you look at it what we see is that over the last since he did it three of those terms are nailed down so that we know how many stars there are in the galaxy they knew that but what they didn't know is the fraction of stars that had planets and how many planets are in the habitable zone so we've done you know he he laid out the course and we've been traveling down it and uh we've done pretty well yeah absolutely and there's still so much we don't know like how often does life emerge how often does life make intelligence I also agree that that last Factor the L factor is my favorite part of the equation I think uh given you know 1961 we were then becoming very aware of our capability of destroying ourselves uh we were still actively testing above ground nuclear weapons regularly at that point and it feels like sometimes we we we still face this all the time we still have nations with many nuclear weapons we're still seeing Warfare across the planet we're now facing these larger existential threats as well like climate change and our understanding of where technology May hinder us in the future um as well as benefiting us and so I I do like kind of enjoying like thinking about that L factor and what it means for alien civilizations I will say I had Susan Schneider on the show uh some years back and we were talking about this idea of the L factor and how short that lifetime might be for biological civilizations compared to post biological or machine civilizations uh do you think it's likely if we do start finding signs of Technology out there that they're more likely to come from post biological civilizations than biological ones I think it's I think it's a real possibility I mean the whole question of how long the biological era lasts you know I sort of have a chapter on that I do though I am not I am very skeptical of the idea that Consciousness can be downloaded into computers I we don't understand Consciousness we are not meet computers that's not my view so um so that's my that's the one place I'll have the sticking point I don't I mean I'm certainly not going to say that machines can't become sentient because I don't think I don't know um but uh I just want to be a little care that whole transhumanist idea that machines will wake up and they will I'm it's not clear to that that can happen but but I think it's certainly possible or that just what's left are you know what what what survives uh uh you know the evolution is is just our machines and there'll be no consciousness in them at all they'll just be kind of zombies you know fulfilling tasks but there's nobody in there which is kind of the most frightening Prospect yeah absolutely um I I will say so I me you know you have a lot of conceptual ideas in your book from kind of biological conceptual ideas you know Mill URI experiment and understanding ocean worlds and things like that um the whole way up to things like the Drake equation and then Dyson spheres the cter chef scale you also do engage a good bit with this concept of you know the UFOs UAP kind of are they visiting us now I will say for myself I found your approach to be one of the most cogent sober and maybe accessible approaches so I for the audience if you are interested in this topic and you want to kind of explore you know a rather unbiased approach to what you know has been offered so far it's there's a lot of good history in there as well um but you speak about this issue of the giggle Factor as you call it in the book that you know part of the issue with SEI early on getting funding for instance was the giggle Factor um and we had a lot of issues early on funding a lot of astrobiology relevant research uh can you speak to this what what is the giggle Factor well the giggle Factor was very much about linked to UFOs so I wanted to take on UFOs in the book because first of all lots of people are interested in them if you're talking about aliens you can't ignore the fact that there's this you know people have been talking about them forever there's this huge culture and now all since 2017 in those New York Times articles and the the Navy videos that it's just part of the popular Consciousness um I am very skeptical that any of this has anything to do with aliens but you know I think you always have to come to science with an agnostic approach so I'm all for an open scientific transparent investigation and let's see where it leads but the important thing for astrobiology was so as I show you know the first uh uh UFO Mass sighting or the thing that really started it was 1947 um already in that story you can see kind of the wackiness where like the uh the Kenneth Arnold saw you know had the sighting what he thought what he said what he was seeing were these sort of Crescent shaped things right and then there's the most famous misquote in history where the reporter who's asking him about it misquotes him as saying I saw a flying saucer and then the next day there's a new there's a a Chicago Sun article saying supersonic Flying Saucer seen in you know over Washington and within six months the whole world is or the whole country is seeing flying saucers he didn't see a flying saucer he saw a cresc so you see the whole power of narrative and and so the history of UFOs is one of there's people who are definitely just honestly interested in what's going on you know who are skeptical uh but there's also this long history of conspiracy theories unbelievably crappy data um and uh um uh you know hoaxes lots of hoaxes as well so because of that anybody who in science wanted to take on the question of life in the universe particularly intelligent on life in the universe you know eyebrows would get raised you know that Frank Drake Jill tartter they all had to suffer the giggle Factor like you brought this up and everyone's like oh life of the UN um and you see actually as I detail in the book this actually killed funding for seti there were in three separate times where NASA tried to provide seti with some funding because NASA was interested um and then somebody in Congress would stand up and say we're not going to fund a search for little greed men and literally you know put language in the Congress that would stop funding for for seti so NASA you know learned like look we're not gonna you know this is this is political Dynamite we're not going to do this again and so for a long time the giggle Factor basically stopped any funding for the search for particularly intelligent life I mean after the exoplanet Revolution you saw bi astrobiology growing thank God that was basically though the search for what I call dumb life right microbial life biospheres still you know we are the first like I'm the pi principal investigator of the first grant to do techno signatures on exoplanets and still I think we're they're like one of two or three grand so there still unfortunately is some of that giggle factor for techno signatures which makes no sense because if you're I me half the time you don't even have to do anything new to look for techno signatures it's just look in the same band that you already have you know so I I'm I I think that's beginning to go away but there still is if you just look at the portfolio of Grants it's still overwhelmingly there there's it's not overwhelming it's just that there's almost no techno signature so the the giggle Factor really adversely affected the whole search for Life still is there for but it's less so much less so for the search for intelligent life yeah absolutely I think we maybe should step back just a moment and maybe explain a bit about technos sign um you know we have this realm in astrobiology of looking for Bio signatures these these signs these you know patterns and structures that are produced by life and in some some cases people argue a real a real bio signature has to be only formed by life and not formed in other ways whereas there's some argument there but but bios signatures are signs of life and then within bios signatures we have this realm of technos Signature Signs of technological activity and development um that can range from you know getting a signal from space from an alien saying hi and what whatever language they use or us actually seeing an alien ship but there's also a lot of other possible techno signatures I wonder if you just briefly for the audience give us kind of a a Lowdown on what a techno signature is and what would constitute for us yeah I would say techno signatures is now for me that's the name of the field like seti there was classic seti which was great and there's amazing still things still going on in that with like what breakthrough listen is doing you know that's where you use a radio telescope and you're looking for anomalies or you're looking for actual messages but what is what the exoplanet Revolution made possible is just looking at planets with civilizations that are going about their business of civilization you don't have to care whether they're trying to contact you so um so examples of techno signatures are say one of the things that our group did chlorofluorocarbons right this is an industrial chemical can only be produced by industry that on Earth got you know at by mistake was put into the atmosphere we wrote a paper that showed you could find with the jwst with making a few assumptions you could find the spectral signature of chlorofluorocarbons in a planet that was 40 light years away at Earth levels of of chlorofluorocarbons if you get to five or 10 times the level then it really is a glaring signal so atmospheric pollutants whether they were put there by mistake or on purpose because chlorofluorocarbons are actually a great Greenhouse of gas and if you want to warm Mars up you'd fill it with chlorofluorocarbons so that's a techn signature atmospheric chemical um City Lights there's been a bunch of papers Thomas Bey did a nice one that showed that you would be able to see the um artificial illumination the nights side artificial illumination if it's there uh from an exoplanet um the there's a a solar panels any kind no matter how you build your solar panel the refle the reflected light would carry a signature in it that there was that you were using solar panels so those are my three most favorite another great one though that's really cool Jill Tarter came up with this if you're looking at had a a planetary system and you see four planets that all have the exact same climate right that's a techno signature right because odds are that's not going to happen that's telling you that you know some of those planets you know or three of them were were terraformed so these are the kinds of things we're exploring and that you know the field is just opening up NASA gave us this Grant and you know there was the recognition that we were going to be kind of trying to be the tip of the spear on this to systematize the ideas to build a library of techno signatures so it's very real it's so exciting like you know I get yeah I mean it's so fun to read in your book too about like the evolution of the field you know we're getting to this point now where technos signatures is a realm of study of of all these different possible things we might see for intelligence out there even though we still don't really quite know what intelligence is or what Consciousness is at least we can start looking for things that are relevant to the Realms of intelligence and Consciousness that we understand ourselves right now um and kind of in that vein so you've written a number of papers over the years um you written a lot for popular press but one of your research articles that really stuck out to me was one you co authored fairly recently with David grinspoon and Sarah Walker on intelligence as a planetary scale process um which I find really intriguing especially again we don't know exactly what intelligence is we see it amongst ourselves like oh yeah sure we're intelligent but then people still argue over whether animals have intelligence even though you obviously see it with some animals and so I wonder can you kind of give us the scope of what how would we view intelligence at the planetary scale yeah so this was I I got to tell you that was one of the most fun papers I ever wrote like just diving into that for two years I was working on it um and the idea was this came from my work in what I called the astrobiology of the anthropos scene like trying to understand climate change as a planetary phenomena because what we know is is we know that the biosphere and the other geospheres the atmosphere the the hydrosphere the cryosphere the lithosphere they've been co evolving right uh um for billions of years and the way to put it is that that as I like Sarah puts it this way you know life didn't happen on Earth it happened to Earth and you can say that should be probably for any Planet life is not some green Scruff that just is sort of sitting there on the edge of the planet you know nothing it does nothing else cares even but there's ideas that for a planet to remain inhabited you have to have life take over in some sense life hijacks the evolution of its planet now that you know in humanity has developed this thing called a technosphere right the sum total of our technology is affecting the planet in the same way that the biosphere is that's what climate change is about and so in this book what we were looking at was kind of this history of of you know how the Earth evolved and what we were is what we were as the question we were asking was whether or not the biosphere the mature biosphere like once it had been around long enough to really exert a potent influence on the rest really on the rest of the planet on in terms of hijacking the planet that is a network of coupled systems right an in highly complex Integrated Network of coupled systems um o again oceans life you know atmosphere should that be seen as cognitive in some sense right it's you just like people have been talking about forests right forests there's there's discussion about that the you shouldn't the trees aren't the organism the forest is the organism because of the connection between The Roots the Roots have these fungal connections that it's there's indications that like you know if part of the forest is undergoing stress they'll the rest of the trees will send nutrients to that part of the forest as if there was a slowth thinking Green Mind Right metaphorically right that so should we think of and we also have lots of there's a lot of discussion now but distributed intelligence right that the idea of like our kinds of brains are just one way of having intelligence ant colonies are distributed intelligence slime mod Ms can solve uh mazes right so we're just recognizing that there's solid brains like we have and there's liquid brains and that maybe the whole biosphere should be seen as a kind of in the Gan Theory like there's Gaia Theory which says that you know the the the Earth is a kind of um the Earth has exerted influences on the planet to maintain its own existence um and so maybe we should see the biosphere as a kind of cognitive distributed cognitive structure that helps maintain the planet in its you know in a state that is good for itself and the technosphere right the problem right now we have is we have a technosphere but it's an immature technosphere which is destroying itself it's destroying the conditions that it needs to maintain and so the next step just like the biosphere would would be to become a mature technosphere that supports its own conditions for its uh longevity so that's the whole idea of planetary intelligence was maybe the biosphere exhibits these uh I uh properties of planetary intelligence and we need to figure out how to make the technosphere have the same love it yeah that very much reminds me like Olaf stapon star maker this idea of like these conscious worlds and things like that um such cool stuff to talk about Adam I could talk with you for hours myself um but we do have other segments of the show including you know our Q&A for our audience who can ask questions right now in the YouTube chat live um but first we have our faster than light segment so our short answer segment okay and that's kind of fun just to ask a few really simple questions we ask everyone and we just like to see this variety of the different answers we get from everyone the first one speaks actually to you very well and and your your new book what is your favorite answer to ferm's question where are they yeah my favorite uh answer to that to the fmy Paradox is that there is no fmy Paradox and I want to be very clear about that because there's two fmy paradoxes the first one is are they why aren't they here now but the other one is oh we've listened and we haven't heard anything the great Sil and my answer to that is we really haven't listened SEI there's just been never been any money for SEI so we just really haven't started to search but now finally we are awesome yeah I agree entirely we really haven't even looked yet it's just a little bit of looking we've done so far we've barely started um now in the book I'll say you know as a nerd myself for all kinds of things in culture and sci fi and that kind of stuff like you have references illusion quotes from the big Labowski and dune hitchhiker guide from video games I mean there's a bunch of stuff in here for those who are nerdy like we are I would say but what would you say what are the stories that have inspired you the most to want to explore life in the universe well first of all as a kid at Star Trek the Original Series Star Trek Kirk is my captain I mean I love the other captains but Kirk was my captain um because it was on like endlessly when I was growing up in the 70s on re replay so I've seen every episode I don't know probably a hundred times at least um but more recently the expanse uh the the books and the TV show I can't can't recommend enough as I've written in a couple places it is the greatest science fiction show ever made and I stand by that really rich understanding of what a settled solar system what the next 300 years 500 years will look like for Humanity and then really interesting ideas about alien life and alien intelligence and what it can do yeah fantastic yeah I I love the expans series so much um I had a chance with with uh Ty and Daniel to watch the movie Alien once together with them um and hear their perspective of you know this idea of the expanse really was focusing on like the blue collar workers to start off with you know and kind of exploring you know their relationship to this you know world this universe changing phenomenon um so for my next question if you could go back in time to the beginning of your career and give yourself some advice what would you say chill out dude basically you know as I explained I you know there was there was nothing in my life that I could do except be an astronomer like you know some people need to be a dancer or a poet or I just there was nothing else I wanted to do but be a an astrophysicist and I just I worked so tirelessly and you know of course you have to to be an astronomer it's really hard work but I wish I could have if I could go back and be like yo man it's gonna be okay like you can work like maybe like five percent less and use some of that time to to take a walk or something um that's what I would tell myself or just have a little bit less anxiety about whether or not this is going to work out awesome love it uh um so you know we've done a lot in astrobiology already there's been you know these huge Milestones we've had from understanding potential for Life on Mars or even in Venus's atmosphere on the ocean worlds but also all of these exoplanets so if there is alien life out there do you think we're likely to find it first in our own solar system or on an exoplanet far away yeah that's a really hard question because they're both really interesting and they're both held a lot of possibilities on the solar system side you've got the fact that you know we're going to be landing on Mars soon digging in the soil looking for either existent organisms or the possibilities of evidence for previous organisms we've got all these ocean worlds which are mindblowing and we don't you know what's possible at the bottom of those or in those oceans but I still think if I had to put money down it's just the number of exoplanets and the number of possibilities I think we're going to find some kind of evidence for life some kind of Bio or techno signature before we get what we need from the solar system that's just a bet but you know yeah I don't know awesome um so what is something that excites you about the future um I think the most important thing I'm looking forward to is the settlement of the solar system I really think you know if we can as I like to say the solar system is the prize we win if we get through climate change and all the other ridiculous things that we're going through right now if we can manage to you know get through the wheels coming off the bus right now then you know the next 500,000 years what are we going to do we're going to we're going to settle every nook and cranny in the solar system and it's going to be amazing the the the experiments in democracy in different kinds of thriving human communities that are possible out there I think are going to be remarkable so that's what I'm really excited about awesome um this next question is my favorite of them all it's the last question in our faster than light segment what is an unbelievable science Factor that still blows your mind uh it is the fact that inside every one of your cells you have little uh molecular machines that are climbing ladders literally you know protein ladders and moving they're like tow trucks and they climb they move along those ladders and they carry big blobs of you know ATP with them um I think they're called actin machines and they're just you know you can find videos of them they are the most extraordinary device molecular devices and they're inside of every one of your cells the the the ability of life to innovate on a molecular level which is why any of us are here I think is just it's you know it's hard not to be in awe of it yeah we are incredible universes in and of ourselves right it's all this incredible stuff going on inside of our bodies um I do find it interesting that often when I have biologists on the show they love to remark about something out there in the cosmos and I have an astrophysicist on the show talking about biology uh it's kind of this intriguing you know thing just unfolding all these things we understand about ourselves um now before I go to the audience Q&A I do just have to ask for my own my own personal interest uh you were the science adviser on the Marvel movie Doctor Strange um can you just tell us what that was like and what kind of science you were advising on for the show yeah uh as I like to say Best Day Ever um so I've been a Marvel fan forever like I was you know as a kid I was a huge Marvel fan uh and so I was always really into it and then what what happened was the director Scott derkson who's an amazing guy really you know he's a he directs he's known for making these incredible horror movies or you know that's his genre but he also has a deep interest in uh religion or spirituality and Science and my first book was about science and human spirituality and it was through that somebody um uh we got in contact and we've been having an interesting conversation about it you know since then and when he was tapped to be the director he contacted me and said I'd like to suggest you know to Marvel that you be the science consultant I was like okay um and then nothing I didn't hear from him for a while and then I got an email I'll never forget that said Marvel wants to talk to you like ah so you know what happened is they um they gave me the script super secret right like I had to sign my life away that I wouldn't and and then they flew me out there and I spent a day with um Scott and John Spates and and even Kevin fi came in working through they had a couple of questions particular questions they wanted help with like one was there's that amazing scene when um Doctor Strange meets the ancient one and you know at first he's super skeptical she shows him you know these different maps of the human body one is like you know an fmri the next one is like chakras and he's being you know all sort of like smarmy and like I don't believe in that and they wanted to know what would he say like what would a scientist's reaction to this be and some of that dialogue straight on went into the movie which was awesome and then they were also in this was the beginning of the Marvel Multiverse right that was the first movie that had the now dominant Mar Marvel so we talked a lot about the Multiverse and how that figures and I'm not actually I'm not a big fan of the Multiverse I think I think it's fiction basically um but still we had lots of ideas about how it would work so it was all it was just so exciting and the best part was at some point you know Kevin Figi comes in you know this guy's responsible for 80 billion dollars of uh of movies you know and I shook his hand and said hey man I'm a fan I said I'm also a huge fan of Marvel and he said what's your favorite you know comic and because I'm such a nerd I could do the Deep dive there's like an issue of Star Lord from 1978 before Star Lord was it was a special edition and I named that one he was like oh yeah I was like yeah that's right baby super nerd here that's right I love it U that's fantastic yeah I think many of us you know who pursued careers in The Sciences were also inspired by you know a lot of these kinds of stories growing up from comic books and like video games um you know and and so a lot of us would love that experience of just having a chance to have some input on how to bring the science to the fun science fiction kind of ideas um so thank you so much for for talking with me but now it's time for some Q&A with our audience uh so they'll ask me questions and I'll bring them to you uh first off is one that came in the other day from LinkedIn from a colleague of mine uh Stephen paulway who he's really into space he loves talking to me about it he says he he finds it all inspiring and fascinating but he also feels like there might be little interest for exploring space and understanding about space amongst the average person and he wants to know maybe what your your perspective on why that might be is it about fear or feeling insignificant why does it seem like most people don't actually seem that invested well I think you know that's one of the reasons why aliens are so great because as the first line of my book says everybody loves aliens like you know there's almost nobody who is not interested in the possibility of life in the universe now normally that's going to be associated with UFOs and uaps but it's a great door opener to get people interested in you know the broader topics you know the thing is I think most people are living their lives right and they're concerned with the immediate you know with just getting through the day um and I think you know the job for like what you're doing you know and the job of those who who also are scientists and do science communication is to show people that actually this is part of this is part of their lives this is actually part and it can be as we talked about in the beginning it's actually something that will there's a spiritual component if for lack of a better word it opens your eyes it broadens your horizons it shows you that your little story is part of something much broader and I think that's the story that we need to show to people the problem is often science is presented as being this dry bunch of facts you know like a giant that's just picking up facts and we need to show people much more that it's it's a narrative it's a narrative about how the world is constructed and it's their world so good question yeah absolutely and uh taking part in our world is very important for all of us um we have a question from I might pronounce this and I apologize it's adab Burk keratos on YouTube adab Burk wants to know if it's possible to detect organic molecules in exit planets through light reflection like photos spectr spectroscopy um could this work like a biosensor um I'm guessing that they're kind of asking um with the light going through the exoplanet atmosphere if we can find organic molecules currently uh yeah sure methane I mean when you say organic I mean methane is organic chemistry right uh so we found methane so what was it k28 d8b which is this really cool new class of habitable planets called thean world and it's that means hydrogen ocean it's an entirely different kind of uh world it's like eight times the mass of Earth but they found like clear methane the the methane signal was five what we call five Sigma which means absolutely they found it so yes and so if you're but if you're asking about molecules that are associated with or you know organic life um depending on what the molecule is yeah we should be able to find that as well like the possibilities of finding a methyl sulfide which is the you know um what plankton in our atmosphere pardon my language fart into the atmosphere uh you know that's a real possibility that we'll be looking for so definitely we have the possibility for finding chemistry associated with life in Alien atmospheres very interesting um a question coming in from Manisha pahari um they're asking about if we can find or detect life like proar or like like a like a bacteria living on an exoplanet um compared to looking for technos signatures and I guess that really does go to looking at exoplanet atmospheres to see if we can find evidence of a biosphere um do you think it's even likely that we'll find evidence of maybe a less developed or or at least early stages of evolution type of biosphere especially if it's not interacting greatly with its atmosphere well that's the problem you've got to get it to interact with the it's got to you've got remember we we were just talking before about like an immature biosphere and a mature biosphere a mature biosphere is when those feedback loop the co evolution kicks in because that's when the biosphere is changing say the atmosphere but that should happen pretty quickly like you look at Earth's history and there were bio signatures kicking in pretty quickly um certainly after a billion years or so of of evolution so I think the possibility of seeing how microbes and mass affect a planet uh in a way that would be detectable I think Earth's history gives us really good evidence that that should happen pretty quickly and it certainly there will be detectable consequences absolutely there's a question here from uh Ann Sophie on YouTube he asks about the minerology of stars um in searching for possible planets they they say so looking at what minerals are found in stars and therefore maybe in planets I I want to start off there Annie or and Sophie and just say um the stars there there's so much energy so much pressure happening in these Stars there actually aren't minerals inside of the Stars everything's actually kind of separated into the the the the elements within the Stars the fuel the hydrogen the helium inside some some larger elements as well that are being fused together through this process of nuclear fusion and so we're not really looking for minerals on stars but there is an interesting kind of idea and I think I'll switch to that that Robert Hazen and some others at Carnegie and some other places have been discussing lately looking at Mineral evolution of planets and that maybe in a biolog olical world one that has a biosphere like ours we see this huge jump in the number of minerals available at the surface of the world and so Adam for you let's speculate a little bit do you think technological development itself will produce even another jump perhaps in the minerals that we might be able to find in a world or maybe even potentially detect as solid structures in an atmosphere one day that's interesting question but you know before we go there I do want to note there is this connection between the metals right there's not right there's no minerals in a star but it does seem like stars that have uh heavy metal what we call Metals now in astronomy a metal is anything heavier than helium so you know but that in general we do see a connection between having heavier elements in the star in its traces you know just in its the the elements floating around in the atmosphere and the the existence of planets so there is at least that connection um but I definitely think that the ter you're absolutely right the a Terra I mean a technosphere will probably reshape the planet's um the components of the planet certainly the surface components of the planet in ways that might even be detectable especially if you look at glint when we think about reflectivity right so one way PE glint is this idea that you should be able to see the reflection of oceans uh on exoplanets and be able to pick that up um and so maybe in some ways if they're you know if you are doing one idea that we're working on so a little back step is something that we're we are working on a paper now the idea of service worlds right that if you have you're in a solar system you you know you you know you're living on your planet but you got all these other planets that are uninhabitable maybe that's where you put your industry right and so it's a service world so you do you know maybe you like turn you glaze over the atmos or the the surface of a planet and and have wires attached to it so that the whole thing becomes a um solar collector right uh so service worlds might have very different minerology because we've done it on purpose for that and that would be detectable from a distance so yeah I think that's a real possibility that's very cool so like you know in our in our discussion here already we discussed the possibility for like using cfc's to to terraform Mars and so we have worlds where we're changing their climate but then there could also be worlds that are used specifically just for servicing for resources for another world like appendages of those those planetary intelligences reaching out and and adding in more I I love that idea and you're right I I do think it's important that we remember that those those more metal Rich stars in the astronomical sense are more likely to have you know more variety in the kinds of planets they might form in their star systems and so it's worth considering um we have a question coming in from one of our production assistants who I don't think she could help herself because she's also a fan of the expanse and so am I and amongst a lot of us interested in space exploration there's often this this discussion of of the Star Trek future versus the expans future kind of almost as a dichotomy you know because in the expanse you have there's you know cultural buding of heads there's almost you know an ethnic battle between the Martian and the the humans from Earth and and those out in the belt and then in Star Trek you kind of have more like this very socialist kind of future there's no money there's you know just just seeking progress together as a species but there still are philosophical issues and so I think Sarah wants to know what are your hopes for our future kind of in these Realms with Star Trek and the expanse uh well I think you know I am hopeful because what's the alternative um but I do think like I said I think climate change is ultimately going to force us to come up to have to you know you don't evolve unless there's a gun to your head right um You need evolutionary pressure I think uh ultimately the the stress from climate change is going to force us to change our understanding of how we structure Society things have got to change as I say the wheels are coming off the bus it's pretty obvious so there's a next step and I think that next step as I said will be the expansion into the solar system and one of the things I love about that is the idea we wrote a paper about how you could uh turn asteroids into space cities like you know you sort of if you just like the idea came from I wanted to see whether or not the idea in the expanse worked so can you spin up an asteroid hollow out an asteroid and spin it up turns out you can't because it'll break apart but then we came up with another idea about how actually to use that um to make a space City and I could imagine that there could be thousands of these space cities each having millions of people um and each one could be an experiment right they're far enough AP part that you know sure you want I'm sure there's going to be a Mormon Space City right and maybe you want a space city that is only some kind of free socialist Collective and you have another one that's just a Libertarian Paradise or an attempt at a liberan and I just think space is going to offer us the capacity to really carry out experiments in human thriving that wouldn't be possible if we're all just stuck on the planet that's a very cool idea just thinking about what's possible for the the great diversity of humans moving to different places and diversifying very greatly and what evolution might do in the long term both biological evolution and technological Evolution when you have those different experiments running um we do have an anonymous question that came in um concerning Uh current NASA missions future NASA NASA missions um are there any that you know you find the most exciting for your current or maybe even future work well I mean the big daddy is the habitable world's Observatory right so the the the the what will follow the James web Space Telescope is the habitable world's Observatory it's 20 years you know out right it takes that long to build one of these things but the excitement is in the name right that tells you right there what's amazing is that you know I'm old enough to remember when astrobiology was still there was no there was no astrobiology right there were no departments or grants really it was just you know there was this minor little thin thing happening um and so now with what the the habital worlds Observatory shows is that the entire astronomical Community is all in like this is seen as being the most important problem or one of the most important problems for astronomers to solve so that in itself shows you you know where we're at now there's other missions like you know the missions to the the ocean moons um Titan I think those are all really exciting but you know it's really the idea that the habitable world's Observatory is finally going to give us the kind of Technology we need to really find bios signatures very cool yeah I love Europe Clipper I love dragonfly and all the things that we doing in the solar system we need to get back to V person and get a more misss there a flagship Mission even out to Uranus and also Neptune both I think they both need Flagship missions um but there's so much more we can do but yeah like these telescopes are really unlocking so much more of the universe for us with James web Space Telescope this habital world Observatory that might be coming up in the future um one question from another one of our production assistants uh Mariam Nim wants to know what are the real challenges right now then that we can perceive in technos signature research and maybe how well equipped are our current or future telescopes for finding techno signatures well I think this is what's true for both bio and techno signatures are false positives right I mean you know uh as Sarah Walker says a molecule is not a bios signature right it's it's you need to understand the context of the world you need to take that signature and is it you know is it likely that this is the kind of world that is going to have what you need for life so you know in the for the in these early phases of the search our data is going to be you know so so it's going to be on we're always going to be on the Edge at least for the next you know 10 20 years of having the real the kind of data we want so it's going to be the interpretation and making sure we're not being fooled that is going to be the major challenge but we're getting better all the time I mean we you know there's a lot of smart people applying their smarts to this problem and just in the last few years watching the progress in both the bio signature and techn signature Community has been pretty stunning awesome um we have one more question coming in I think we'll end it with that question then um from Fel n day um they like the the Mars Trilogy uh Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy more in the expanse um and they want to know if you have any any opinion on that vision of technology and our future um I would also agree that I could easily put the Mars Trilogy above the expanse um because I also love it Kim I got I got a chance to go hiking with Kim Stanley Robinson which was also Best Day Ever what an amazing guy um I love the Mars Trilogy for and you know it's clear that the expanse comes from the Mars Trilogy right it's the you know it's that kind of vision of because it's it's a story of the um settlement of the solar system and really Kim Stanley Robinson in the 80s when he started writing that that was the era of cyber Punk nobody was doing what he was doing and so he was the one who turned almost single handedly got a science fiction to turn back to the solar system and start asking questions about what would a an inhabited solar system look like so I think his vision of the future is very exciting and very interesting obviously he was accelerating the time scale for um for uh uh for terraforming but I think yeah he was the pioneer of imagining what a settled solar system could look like yeah absolutely a lot of his later work has been focused on climate change and and what our very near future of our civilization and mid mid near future of our civilization might might look like so uh Adam thank you so much for for talking with us here on ask an astrobiologist sharing
