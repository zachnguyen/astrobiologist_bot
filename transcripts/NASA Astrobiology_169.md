what stories have inspired you to want to know more about life in the universe I wasn't a kid who grew up thinking oh I love science science is amazing um science was a course that I just kind of got through it was really in college I had this strong passion for for climate change right so I kind of thought about it from the political side but then I didn't want to just be a politician talking about science that I don't know or arguing against science I don't know so then I took some science courses and it's really looking back in time and seeing these things people discovered that a lot of times by accident or it's a lot of hard work we give credit to a single person but there's been so much research leading up to that so in in my lifetime even if I don't win a Nobel Prize the research I've done other people are building off it we're a community so I know I'm helping in some way
