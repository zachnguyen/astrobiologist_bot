how do you see your research impacting our search to understand worlds beyond the earth I started my career as an oceanographer and became an astrobiologist as a postdoc one thing that I noticed right away is how similar they are in the fact that they're both incredibly interdisciplinary oceanography and astrobiology really go well together like peanut butter and jelly just a match made in heaven we're thinking about things on a planetary scale that just really really really applies well to thinking about other worlds and in particular because the for life is the search for water so much of what we apply as oceanographers applies to the search for life on on other worlds and I think what's really interesting about this particular cruise is that normally you have a lot of oceanographers who are dabbling in astrobiology and here we have a science Crew That's primarily astrobiologists who we train to be oceanographers in the space of about a week so it's been an incredible experience
