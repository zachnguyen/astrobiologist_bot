[Music] in this lecture we consider interstellar travel we talked about communicating in the universe through electromagnetic radiation and the fact that intelligent civilizations are likely to communicate in this way because of its efficiency and the speed of light and other forms of waves but there's something vaguely unsatisfying about that passive mode of communication we might imagine that it's our destiny eventually to leave the planet and travel through the galaxy and we might imagine that a civilization with a head start on us or one that's had more time to evolve has achieved this capability too so it's worthwhile considering what it would take for us or for anyone to travel through space to actually colonize the galaxy or move directly into realms where they can find kinship among the stars the travel times in space are enormous the apollo 10 astronauts achieved the fastest speed humans have ever traveled reaching close to 40 000 kilometers per hour on the return trip from the moon in 1969. it seems an impressive speed but at that speed it would take over a hundred thousand years to meet proxima b around the proxima centauri star system which is the closest exoplanet that might be earth like to us it's otherwise undoable there's no way we can go fast enough because interstellar distances are so large we can't go fast enough unless we go close to the speed of light and that is physically not possible for large objects the energetic requirements are too large using these same numbers the fastest speed humans have ever traveled it's hundreds of thousands or millions of years to reach most of the earth like planets we found so far the need for speed was realized early on in the space program but there's a limit to what humans can withstand the g forces that some astronauts experienced in their launch and landing are tens and 25 or 30 is enough to kill a human being but aside from the limit of acceleration there's a practical limitation of humans simply not living long enough at the slow speeds we can manage in the solar system partly it's an issue of propulsion spacecraft engineers have made significant advances but it's even worth remembering than in the age of spacex and blue origins and the private space industry about to send humans into routine earth orbit the rockets have not changed substantially from the saturn v rocket that took astronauts to the moon we're still using same old technology actually very similar to used by robert goddard so almost a century old if propulsion technology is still using chemical energy which is tens of millions of times less efficient for example than fusion energy then we're going to be stuck in the solar system for a very long time we can get slight boosts from gravity and by being clever and in the space program by nasa we've used gravitational assist which essentially uses the gravitational energy and motion energy of fast moving astronomical objects like planets and moons to boost the speed of a spacecraft it's a clever trick that we've used to get space probes to the outer solar system relatively quickly and to eject some objects from the solar system entirely but it's not a routine way for us to leave the solar system and travel to the stars could we actually reach the speed of light if you extrapolate and trust the extrapolation if we achieved a roughly 17 fold improvement in our maximum velocity every half century or so humans might eventually in a few centuries achieve speeds of a few percent of the speed of light that would make interstellar travel feasible in a few generations but the implications of these calculations the extreme energy cost of moving a large object like a rocket or a human being to anything close to the speed of light or even five percent of it is that a new technology is needed that we haven't talked about so far it's the need to take humans into a state of suspended animation bringing down their body functions to a tiny fraction of their normal level so that they can re emerge after years or generations in a distant star system now during that time of course they would still have to be protected from cosmic rays and damaging radiation which would otherwise accumulate tissue and cell damage during the time they were frozen and such technologies for suspended animation simply don't exist right now in the medical profession there are rudiments of suspended animation technologies that exist the ability to place replaced blood with a body fluid that can be chilled remember because water expands when it freezes when a human is frozen their cells explode so you need to replace their body fluids with something like glycol and then taking the brain and the metabolism down to a tiny fraction of a percent is a job that can't be done without destroying the brain so at the moment the obstacles to suspended animation which is what would be required at the moment to send a starship to a distant star system are beyond us is that going to be true in a century we don't know meanwhile there's been interesting progress at the small end so if we set aside the idea of humans themselves traveling we could send space probes or emissaries and remember that may sound disappointing but that's what we do all the time we use technology as extensions of our capability spacecraft are already our eyes and ears traveling to mars in distant parts of the solar system or close to the sun they're essentially extensions of our senses and so we can use space probes in this way to explore large distances miniaturized space probes represent an interesting possibility and the project announced a couple of years ago breakthrough starshot which involved luminaries like stephen hawking and others is an initiative partly funded by the seti institute and yuri milner russian industrialist to explore methods of achieving if not near light speed travel than at least five or ten percent of the speed of light so it's the idea of miniaturized probes in the case of breakthrough star shot the idea is to have probes that weigh perhaps a billionth of a gram extremely small and yet have sensors in that miniaturized package attach them to solar sails and then propel the probes by shining radiation from incredibly powerful lasers on the earth's surface at the solar sails in theory and in principle such technology could accelerate those tiny probes nanobots if you like up to five or ten percent of the speed of light and at that speed to go to proxima century would take two generations 40 or 50 years breakthrough starshot lists a series of several dozen technical challenges required to do this project on their website none of them are impossible none of the challenges involve breaking the laws of physics but doing this project will take an enormous effort and far more than the money that has been committed so far but the idea that we're perhaps within reach of sending emissaries emissaries to a nearby star system that could contain an exo earth is incredibly exciting and it brings to mind another idea from the 1950s from a contemporary of fermi there's the idea of the von neumann machine johnny von neumann was a princeton professor founder of the field of computer science von neumann was aware that the miniaturization of technology even though computers in his day were the size of a family home might lead to the point where probes could be robotic and miniaturized he also realized that it was possible that such probes could land on asteroids or small rocky bodies and mine metals and materials to create replicas of themselves the von neumann machine is the idea of a miniaturized probe that passes through the solar system mines rocky and mental materials to make replicas of itself and then exponentially propagates through the galaxy making more and more copies of itself which send back the information at light speed if such technology existed in other hands it would actually take only a 10 million year period to explore the entire galaxy with these sentient probes beaming their information back to the home civilization has that ever happened in the history of the galaxy does the fact that we're within reach of that technology within maybe a century or so means something about the existence of life in the universe at this point we don't know the obstacle to us traveling in space as opposed to just communicating electromagnetic radiation is the difficulty of achieving high speed and the fact that humans are large objects and the energy cost of getting to even five or ten percent of the speed of light are prohibitive so at the moment we're stuck in the solar system without a new technology for suspended animation so that humans could be taken to a weight state for a multi generational trip to a nearby star this isn't going to happen anytime soon however the technology of miniaturizing probes and accelerating them with solar cells and pulsed lasers to significant fractions of the speed of light is doable and there's currently at least one project to try this either way it seems likely within a century we will leave the planet forever [Music] you
