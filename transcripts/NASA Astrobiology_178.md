[Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] greetings friends fellow earthlings and relatively large living things welcome to ask an astrobiologist the show that celebrates the science and celebrates the scientists involved in our quest to understand the nature of life I'm your host Dr Graham the cosmo biologist Lao and we're brought to you by the NASA astrobiology program and Sega net.org as always we want to thank all of you out there in the interwebs who share about our show who interact with our guests during the live stream we love highlighting the things that you do and the ways that you get involved in Sharing in this journey of astrobiology with all of us this month we want to highlight Conor J Ballard who is a PhD student in astrobiology and geology at University College of London for giving us a shout out on Twitter recently about our last month's episode it's always fun to have all of you engage in any ways you can I love engaging with you on any place in the social media realm out there and there are certainly a lot of social media places out there to engage with today's episode is going to be pretty exciting we're going down to the world of the small today the very small Our Guest for this episode is Dr Gary troubal and I'm so excited to finally have him on the show I've been thinking about having him here for a while but he just recently had a new paper published and that made me think well it's time we have to have him on the show uh Dr Trubel earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Arizona in environmental sciences and then earned a master's degree in environmental science and health at the University of Nevada in Reno while also working at the desert Research Institute where he was doing some research into determining the origin of n2o in Lake Vita Brian's in Antarctica uh Dr trubo then went on to his PhD in microbiology at the Ohio State University where he worked on characterizing viruses and Arctic peatlands along a permafrost thaw gradient to understand their roles in permafrost thaw and ecosystem carbon processing all very cool research of course Dr trible then went on to do his postdoc in his now a research staff scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory his ongoing research here Gary's using multiple meta omic approaches like metagenomics and meta transcriptomics and viromics in combination with stable isotopes and radioisotope probing to better understand the mechanisms that viruses use to control microbial physiology and to quantify nutrient exchanges in soils so I'm so excited to have him join us Gary thanks so much for joining us here and ask an astrobiologist hi thanks for having me on uh like I said I've been you know kind of wanting you on the show for a while I've been super excited about the work you've done uh you hosted a NASA astrobiology Institute Workshop some years back on this realm of Astro virology and so today we're going to talk a lot about viruses what they are your research and viruses and astrovirology but before we get there I always love for our guests to share kind of their their pathway their their science origin story that has brought them to where they are uh would you mind laying out for us what the moment was for you where you realized this was going to be your career yeah that's tricky I don't know if there was just a single moment or accumulation of many moments you know when I went in to do my undergrad I had no idea what I wanted to do I tried veterinary science I tried political science I helped around environmental science kind of spanned everything and you could focus in different areas so I kind of went with that and that was enjoyable I got involved in undergrad research lab which really helped me go to graduate school during my grad school I started tinking around I realized I like cold environments I like extreme stuff like what are the limits of life so I started working in Antarctic research and I enjoyed that but then I really wanted to know what's all this new meta omics of this out there there was barely any courses when I was an undergrad so then I moved on to do a PhD using those tools during my PhD I was working on a permafrostolic gradient I was originally going to look at the bacteria in archaea but then I came across Maya bright Parts 2012 paper Marine viruses truth or dare and that that maybe if you're going to talk about one moment that was the paper that just changed my life forever it is captivating it's engaging it's well written and it's even got these great cartoons that really show you why viruses are important and before that I had not taken a virology course but I took a microbiology course and you know you learn about human viruses HIV herpes kind of boring I I didn't really find them too exciting right I wanted to know about ecology how they interact with everything around them and I didn't really know this was possible but then after reading Maya's paper I was hooked oh very cool and I feel like you know our understanding of the biological realm around us of course it's evolved over time but understanding viruses in their roles feels like a fairly new thing uh compared to you know understanding microorganisms um you know other things like bacteria and archaea or understanding larger creatures like plants animals and fungi you know it's viruses are so small it seems like it's just taken us a long time to really engage with our understanding of them yeah I think that's exactly right I mean if we go back 30 40 years ago what we're talking about for viruses was the same for microbes right we were just figuring out oh archaea is a thing that's Eubacteria what's going on with that and I think in 20 30 years from now it's going to be the next smallest thing right so it's it's great how our tools are progressing and allowing us to see even smaller things each year absolutely and it's you know science has unlocked scales of time and space for us that we did not evolve to think about uh quite honestly uh and then our knowledge you know an astrobiology our knowledge is evolving of what life even really is or how to characterize life uh I did put up a poll on my own Twitter account last night just asking the question that I'm sure you get all the time our virus is alive and of the answers of you know yes no maybe or what's a virus um about 60 almost 60 percent of the respondents said maybe a little bit of both maybe alive and not alive um I wonder if you can give us a little virology 101 of what our current knowledges of viruses and how they they interact with the environment of course so I want I appreciate you putting that out there and I appreciate you even giving the option of more than a yes or no because as we're seeing with life everything's a spectrum there's no block there's no white it's all the Spectrum for everything that comes to do with Biology so I do get that question a lot and it's somewhat frustrating and the reason why it's frustrating is we still don't have a definition of what life is we have working definition for something we may see but if you actually look at the support for it it continuously changes if you think about all right what are the characteristics of life well they have to grow crystals grow they're not life right so what exactly is needed and currently we have the tree of life which is based on you know a set of marker genes and currently viruses don't have or we haven't found a virus I wouldn't say they do though um to have this marker Gene so they're not included in the in the tree of life but to say viruses are alive or not is it's just it's interesting because if we went to another planet and we found a virus would we really argue that there's not life there so if we talk about the things we know about viruses they need a host so if we found a virus we know there has to be a host nearby viruses themselves don't have metabolism so maybe if we look at the virus particle itself so we call it a virium it's when you hear the virus shape and then you also have nucleic acid which can be DNA or RNA maybe it's not active in that state right there's not generation of ATP but sure enough when it infects a host it takes advantage of those it reprograms host it uses the host metabolic machinery and it does what the virus wants so at that point it must be the virus right the virus is now alive so I would definitely argue a little bit of both and just to say a hard no or hard yes is is hard to say that's awesome yeah and I will say some of the commenters on that post they brought up exactly things like that we had a conversation about information Theory and whether we should be characterizing life by how it how it stores and transfers information which viruses most certainly do and then one person even mentioned you know like that would you know the viruses might not be alive and I I did pose that question what happens if we find a viral particle on Mars um even though it doesn't no it doesn't show us the cell that it could be infecting I think a lot of us would argue that counts as a life detection um and so yeah there's a lot for us to explore there and to learn about viruses now I think you know you mentioned earlier kind of how a lot of our thinking about viruses especially you know with the recent coronavirus pandemic that we've all suffered through together um we all know about things like you know HIV and some of these other viruses that infect humans and cause you know everything colds all kinds of stuff but you know we don't think as often about the other kinds of viruses that are out there and how they are involved in the environment that's been more of your research I wonder if you can give us kind of your vision of of viruses as they are involved in in the environment in an ecological kind of sense here on Earth yeah and that's exactly what got me excited about viruses it's not that I don't care about humans it's just that we're looking at the minority of ours is because we're human centric right we care about things that are relevant to us and that makes sense but if we look at what the majority of viruses are out there it's such a diverse term and and what I've spent most of my time studying are actually bacteriophage which are viruses that kill bacteria and there's more bacteriophage than there are of any other type of virus out there right you have bacteriophage you have viruses all over you and I like to say viruses as a loose term because there's so many other viruses there's microviruses which are viruses infect fungi are teal viruses anything out there gets infected by a virus including viruses themselves so when we're thinking about you know oh viruses bad viruses is good that's not how it is we have to think about the ecology everything about the ecosystem what are they all doing They're all playing a component in the ecosystem right and so I like to think of things at a systems level and I started going with soils because soils are arguably the most diverse system out there and they are really tough to sort to study and I love it though because we can interact with soil we grow up with soil it's all around us there's so many ecosystem processes that soils gives us and in soils it's not just one thing is doing this it's this affecting this affecting this there's a Cascade of effects and we need to know how they all interact as an ecosystem as a whole and this is part of the reason why I use the metagenomics The Meta transcriptomics and to give everyone a background this is where instead of looking at an ecosystem we're not pulling out one bug and saying hey what are you doing we are extracting nucleic acid so DNA from metagenome or RNA for metatrine crypto of the environment so we take one sample we have some soil here we extract all of the DNA out when we extract that DNA we sequence it so we can put on the computer and see what each individual does and we have to bring them back and reconstruct their genomes and then we figure out how they're interacting and we can't just look at DNA alone because DNA tells us what is the Baseline what's the potential what do they encode what can they possibly do not that they do it though The Meta transcriptomes is when we start looking at RNA so we have to go from DNA to RNA so RNA shows hey this is metabolism that's happening right but we also kind of pre to pre uh preempt things right so a great example would be in soils when it's going to rain right when the rain is about to happen you smell that especially if you're in a desert environment a group in Arizona I love the smell of the desert before during and after a rain that that Jasmine smells so good that dirt smell um so the microbes get ready right they start chugging out aren't mRNA which is the messenger RNA they're getting ready if it's going to rain sometimes it doesn't rain or it's not going to rain where they are so then we look at meta proteomics these are all the proteins to show okay something that actually happened right we had a protein that was produced now we can arguably say that it had to happen because if a cell is making a protein and it doesn't use it that's exhausting that's a lot of energy where mrnas like chunk change so we can make mRNA but then to make proteins you really need to hope it happens but if you want to be sure then we can go into meta metabolismics which is where we're looking at the metabolites the interactions with these proteins and so cool and like you know the knowledge that we have to even do this is evolving rapidly right now I remember when I was earning my my bachelor's degree in biology we were at the place of doing meta transcriptomics or meta metabolomics at that point those things have really been evolving over the last 20 some years um to allow us to do this now and to look into the environment and see these things I will mention another poll that we did through the NASA astrobiology YouTube channel just yesterday um asking people about the scale of viruses in the environment uh there are more viruses than stars in our known universe uh an estimated 10 nonillion viruses here on Earth um but they only make up a very small percentage of the total biomass uh so we gave the audience some some options for possible biomass fourteen percent four percent zero point four percent or point zero four percent uh the correct answer was point four percent um so they are a very small amount of the biomass even though there is so many of them and thanks to things like the work you're doing with you know not just the metagenomics but also transcriptomics and metabolomics kind of understanding uh what they're producing in the environment around them um well what the bacteria are producing in the environment around them and how the viruses are involved in that um from all of this what do you think is the most misunderstood thing about viruses and their behavior maybe especially in the environment yeah it's hard to pin it down to one thing um so if we talk about the general public I think most people think that viruses aren't really interacting with the environment that they are moving to the environment this environments just the medium there's no interactions and they're making their way to a human to hurt a human um and then if we think about scientist level it's more of ah viruses are really hard right we're talking about photograms of DNA we're talking about particles that on a nanometer scale right so really hard to get at and science is already hard and we critique ourselves so hard I mean the peer review process is strong and that's exactly what we want so we tend not to go for the hardest thing possible even though that's kind of what I did uh so I think there's there's a a misunderstanding is that if we can just ignore the viruses and we can describe our system and that's fine that it's it's can be described without the viruses and that's just not true hmm interesting yeah I feel like you know from my own understanding I really haven't thought that much about viruses in the environment um especially things you mentioned like bacteriophages are the most abundant of the viruses out there um I had another poll I asked people in my Twitter account um what were the most abundant viruses and luckily most of the respondents 75 percent got it right and said bacteriophages um I want to present kind of a Sci Fi idea to you and tell me if it's just bogus and silly or not um because you've done work in studying viruses and permafrost and polar regions there was a science fiction horror film some years back called the thaw that presented this idea that maybe during you know current issues with global climate change and global warming with the glaciers receding and permafrost thawing there could be organisms that you know have been isolated for thousands of years that could harm humans or other creatures is it possible for there to be like old viruses that infected humans long ago that could be buried permafrost and could still infect us in the future yeah that that's actually a question I get a lot especially with the with the recent pandemic um so this is tricky right we only know what we know but what I will say is viruses tend to be where the host is right so when humans are sick viruses around humans right that that's what we look for so if we want to look for a human if you want to look for a human virus you go to a human that's sick you'll find that virus so with permafrost so just to give some context on permafrost I appreciate you using the word thought and not the word melt because it's like a chicken when you pull out of the freezer the chicken doesn't melt it doesn't change right the ice within it melts right but the chicken itself is Thigh so we have the chicken there so permafrost is like that we'll look at it as frozen ground and it can have ice within it for a virus to be there for a human that means humans would have to be there as well so if there were humans that were sick with viruses long ago and they got entrapped in the permafrost then there could be human viruses the problem is the viruses need to replicate and each virus itself is it's different how persistent it can be how long it could start how long before the capsule gets degraded right so within a human that could probably last a bit longer than the environment if we think about putting a human virus in the environment that's when it gets tricky then you're in an unknown habitat this is like us on the moon right so it's going to be it's going to change what I would say is that we for sure will find bacteriophage because there's bacteria and permafrost we find giant viruses that infect amoeba and permafrost because the amoeba used to be there thousands of years ago we actually wrote a review about this that came out last year talking about the potential for permafrost to be a reservoir for pathogens and you know that's a great question because for other pathogens it can be so we think of bacteria like anthrax itself it's a normal soil bacterium when it becomes a problem is if it's like an animal carcass that gets entrapped in the permafrost right and when that thoughts that's something that we have to worry about if we're going to worry about human viruses we would need to worry about maybe people who were infected with a virus if they were buried and their body was preserved and you came around the body so just to protect yourself if you're ever in an icy area and you come across the body don't touch it Don't Go Near it um but I'm not aware of a case where somebody's got sick from a virus from permafrost that's good to know so maybe I shouldn't lose sleep over it just yet um so you know all of this is fantastic and you mentioned you know like could viruses infect us on the moon you know and we talked earlier about whether or not we find a virus on Mars is that a sign of Life uh you just LED this paper called astrovirology how viruses enhance our understanding of life in the universe it was published in the international Journal of astrobiology for those who want to read more about viruses and this realm this new realm of astrovirology I highly recommend that paper um it feels like a really great way to kind of introduce viruses as being important to astrobiology and our our sheer understanding of what life is and how life might function uh can you kind of give our audience basically an overview of what you mean when you say astrovirology yeah so first I might give some context if you want to access that paper go ahead I always try to publish an Open Access which means that you don't have to pay for right we do this work for government tax dollars we want to make sure you can be able to read it so we can disseminate the science throughout the public now when it comes to astrobiology it's kind of a catchy term really you know understanding astrobiology is a study of life in the universe and Earth is part of life in the universe so everyone who studies life on Earth is an astrobiologist we're asking the same questions right whether you're focused just on Earth the potential for going into space in the space environment whether it's on another Celestial body those are you're asking similar questions persistence interactions survivability um adaptation right these are all things we're thinking about so when I say Astro Violet virology it's really to put the emphasis on viruses because they've been largely unexplored especially in our understanding of wanting to go into space but they're critical so in the paper and and this was a symphony paper right I was the the conductor and we had so many scientists that helped out different experts in different areas so I am by all means not an expert and every individual area so I'll answer the questions the best that I can but we really thought about okay well how do viruses change life on Earth and how do they interact with life on Earth what about for people going this space because now we're just gonna we're getting to the point where anyone can go into space so what's happening there then if we think about long term space travel how do we make sure we have recycling food our waste our water viruses infect everything so we need to think about them and I just want to highlight this uh to give everyone a better understanding of viruses because I'm saying viruses you probably are thinking of a cold you had once or if you had covet or or something else and how virus can be so different does one you can get sick with and be sick for the rest of your life or it re emerge later like with shingles and chickenpox and then there's other viruses we just have a cold and you're fine so viruses even though they're small they're Mighty and complex and we think of three iconic ways in which they can really make an impact and this is all stuff I'm still in from my parts paper uh I love it she knows this I've told her and I'll just keep sharing it uh so in the first form right we have viruses it's this Grim Reaper this is because they're lysine their host whether you're multicellular and they're killing cells or you're single cellular like a bacterium and archaea they're slicing you they're killing you right and this is releasing your nutrients into the environment so they're stopping your metabolism that's impacting the environment they're releasing your juicy innards into environment feeding other organisms right and that's impacting the environment as well when they do this they promote diversity because they like to attack the one that's winning the most abundant organism so by doing that they're sharing the wealth they're kind of the Robin Hood they're sharing the wealth with everybody else keeping this diversity so viruses are great for diversity their second is as a drug dealer where when they infect hosts they share genes right so transduction is the mode in which viruses infecticell takes some DNA in fact a new cell give some DNA so they're moving genes around they're giving genetic novelty out there and they're spreading the wealth and the final form is kind of as a wizard so when a virus infects an organism and this is when we get into saying if our virus is alive or not right so virus cell is this concept where when the virus infects the host the virus is it is the one taking over is the host now right so if we talk about that biomass question it becomes a little controversial we start counting that as viral viral Maps but uh we won't have to get into that but as the wizard right when the virus is infecting the hose it's wanting the host to do its bidding so the host is no longer putting out this metabolic outputs is no longer producing it's no longer aspiring releasing CO2 or photosynthesizing releasing oxygen unless the virus wants it to some viruses just say hey make my progeny viruses and then you'll explode and die other viruses continue to control the metabolism they can make it more efficient make them more fit there's so many different things that viruses can do so they have a large impact on our Earth and on the evolution of life um it's really cool to think of them in these different ways as well I wonder from my own edification to my knowledge we don't really know when viruses started were they here with life since the beginning or did they evolve two billion years ago or 500 million years ago do we have any way of knowing yet when viruses joined the living processes of life like here on Earth that's extremely hard so thanks thanks for throwing the hardest question out there we have evidence that viruses are still emerging now right so if we think of the earth geologic time so 4.5 to 4.6 billion years ago and we think life arose around 3.8 billion years ago give or take with our our knowledge um there's many different High policies out there if you think of the one that's the virus first hypothesis uh this is kind of from simple to extravagant kind of hypothesis where at first we have oh maybe it's some RNA and then we have some DNA and then we have some amino acids that form around that well that's technically a virus right there and then if you go up and evolve from that right so there's one hypothesis there there's other ones that make it hard to identify whether viruses were there or not and I think the reason is we don't have like this this Luca this last common ancestor for viruses and because viruses are in different groups we have our RNA viruses which a lot of them share a specific Gene some don't our DNA viruses you can have this group that shares a gene because it's if you think about their shape they're like oh this part of my my head my cap said we share this Gene we're clustered together but we don't have a universal marker Gene so it's really hard to go back in time with our molecular clock and really see when viruses emerge we have evidence of ancient viruses there's work especially in the oceans showing that maybe there was that Missing Link from the RNA to DNA world but then there's evidence showing with eukaryotes we have viruses emerging and coming from eukaryotes so it's a tricky question and to answer we really need to look more we need to look further I like for me I would love to sample the Deep oceans and the Deep sediments and in the deep Earth to really see if we can have these ancient preserved viruses to try to get at that last Universal common ancestor for viruses all right that's such a cool answer and I can say we have some questions coming in from our audience already on YouTube uh thanks to those who are asking I promise I'll get to your questions very soon uh I know that we have one kind of similar to that already um before we get there I do love just sharing a little bit of what makes us all human as scientists and engineers and researchers as well you mentioned to us that that trail running is one thing that you're really into I'm wondering you know so so why trail riding what does that do for you to help you kind of get yourself into a better place um how is that kind of part of your life yeah so I am somebody that wears my emotions on my sleeve right I really care what other people think and it's because we're humans right I value other people and I want them to Value me so running is just a great way for me to get out it's my time I'm forced to just focus on me and sometimes it's boring right sometimes if I'm having a rough day I am bored and it's not going to be that long of a run but it helps me focus on me it helps me get this energy out and I love exploring and seeing new things right when you are in a treadmill you're stuck in one place but when you go out there could be something different you could run into a snake uh you could run into a super bloom right there you never know what you're going to see when you get out there and that's exciting I love that yeah and I have to say like for me like I love if you're trying for a walk and just like speaking to myself and telling myself the things I want to think about I even use like otter AI to like download it and transcribe it for me um it's a great way to get exercise and do some science at the same time okay we are going to do just really quick our faster than light segment this is where I I ask some very simple questions for short answers from you um our audience loves to hear it I love to hear it so let's get going with those what is your favorite answer to fermi's question where are they I would say we don't know we don't know we haven't explored enough and we are looking based on what we know and not what we don't know so we have no idea what we're necessarily looking for oh I like that and so I mean I'm a huge science fiction nerd you know I brought the fall earlier even you speaking about you know some of these things viruses do made me think of the thing um and some of these other stories I love what stories have inspired you to want to know more about life in the universe yeah uh so biology is hard and just exciting it's not like other Sciences where you see something you'll see it we take technical biological replicates we still get some different answers we have to do so many studies and in this case I'll do this in this case it's just that so I think the stories that excite me is when there's brand new research that comes out that just makes everyone go gasp oh and then you can literally find out five minutes later just kidding that was not a thing or I was an nf2 or we found it it doesn't always happen right so that's that's kind of exciting um I also get really excited when people are First Learning and you see that spark where something excites them and in their head for at least five months that's what they're doing that's what they're going to be doing they're sure of it right so that I feed off that that's exciting to to see and to see people passionate about stuff um for science in general though I wasn't a kid who grew up thinking oh I love science science is amazing um science was a course that I just kind of got through um it was really in college uh I had this strong passion for for climate change right so I kind of thought about it from the political side but then I didn't want to just be a politician talking about science that I don't know or arguing against sign someone else so then I took some science courses and it's really looking back in time and seeing these things people discovered that a lot of times by accident or it's a lot of hard work we give credit to a single person but there's been so much research leading up to that so in in my lifetime even if I don't want a Nobel Prize the research I've done other people are building off it we're a community so I know I'm helping in some way I love that yeah no worries um I agree with that spark that you see in people's eyes when they learn something new and it's it's this fun discussion this conversation that we have where we learn something together and that's part of the human endeavor of Science and learning if you could go back to the beginning of your career and and give yourself some advice what would you say um encase yourself in a suit of armor uh life is hard and going through college so when I say college this can be anything trade schools included a university is just a collection of colleges um you learn things right and people offer their opinions for you to learn and then you have to learn what you're told to learn and it may be a little bit different depending on where you are but then you go into grad school and it gets even harder because you're not only supposed to learn but then you're supposed to add now you have to contribute to science and to make science valid fair and Equitable we have to make sure that we're arguing with each other there's a peer review process that science needs to go through so we get attacked all the time and it kind of makes us hard and really getting back in tune finding ourselves making sure we have hobbies making sure we can relate to people still and not become hard um I would say for a lot of people graduate school as a really hard time myself included so I would if I could just go back I know I'd trust myself and say hey you're going to get through this you can do it's all about perseverance persistence right you don't have to be the best person out there you just keep trying it's fantastic you know I myself I think a lot right now where AI is at right now with all this generative AI going on like Chachi PT and Bard you know and we just had this recent test of Starship from SpaceX there's so much going on right now in our world with science and technology things are progressing very quickly and I'd say right now if you go through any social media site there's you know kind of some pessimism right now about what the future might hold for our species but it also feels like there should be a lot for us to be excited about so I wonder from you um what's something that excites you about the future yeah this is hard as you get older when you're a kid everything excites you right we have our creativity our imagination is huge uh I think talking with older Generations can be helpful like a lot of times we'll brush things off but if you really listen You'll see the problems we have now are problems we've always had has always been the pessimism there's always been the excitement and you realize always just something new um so what excites me is that for science in general we're moving to a lot of inner to dinner interdisciplinary science we're working together I no longer have to be an expert on this one gene that does this this person no longer has to do that right we can start to understand these fields and come together just like the paper we published where we're all experts in different areas we were able to unite on a topic that we agree on we could argue we could debate and we have something to show of our works of working together and I think that's something we need to really think about and excites me for future this idea that science has been in a way where we're United against the science we're seeing more and more proposals some calls for us coming together not just this person can do this but really looking at a system right and that's been that's been the Crux of my research since the beginning I've always wanted to look at the system so the merging idea of system science is good science I guess very cool um now you work now at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory um you know I think some people aren't aware that there's like these different things you can do throughout science you don't have to just just to become a professor and work at a university there's there's also research institutions there's various ways to work throughout various industries that are related to science and engineering as well as National Laboratories um so what would you say is the best part of your job okay so we're never going to just say it with one thing right uh what I love about a national lab and they're kind of this black box that doesn't get advertised that well um you grew up going through Academia thinking oh you need to become this professor or if you go in Industry that's where the big bucks are I would say the National Labs are a great medium in between where we publish you can publish as much as you want you don't need to publish if you don't want to it's really what kind of science you want to do uh what I do like about the National Labs is that our government Congress sets aside money to make sure that we're on the Forefront of science right so we're really always pushing the envelope um and then we we want to work with other people right we have so many calls if you go through Doe's website to really get people universities come and work with us whether you're Community College undergrad High School really working with the National Labs you know I was worried when I was going to come to the National Lab I'm like oh I'm never going to be able to teach I'm never going to be able to connect with students but that's not true we have so many universities nearby and even in other states I connect with Georgetown quite often where I can mentor students and have no issues with that and if I have to say my favorite thing working at the lab is the freedom I have to be the scientist I want to be so I'm not going to speak for a professor at a university but you know you generate this lab you're expected to do a certain thing that's a sign to kind of go down you can kind of shift here and there but I don't know if you have as much Freedom as you do at a National Lab I came in I was a virus guy I'm working with another group as a virus guy I love it but there's other projects I can work on that may not even involve viruses or I can actually introduce viruses too and it's a system maybe I've never worked with and I absolutely love that it's just so open and welcoming that I can just work with other people here at the lab and that's excellent yeah it's I think it's one pathway people don't think about that much we will answer it up here as soon as we can to the audience questions I promise for those asking questions right now in the chat I will get to them but first my favorite of all of our faster than light segment uh is this question what is an unbelievable science fact that still blows your mind oof that's really hard yep I would just I mean really maybe it's a cultivation in fact it's the idea that there's things all around us that can affect us that we can't see right we think that we see something and that's that but our vision is actually pretty bad compared to animals out there um so I guess um okay let's think about this I think a fact that I really like is growing up you think of humans rule the world it's about humans you're not thinking about animals and everything else but we have literally been on the planet for seconds and minutes right geologic history is billions of years and we're just this little blip that's on here so the Earth had been around before us the Earth will continue to be around without us so we are just renting this hotel we're renting our time here and so it's just crazy that there was just this whole earth before humans I like that yeah there is so much time that we weren't here we are just the blink of an eye and who knows what the future holds as well um I will open it to our audience q a now we'll start off with a question from Twitter from Dr Jim pass Jim asks what risks may occur to humans settling on Mars over time um assuming that viruses uh or living extremophile bacteria exist there especially especially for astrobiologists and I think I'll add to that do we have any knowledge of how viruses change in the space environment yet yeah okay so I'm not a human virologist right um but I do feel I can answer this we when we send people into space your microbiome does change and we think it's largely due to stress it's similar to the stress we see here on Earth right we have microgravity um just a whole slew of things going on and if we're going to be on Mars it's going to be an environment difference in Earth so we're taking Earth organisms like our bacteria our Kiara fungi and biological entities like our viruses to a habitat that they're not used to being so even though they're within us we are keeping homeostasis to our environment and they have to adjust to that as well so there are risks we have to think about they're going to act different and if they act differently is that going to throw our system out of whack we need to think about our youth our sorry our health we also need to think about if it's going to change our mental state right our gut microbiome including viruses really affects our Mental Health so there's there's a lot of testing that we have to do and we are doing this now there's people on the International Space Station we see that when we send people to space and they come back their house does change if you have something like herpes or Chicken Box these are latent viruses you they come back they reactivate these people are not happy you you're you can get shingles um and this is something we have to think about when we're sending people into space now it doesn't always happen um but there's definitely research we need to do more there so I I would be worried not of a crazy Martian virus hurting us right we're going to be foreign why would they want to infect us viruses are usually host specific so they're not going to care about us but we need to think about our health and how our health is going to change I think we have this idea that oh as long as we have oxygen we'll be good no no we have a whole system that we need to think about and we really need to ask them what they want indeed we have a question from Kelly yoak on YouTube uh the question says does a virus attack fat or protein I'm thinking what their question is is how does a virus get into a cell um you know what is the pathway for to actually approach and attack the cell yeah uh I like your interpretation of I'm not sure I know how to answer that um so you can have viruses that can have tails um like a common bacterophage will have a tail it attaches to the host there's receptors that bind it opens up injects nucleic acid in or you can have enveloped viruses where they have their fat around them they attach the host cell membrane they fuse with it and the whole capsid comes in so is that what you're asking I guess I I think that's what Kelly was going for yeah I think so um here's a question um I'm not sure how you feel about this one uh this is from rendering reality 3D animations on YouTube um can we discuss the similarities with cryo pegs and Ice brine channels as having possible root connections to the origins of life for example for the formation of the first capsid um I'm guessing that they're you know given your your knowledge of Arctic and polar regions they're curious of your take on things like cryo pegs ice lenses and Ice brine channels for being potentially important for the origins of life okay so caveat here I've studied permafrost specifically the active layer above the permafrost that's seasonally thaws um some colleagues I worked with like Dr Pacifica Summers has done some cryopake work they would be more astute to be able to answer these kind of questions um but what I will say is if you're looking for early life like what I was talking about earlier going to the bottom of the deep ocean below the sediment or deep Earth we need to get to an area where life can be preserved and not affected and the problem is you know we have with plates at times we have the Earth is moving the Earth is constantly changing things are being destroyed being made so we need to make sure it's somehow preserved in a way where it's not going to get in a subduction zone or be lost or it's not going to just be okay so let me step back for a second if we think about fossils most fossils are found in the ocean right they can settle they can get preserved it's less likely to get Disturbed or on land if something settles it's going to be kicked around there's gonna be climate weather affecting it right so I think the idea of a cryopag is that it's this preserved sub ecosystem and that's definitely some something that we should be exploring more I would also argue that we should explore our ice cores from our glaciers and not just the glacier and the Arctic or in the Antarctic but a high altitude um ice chorus that we have and really start looking for viruses in there to look at past viruses and I think a common issue we're going to have and this is where we really need to push the envelope here is how do we work with low biomass right viruses there's not that much there I'm commonly from soils having to pull nanograms to picograms of nucleic acid to look at them so we need to become more sophisticated and very cool I agree entirely user AC on YouTube asks us a question about whether or not a chemoautotrophic organism could evolve in Rocky exoplanets out there much like they have on Earth and having anaerobic metabolisms that aren't dependent on photosynthesis but only on minerals for energy um so first off AC that's exactly what we know of for life here on Earth and so it makes entire sense that it could happen elsewhere uh and so I think for Dr tribal let's explore this a little bit more though um what do we expect for possible viral populations out there in the universe for instance if we find a world where photosynthesis never evolved do you think that would change the kinds of viral populations we might see that are out there uh yes and no I mean there's many verses that don't infect photosynthetic organisms right so they would be arguably the same I mean I think life's gonna be way different elsewhere we find it right but we don't have something to compare to so we don't know but there's viruses that in fact organisms that don't photos synthesize it's not like it's required for a virus a virus just needs something that's gonna have metabolism it's gonna generate ATP to take advantage of that's all it needs so whatever weird biology is out there the virus is going to fit to it no problem I think the question we should be asking is when we're looking for Life detection we need to think about the virus influence right so for biosignatures aviron itself is a biosignature if we're thinking about places where we can't Land Rovers and we're just wanting to sample atmosphere or maybe um measure from a distance we need to think about how viruses are influencing that signal right so we're thinking about stable isotopes and gas products for CO2 the fractionation of when it's made if a virus is infecting the host it's using the genes differently it's pushing this Machinery so the fractionations can be different so that I stop a signature of the gas is going to be different so just to give a background it when we're looking at I guess like a methane like methane um we look at the fractionation to really say a did it come from Life did it not come from life we can even get down to what exact metabolism did it so from methanogenesis it can be hydrogenotrophic or acetoplastic um you can have if I'm going to say this right hygienotrophic is negative 80 per male just to throw random numbers acetoclastics around negative 60 and then you can have variation right so life there's always variation what variation is caused by the virus what if it makes something look more abiotic because it's just pushing the genes and really this fractionation comes from as life when we use things we want to use the lighter isotope version sorry if I'm getting into signs here um and when the virus takes over the virus can just put put the pedal to the metal right it's like let's go let's go let's go let's get this done right so there that selection is not going to be is this not going to be happening as much right and so this is a lot of this is more research needs to be done right so I'm maybe speaking too much on this but when we're looking at life elsewhere when you think about what are viruses doing and we need to be thinking about an earth to better equip ourselves for looking for life elsewhere um I like that a lot and for our audience who may don't quite understand this idea of fractionation of stable isotopes it is worth looking into there are some really great explainers out there um what Dr Trudeau is saying basically when it comes to life and enzymes that life uses to to have metabolism and do things uh life tends to prefer using the lighter isotope over the heavy there are some very good chemical reasons for that and so we see a fractionation or a change in the Isotopes that are available being produced by life versus non life processes um and so that is very intriguing for us now I will say our next question um maybe someone just could use some help in the lab it sounds like so Dan in the cave has asked they've just started their PHD at the uh OU in the UK investigating microbial communities in the Botswana salt pans as an analog for Mars and they want to know if you have any tips for how to separate viral DNA from their soil core samples super cool that so that's always great especially when you're getting to do research when something is Sexy Cool It kind of it makes you it makes it easier to talk about and as science says sometimes it's hard right like if I have to talk about something in poo you're like well this is poo or if I have to talk about this and it's not that exciting so having something like that that's great that's always enjoyable um yeah so I can help you more if you want to email me we can chat about it but what's really hard is you need to be thinking about what is binding to the virus and is it causing the virus to precipitate out or is it causing uh is it protecting the virus so we you have to be able to tailor your methods to your ecosystem right so you have to think about the virus interacting with what's going on with around them to really be able to resuspend and pull the viruses out this is a major challenge we had in soils especially the peatland soils that I worked in because there's a lot of Organics so in especially in Northern latitudes you'll have plant biomass that just accumulates on the surface and it's slowly degraded so it's very fluffy you kind of walk across it like a Tempur Pedic mattress it's really nice it's bouncy uh it was it was cool to observe right um You can also have certain plants uh like muscles like sphagnant Monsters like bogs that are in blog sorry that producer in assets that inhibit growth right so you have a lot of plant biomass going on now the trick was to get the virions of virus particles off the soil particles and this plant biomass and make it pure to be able to resuspend that and that's difficult so we'd do a lot of testing in different buffers we do a lot of physical desorption methods to get those urines off um another thing that's helpful is by doing size filtration so viruses are really small and this again you're going to be pushing out most viruses you think about what viruses you're critically looking at so if it's double stranded DNA bacteriophage you can run them through a size filtration like 0.22 micron filter and really isolate your virus um so I I don't want to go too much more into it I'd love to be able to have a conversation so please just email me I'm happy to talk with you awesome uh yeah and you know for anyone starting a PhD programmer or any realm of research always reach out to the people who've done the work already and can help you in the laboratory there's no reason to build new methods or or bang your head against the wall I learned that the hard way myself as a graduate student when I I spend way too much time often in the lab trying to figure out how to do something when all I really had to do was ask somebody else who'd done it already it would have saved me a lot of time so yes so definitely please reach out to The Experts when you have questions on how to do your research uh our next question I think I'll take myself Marvel sushante on YouTube has asked if we could explain how coxolithophores are important to astrobiology um so for maybe our viewers not not really aware a coxolithophor is a marine phytoplankton uh they're a very prevalent calcifying organism on this planet that means they take calcium and the carbon dioxide that turns into bicarbonate out of the ocean and make calcium carbonate um they were they've been involved in forming Rock layers of calcium carbonate when you think of the White Cliffs of Dover uh in the UK those those Cliffs of Dover are chalk that are formed from the bodies of organisms that have calcified in the ocean from long ago and so it's important for us in astrobiology if we're trying to understand the nature of life how did life originate here or did it originate elsewhere and come here how did it evolve and change with our biosphere and our world over time and how can we find it out there and so understanding how organisms uh calcify in the environment how they create mineral structures in the environment is important for understanding what life does and for what we could look like look for out there maybe there have been calcifying organisms on Mars in the past or ancient Venus long ago um would any of those signs be left for us to find now we truly don't know yet um our next question comes to us uh Aruna Devi has asked can we find viral fossils in archaeological remains yeah that that's again hard um so you know when we're looking for these fossils and we're looking for ancient preserve life right we're looking at stromatolites and we have great evidence of stromatolites all over the world um I was fortunate enough to do the Agron geobiology course in 2014 and got to go and actually sample some stromatolites myself uh that was invaluable that those are great experiences so you know when we're looking for loss for these fossilized organisms or for biological entities what's really hard is Discerning between is it abiotic or is it biotic right and that's tricky we can't just extract nucleic acid out um so we possibly could find a virus it would have to it'd have to be an iconic shape like a bacteriophage and there would have to be great evidence to show there was no abiotic process that could help form that um I don't doubt that it's out there but I think it's it's easier to find with the larger organisms just because of where our resolution is with our current technology not to say it's not possible well let's talk about what's possible for just a moment then uh this next question I really appreciate from J.A Holt on YouTube um to what extent are we sure that life originated on Earth um we aren't um my life itself have been brought here now Jay says From Another Universe um and then the question goes the viruses um now we wouldn't say Another Universe Jay um we don't have any knowledge of Another Universe uh the very idea of a Multiverse is really rooted in some mathematics and and some speculation but we have no evidence that multiverses exist yet uh let alone that life could be brought here from that that far away wherever that is but there is this this idea called panspermia that life can be moved from one world to another and that maybe we are martians or maybe we're venusians maybe life started on another world and then came here uh and so I think Dr tribal for you as well we can have some fun and speculate here uh could viruses have come from another world and then been brought here what do you think absolutely I mean that's viruses role in life they don't have flagella they're not moving around like that they're hitchhikers they like to get in their house move on over to a different host sometimes they survive outside the house sometimes they go in the house so I think they're adapted to survive so possible yeah love it um so we have another question that I also really appreciate I'm glad our audience is like thinking speculatively here about what's possible with viruses and life uh so AC has another question they've asked uh what makes any of us think that viruses could be found uh in other exoplanetary ecosystems and not just be a fluke of terrestrial Evolution um and that's a good question uh do we have any reason to assume that viruses will exist in other worlds I mean we could say the same thing about any life um so if we think with of Life starting off as viruses if we're looking for life elsewhere then there would be a good chance that something of a virus would be there I think there is actually a better chance of a virus being found than some of the other things that we are possibly looking for and the reason is is because all the different things viruses can do right they move things around right there are these mobile genetic elements and they're critical to life so if we're going to find life elsewhere we're undoubtedly going to find viruses or a virus like entity and very cool all right so I think we have time for one more question uh so user Florian borius on YouTube has been asking um about how viruses might be able to have more resistance um to the space environment to other environments out there how they could uh survive and develop resistance to extreme environments in the cosmos um and you know I think you know we kind of have to think about what viruses are they themselves are not the ones that are producing necessarily the resistance um you know that they're they're taking over these populations of other cells of other beings that have developed resistance um so I think maybe a more enjoyable question for us to finish off here Dr Trubel would be um what is our knowledge right now of how viruses impact extremophilic organisms and and do they have any kind of role to play in the diversification of life to fill these more extreme environments yeah absolutely um man there's so many there's a lot of good research out there for anyone who is thinking about viruses especially in extreme environments I would tell you to look up Dr Kenneth Stedman uh professor at Portland State University he was a person that I really reached out to he's been a great mentor to really understand how viruses are really involved in astrobiology and extreme environments he has a slew of great papers so you know viruses it's what we say is an extreme environment it depends on the host right if a host is living there is it really extreme that may be where they Thrive it may be if you put them in something we find as a good environment that they actually get out competed they're not happy so when we say soil is Harsh I say not I think it's harsh to us right so I will say extreme to us but not necessarily to that organism um we know that viruses will take genes from their house we're still trying to figure out exactly how everything happens and why it happens but they can have these genes that we'll call auxiliary metabolic genes um and sometimes when they infected a new host uh you know another family member within the host they can take over the host and cause the host's genome or metabolism to express that Gene and make the host more fit so viruses can definitely help hosts survive and not only survive but maybe become more fit and out compete others in the environment very cool great way to finish off our episode uh Dr Trudeau thank you so much for joining us for asking astrobiologist um so if our audience did want to learn more about your research or your work what's the best way for them to reach out and find you so I really like Twitter because it's very informal I've just messaged other scientists and they get back to me and so I've Loved I come across not calling it Twitter but science sort of specifically all the other shenanigans that go on not really something I'm concerned with but just as the community of scientists it's a great way to reach out you can also feel free to email me um yeah I any any way that you think you can normally email someone I'm happy I'll check my emails uh if you I think what's hard is sometimes people message me just on LinkedIn or something I don't always check everything I probably check Twitter the most um but a good old email I check emails every day so let's just go with email works best love it all right Gary thank you so much for joining us it's been a great time having on the show to talk a little bit about astrovirology there's still so much more for us to explore and to learn for our audience who are tuning in if you want to follow along with more going on for ask an astrobiologist of course we have the hashtag on Twitter hashtag ask astrobio you can also sign up for the mailing list for the NASA astrobiology program you can learn more about current events New Opportunities and things that are going on across the realm of the NASA astrobiology program and so to all of you for tuning in thank you so much for joining us and as always until next time stay curious foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music]
