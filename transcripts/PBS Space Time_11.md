[MUSIC PLAYING]  Our universe is prone toincreasing disorder and chaos. So how did it generatethe extreme complexity we see in life? Actually, the laws of physicsthemselves may demand it. [MUSIC PLAYING] How did life begin? We can seek the answer in thechemistry of the early Earth or in the biologyof the first cell. In fact, our friendsat PBS "Eons" and "It's OK to be Smart"will do just that in companion videos to this one. But we all know thatchemistry and biology are just applied physics. So can we approach thequestion of the origin and the very nature of life fromthe point of view of physics? We're sure going to try. To understand life, weneed to understand entropy. The universe tendstoward disorder, decay, and equilibrium. A hot cup of coffee will tendtowards the same temperature as the room, and the hot, denseof our universe must expand. Stars always burn out. Black holes evaporate. The particles thatmake up any system all have some degreeof random motion. That random motion tendsto drive the system towards the most commonarrangement of particles. Such a random disordered,unspecial arrangement is a high entropy state. Interesting arrangements,like thermal energy being concentrated in your cupof coffee or all the matter in the observableuniverse being crunched into an infinitely densepoint are low entropy. They're highly specificconfigurations that almost never happen by chance. So entropy is sort of ameasure of the boringness of a system, the commonness ofthe arrangement of particles. The second law ofthermodynamics tells us that a closed system willonly increase in entropy. The universe willonly get more boring. But there's onetype of system that seems to resist the secondlaw of thermodynamics and maintain low entropy. That system is life. Life has a very lowinternal entropy because its structureis extremely specific and non random. The molecular machinery of evena single cell defies belief. You know what? I'd prefer to let a realbiologist convince you. Hey, Joe, tell them how it is.  Cells are complex. OK. That's a massive understatement. Inside just a singleone of your cells, you have six billionbase pairs of DNA, storing hundreds ofmegabytes of data. Intricate molecularmachinery made of RNA and protein unpacks,transcribes, cuts and splices, and processes that datato build and control an entire factory of proteinmolecular machines, which in turn, power the entirebiological process that is you. Easy, right?  Not only is lifestunningly complex, but that complexity increasesover extremely long time scales, in fact, over eons. Right, Blake?  When we look atthe fossil record, we see the evidence ofevolution carved in stone. When we trace the developmentof fossils over the nearly four billion years oflife on Earth, we see clear as day the studytrend toward greater complexity, from the firstsingle celled organisms to simple ocean invertebrates toan explosion of complex animal life and finally, to us.  Naively, this presentationand increase in order appears to contradict the secondlaw of thermodynamics   entropy appears to eitherstay constant or decrease. The Earth's biosphere, at least,becomes less boring over time. But let me be clear, there isno violation of the second law. The second law tellsus that closed systems must increase in entropy. So a system's unableto exchange energy with the outside environment. But living organisms andindeed the Earth's biosphere are not closed. Both receive energyfrom outside. Ultimately, that sourceof energy is the sun. Its light warms theatmosphere in the oceans and it powers photosynthesis atthe bottom of the food chain, driving a complex chainof nutrient synthesis that ends with whatever youhad for dinner last night. On the other hand, the systemof the Earth plus the sun is increasing in entropy. Life acts to reduce itsown internal entropy by increasing the entropyof its surroundings. This was first pointed outby Ludwig Boltzmann, who described life as astruggle for entropy, well, more accurately,against entropy or for negative entropy. Erwin Schrodinger, in his1944 book, "What is Life," describes life as a processfeeding on negative entropy. Life absorbs order and it ejectsdisorder into its surroundings. The type of orderthat life feeds on can be thought ofas free energy. By free energy, I mean thespecial out of equilibrium energy sources like acup of coffee or the sun. Another way to say this is thatlife feeds on energy gradients. When two systems with verydifferent energy densities come into contact,energy must flow. Life feeds on that flow. In fact, the importance ofenergy gradients to life can help us understandthe actual origin of life and its precursors. The origin of lifeon Earth isn't known. We think it started with aself replicating molecule similar to RNA. The companion episode, overon "It's OK to Be Smart," will get into thenitty gritty of that. Following that synthesis,evolution took hold, and the first protocell andthen first true living cell pulled itself together. PBS "Eons" will coverthat part as they explore LUCA, the lastuniversal common ancestor. But where on Earthdid this all happen? There are a few hypotheses. Perhaps it was in tidal poolsor around deep sea hydrothermal vents or even on theundersurface of Earth's ice caps. These environments sharea critical property. They sit at persistentenergy gradients. The water of tidalpools is both cooled by the earth and the oceanand warmed by the sun. Around deep sea vents,the searing gases from Earth's hot interiormeet the frigid water of the ocean depths. Beneath the thickice caps, there's the transition between the solidand liquid phases of water. These are places strugglingto return to equilibrium. These systems aredoing their best to obey the secondlaw of thermodynamics by redistributing their energyas evenly and randomly as they can. Heat energy flowsfrom hot to cold, seeking a uniformtemperature, but energy is also dispersed into everyform it can take consistent with the laws of physics. Some of that energy getsdistributed into chemical bonds as simple molecules form viaevery chemical reaction that's possible given theavailable raw materials. As those moleculesform, new channels open up for distributingenergy into the chemical bonds of increasinglycomplex molecules. Normally, this localrise in complexity would all cease when the systemreaches thermal equilibrium, energy is perfectlyevenly distributed and new moleculesbreak apart exactly as often as they're formed. But when our energysource is flowing into a much larger reservoir,why, the ocean, for example, then equilibriumis never reached. Complexity canincrease indefinitely as a byproduct of the systemstriving to redistribute the endless gradient in energy. And at some point, naturalselection takes over. Molecules self catalyze. They help drivethe very reactions that create more of the same. Molecules better at thatprocess become more abundant, and at some point, theybecome true self replicators and eventually,they become life. But even life andself replication might be a very natural partof the same thermodynamic drive to dissipate energy. I mean think about it. Living things areincredible heat dissipation entropy maximizing machines. The most randompossible form for energy is thermal radiation,and the lower the energy of itscomponent photons, the higher the entropy. A plant absorbs the concentratedultraviolet light from the sun and reprocesses it into a muchhigher entropy infrared heat glow. Animals consume high energydensity packets of matter called food and convert it tolower energy density waste as well as that sameinfrared heat glow. Life is great at dissipatingenergy, and more generally, it may be that self replicatingsystems are the best possible energy dissipators of all. This is a new idea proposedby MIT biophysicist Jeremy England, who puts thethermodynamics of life on more solid theoretical grounds. He's demonstrated mathematicallythat self replicating molecules and simple single cell life areextremely good at shedding heat in the act of reproduction. Self replicationrandomizes the environment, even if each new replicatoris highly ordered. And it's not justlife that does this. Consider a perfectly streamlinedor laminar flow of some fluid. This organized flow is disruptedby introducing turbulence. The laminar flow has a lowerentropy than the turbulent flow because there arefewer ways to rearrange the particles in theformer while preserving its global properties. But watch the transitionfrom laminar to turbulent. While the globalstructure is disrupted, substructure develops. Waves and vorticeshave their own complex and regular structures,but they ultimately serve to dissipate the flow. Any given eddy taken separatelyhas a lower internal entropy than its chaoticsurroundings, but the source of that local incidenceof low entropy is the streamline flowthat it formed in. And those turbulenteddies ultimately serve to increase theentropy of the greater flow. So given a much largersource of order, the global process ofdissipation of that order results in eddiesof low entropy. Life appears to bejust such an eddy. In the case of life,the original source of extreme low entropyis the Big Bang itself. In the process ofredistributing energy into the most randompossible state, little eddies of order, likegalaxies, stars, planets, and life naturally arise. These blips in order areactually serving the second law helping the universe disperseits early extreme low entropy state. So I guess that makes youa little eddy of order, a momentary fluctuation ofinteresting but ultimately, in service of the spreadof disorder and dullness, an agent in the inexorabletrend to maximize the entropy of space time. This episode is part ofa collaboration series with the amazing channels"It's OK to be Smart," and PBS "Eons." For the full story ofthe origin of life, be sure to check outthe companion videos. Just follow the links. Last week, we talked aboutthe mysterious Unruh effect, in which acceleratingobservers find themselves bathed in a sea of particles. You guys had a lot to say. Vacuum Diagrams points outthat from the point of view of an inertial observer, anaccelerating particle detector emits particles insteadof absorbing them. Well, that's right, and wedepicted that in the animation but decided it was a bittoo far down the rabbit hole for the episode. But in short, theinertial observer sees the acceleratingparticle detector click as though itregistered a particle, but the excitationbehind that click is seen to be dueto particle emission by the detector rather thanthe absorption of an Unruh particle. That emission looks likea straightforward quantum process, analogous to photonemission by an accelerating electric charge. Fernando Franco Felix pointsout something interesting. The inertial observersees that there's a type of frictionbetween the accelerating observer and thequantum field which should inhibit that accelerationby creating a type of drag. But the acceleratingobserver doesn't directly see that friction. So how do they explain thedrag, which they must also feel? The answer is that theaccelerating observer perceives themselves to be plowing througha bath of Unruh particles, and these produce the drag. The accelerating observermust expend more energy to produce thesame acceleration. Ultimately, that's the sourceof energy for whatever effects those Unruh particles cause,whether or not you actually see the Unruh particles. Moma the Belly Dancerasks whether this means that the expansionof the universe also causes an event horizon? Well, actually, yes. The cosmic eventhorizon is that service from beyond which we cannever obtain new information. We can actually seethat horizon today. It's around 16 billionlight years away. But the acceleratingexpansion of the universe will prevent anyphotons emitted today from galaxies at thatdistance or beyond from ever reaching us. Before they get to us,they'll find themselves in a patch of space that ismoving away from us faster than the speed of light. That horizon should producea type of Hawking radiation, but its wavelength would becomparable to the distance to that horizon, so it'scompletely undetectable. On the other hand, duringthe inflationary epoch in the extremely early universe,the cosmic event horizon was very close to every point. The inflating universeshould have been bathed in intense Hawking radiation. Alex Karolsonov notes thatthe Bremsstrahlung radiation created close tothe Schwarzschild radius of a kugelblitz mightcreate the Zitterbewegung effect. Nice. I'm sure you can bettersupport the [INAUDIBLE] of your Gedanken experiment byabseiling into that kugelblitz with a geiger counter.
