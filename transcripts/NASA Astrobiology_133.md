[Music] alrighty hi everyone thanks for having me today my name is Michaela Liang I'm currently a PhD candidate at the University of California Riverside um I'll be talking to you today about my work on novel methylated biosignatures and specifically their application to exoplanets which I usually don't have to say because I'm usually talking to astronomers so that's kind of fun um there's a little bit of a breakdown diagram here on the far side that's my left so your right um that's kind of showing the processing of these molecules all the way from surface fluxes atmospheric chemistry um the production of spectral features and we're kind of thinking about how this will vary across a variety of Stellar types so that's kind of just a very quick summary breakdown um so let's jump into talking about why we're specifically interested in these methylated gases um and the the answer is largely that there's a major false positive problem um for the first biosignature detections a lot of molecules um Like Oxygen ozone methane things like that that we expect to be potentially the first molecules detected um that could be connected to life in terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres can also be produced by a variety of planetary processes including thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry um and so these methylated gases are specifically uh almost exclusively produced by life and all of the other Pathways that we've investigated have been very minimal so we're really excited that these gases could potentially be a very strong affirmative uh signal of life and these gases are generated by the process of volatile methylation which actually we believe to be a descendant or perhaps a Rel relative in some way of the process of DNA methylation which for you biologists out there I'm sure you're all much more familiar with than I but we see volatile methylation in a variety of different ecosystems including microbial mats the open ocean and primarily actually a lot of terrestrial Marine uh kind of crossover ecosystems um we also see it done by a variety of organisms primarily a single cellular life but we do also see everyone's favorite Brassica vegetables um also produce methylated gases um and we think in particular that methylation is connected to the process of environmental detoxification um and that the Need For Life to kind of control its environment is possibly a fundamental characteristic of life itself and so when we're thinking about you know what life might look like under fundamentally different biogeochemistry um you know we're it's probably still going to need to be controlling that surroundings in some ways we're really excited about that potential tie in as well um we're not the first people to think about methylated biosignatures there are uh previous study specifically cigarette all 2005 and domigal Goldman at all 2011 which specifically show one an enhanced buildup level around M dwarfs and two a secondary ethane biosignature that's produced by atmospheric photolysis of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide and that produces a potentially detectable ethane signature um and so we're going to follow a relatively similar uh pathway we're jumping from labland that we've been in for the last couple of talks to modeling land um and uh primarily we're going to be talking about photochemical and spectral modeling basically thinking about how these gases are processed in the atmosphere and what those potential signals might look like um just jumping into some results um we have first here methyl bromide which is again on your left and we have methyl iodine which is on I think you're right um and you'll notice that as I said before for methyl chloride they see an atmospheric buildup level that's much higher around these M dwarf uh cooler better stars and we actually see that uh buildup replicated and actually even more enhanced for methyl bromide and this result from methyl is from like literally last week so that's brand new um and we're also seeing again the same sort of enhanced buildup you'll notice that it's to a lesser degree and we think that's probably because it's just a larger molecule and so it's a larger molecule it's going to be hit by more uh potentially active uh photochemical light so we use this photochemical model to to create profiles of gases in the atmosphere and kind of figure out where everything is where where it's at in the atmosphere and then we're using like I said a series of spectral models um so this these are mid infrared emission Spectra um and the most important thing that I'll call your attention to here there's kind of a lot going on but the bottom row is actually showing an experiment that we did where we add multiple methylated gases in this case methyl chloride and methyl bromide and you'll actually notice that the features that we see especially for Proxima Centauri which is going to be that plot all the way down in the bottom corner um that feature is actually a little bit wider and a little bit deeper than just kind of the simple sum of the features and that's partially because we're doing self consistent photochemistry um and so you do get higher buildup levels and also because this absorption feature near 10 microns is actually the acetah halogen Bond and so acetochlorine and Cedar bromine are sort of uh next to each other and overlapping a little bit but really creating this much larger feature um so we're optimistic that a future telescope capable of minimum infrared emission spectroscopy could detect these and we also think that while this could detect a methylated gas we could potentially fingerprint a specific methylated gas using extremely high resolution ground based spectroscopy um and potentially one mode that we could use for the emission spectroscopy that I was just showing is the life telescope which is a concept Mission that's actually run by the European Space Agency where they're using interferometry to essentially get a larger uh approximation of a telescope rather than putting like 100 meter telescope in space because that's actually going to be very difficult to do um and so you could see here that there's simulated error bars for the observations um and that there's kind of a noticeable difference between the atmospheres without these methylated gases and especially the higher flux cases and we can also look at this as a kind of comparison to the sigma of the detection and you can see we get some pretty significantly large features here and we're optimistic again that if any bio signatures are detected on these planets these are very optimistic planets were simulating for but hopefully these methylated gases will be among uh those bio signatures that it's possible to detect so I will leave you with my conclusions I think I am right on time um I'm at poster nine which is right on the other side of this wall or you can feel free to contact me my information is on the slide [Applause] foreign [Music]
